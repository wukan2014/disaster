son, Yasin, four, who has nearly drowned three times in his short life.', 'Photograph: RNLI Most of the deaths occur in rural areas between 9am and 2pm, when children are most likely to be unsupervised because parents are busy working and doing chores.', 'Local interviewers for the Bhasa survey, who have spoken to people from 40,000 households so far, have also found that in 97% of drownings in Barisal, no one in the area had cardiopulmonary resuscitation training.', 'For example, a community creche to supervise young children while their mothers do the household chores has
