challenge these traditional ideas and inform the country’s first nationwide drowning-prevention strategy.', 'The first part of the four-year Bhasa project, which means “rise up” in Bengali, is a household survey of 400,000 people, aimed at providing a detailed picture of drowning deaths, to identify where the worst problems are and where the most effort is needed.', 'In the past two decades, efforts to tackle childhood infectious diseases have yielded dramatic results in Bangladesh – under-five and infant mortality declined by 65% and 56% respectively between 2004 and 2014 , according to

has been done nationwide to tackle it.', 'Bangladesh is the most populous delta in Asia, made up of 80% floodplain: water is everywhere, swelling rivers, filling ponds, ditches and deep wells.', 'Forty-three per cent of drownings in children under five in Bangladesh happen in ponds, and 80% occur within 20m of the home.', 'His mother, Shahanas Ackter, 28, had asked him to bathe at the standpipe, but, instead he went to the pond behind the house, one of three deep ponds around their property, to play.', 'Ackter and her husband, Habibur Rahman, 43, are afraid of losing their second son, Yasin, four, who has nearly drowned three times in his short life.', 'Photograph: RNLI Most of the deaths occur in rural areas between 9am and 2pm, when children are most likely to be unsupervised because parents are busy working and doing chores.', 'Local interviewers for the Bhasa survey, who have spoken to people from 40,000 households so far, have also found that in 97% of drownings in Barisal, no one in the area had cardiopulmonary resuscitation training.', 'For example, a community creche to supervise young children while their mothers do the household chores has reduced the drowning risk of those participating by 82%.', 'Another project, to teach older children to swim, has reduced the chance of drowning by 90%.']", "terms": "{'river', 'death'}", "counts":
