[{ "title":"Chris Simpson obituary", "content": "At the age of nine, my cousin Chris Simpson talked of being a missionary like his Methodist great- and great-great-grandfathers. The impulse waned in religious terms but triumphed in a different field: journalism. Since his death, aged 53, from a suspected heart attack on assignment in Senegal, tributes have poured in from old hands and from younger ones whom Chris trained and helped until his sudden and unexpected death. He worked for the BBC in Angola during the 1990s civil war, in Rwanda after the 1994 genocide and in the Central African Republic and Senegal. Freelance radio, print and online work took him to a dozen other African countries where talking to ordinary people gave his writing its striking context and warmth. He was born in Perth, Scotland, and brought up in Cheltenham, where both his parents, William and Margaret (nee Briscoe), were teachers. He was educated at Cheltenham college independent school, where his father taught history, and took a degree in politics at Manchester University. He went on to study international reporting at City University, London, and cut his teeth on West Africa magazine. He then spent four years with BBC World Service radio at Bush House. Thus prepared, he began two decades of journalism from the continent he loved. He worked for the BBC for a decade. Much of his work was read by those with a particular interest in Africa, but he enjoyed many outings on BBC Radio 4’s feature programme From Our Own Correspondent. These gave rein to his wry style; Africa observed by a modern William Boot (the deceptively bumbling hero of Evelyn Waugh’s Scoop). Chris fell into things, whether a ditch or a scam involving a fake policeman, made spaghetti of computer leads and lost endless credit cards and mobiles. But, as Kate Adie said when the programme re-ran a piece in tribute, his hallmarks were “insight, sympathy, much humour and knowledge lightly worn”. He gave a voice to those too seldom heard. In terms of making a conventional name, Chris’s modesty and readiness to share information was not always in his best interest but won him a host of devoted friends. Andy Kershaw, his fellow broadcaster, finished his autobiography only because Chris gave up three weeks to interview him, asking the questions that he felt readers would want answered. Similar devotion was shown to students in West Africa, where he spent six years from 2005 training broadcasters for the United Nations Integrated Regional Information Networks. One of their many grieving Facebook posts has a line which would have delighted Chris: “More African than you, I have not known.” He is survived by his father, William, and sisters, Bridget and Gillian.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"China to ban ivory trade by the end of 2017", "content": "China will ban all domestic ivory trade and processing by the end of 2017, state media reported on Friday, in a move hailed by activists as a gamechanger for Africa’s elephants. African ivory is highly sought after in China where it is seen as a status symbol and prices for a kilo (2.2 pounds) can reach as much as $1,100 (£890). “China will gradually stop the processing and sales of ivories for commercial purposes by the end of 2017,” the official Xinhua news agency said, citing a government statement. The announcement follows Beijing’s move in March to widen a ban on imports of all ivory and ivory products acquired before 1975 after pressure to restrict a trade that sees thousands of elephants slaughtered every year. Xinhua said the complete ban would affect “34 processing enterprises and 143 designated trading venues, with dozens to be closed by the end of March 2017”. “This is great news that will shut down the world’s largest market for elephant ivory,” Aili Kang, executive director of the Wildlife Conservation Society in Asia, said in a statement. “I am very proud of my country for showing this leadership that will help ensure that elephants have a fighting chance to beat extinction. This is a gamechanger for Africa’s elephants.” Conservationists estimate that more than 20,000 elephants were killed for their ivory last year, with similar tolls in previous years. The WWF campaign group says 415,000 of the animals remain. Saving Africa's elephants: 'Can you imagine them no longer existing?' Read more The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), which took effect in 1975, banned the ivory trade in 1989. Like other countries, China permits the resale of ivory bought before the 1989 ban – and also has a stockpile purchased with CITES approval in 2008, which it releases for sale with certification. The WWF also praised China’s move to a complete ban but called on the Chinese territory of Hong Kong to bring forward a plan to end its ivory trade by 2021. “With China’s market closed, Hong Kong can become a preferred market for traffickers to launder illegal ivory under cover of the legal ivory trade,” said Cheryl Lo, senior wildlife crime officer at the WWF.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Jamie Murray: ‘I’ll say it – Andy is not the easiest guy to instantly warm to’", "content": "This would have been a big year for British tennis had just one Murray topped the tennis world rankings. Back in January, the odds of both becoming the best players in their category on the planet would have been even more laughably long. Jamie Murray was the brother from Dunblane who had never quite made it; who only three years earlier had come close to quitting. Now he ends 2016 as the world’s doubles No 1, on an equal footing with his singles champion brother. We meet at the Lawn Tennis Association training centre in south-west London. I am braced for the typical sport star entourage of officious agents and publicists, so when a tall, unexpectedly slight man appears in the lobby all by himself, for a moment I don’t even recognise him. The 30-year-old does not look at all like most professional sportsmen. There is none of the usual high-definition grooming or caramel-glow complexion, and his manner is gently warm and relaxed. If staff members didn’t keep stopping at our table to offer their congratulations, you would never guess he was a celebrity. Murray chats to each one with respectful affection, and a humility that appears to be entirely authentic. In fact, for a man at the peak of his career, Murray feels not so much jubilant as lowkey, even almost flat. He is known as the sunnier-natured of the two brothers, and is certainly laid-back and light-hearted, but there is no beaming smile, no obvious delight in his world No 1 status, so I am curious to know how much actual pleasure he gets from tennis. Would he ever play for the sheer fun of it? “No, I wouldn’t really do it, no. My mindset wouldn’t really allow me to do that.” Then what does he enjoy about being a tennis player? He considers the question thoughtfully. “I guess, for me, it’s seeing all the preparation and everything that’s gone into getting yourself on to the match court and competing and winning, and knowing that all that’s paid off.” Being ranked first in the world does feel good, he smiles. “But I guess it’s still more just the fact that I started playing tennis when I was four years old, and 26 years later I got to the top of my discipline. It was worth all the effort, the sacrifices, the highs, the lows, you know, all the perseverance. It was all worth it, because I got to the top of my sport, and I can say when I’m finished playing, ‘I got to No 1 in the world.’” Even now, though, the satisfaction of winning still cannot equal the pain of losing. “The losses, they really hurt, whereas winning is just what you’re supposed to do. That’s what’s expected of you. When I’ve lost matches I felt worse, far worse, than I have felt the pleasure of winning certain tournaments. Which is weird, I guess. I mean, this year I won two grand slams, which was amazing and of course I was really happy that both times we won. But I wasn’t like jumping for joy.” I could be playing with you this week, and next week I’m with another guy playing against you. That can make it awkward Jamie Murray Facebook Twitter Pinterest Murray brothers on Davis Cup victory – video Murray’s early promise on the court meant that by 11 he was already training full time and “treating it like a job”. His mother, Judy, had been a junior champion, and devoted herself to driving her two sons south every weekend to compete against English players. “When I was growing up I wanted to play against the best players in the world in the biggest tournaments on the biggest courts.” By 15, however, Murray had been overtaken by his younger brother, Andy. “I wasn’t really enjoying playing tennis. I wasn’t doing particularly well, and at that stage in my life I would have said it’s a very long way away from getting to the top of the world. My ranking was awful. Then I started to play doubles, and suddenly I was having more success. It wasn’t really a decision; singles wasn’t an option, and doubles was going to give me a chance to be able to make a career from tennis.” Murray won the Wimbledon mixed doubles title in 2007, but struggled to establish himself as a consistent contender, and was eclipsed in the public mind by his brother’s success. By 2013, he was demoralised, having worked through 14 different partners the previous season for no reward to speak of, and seriously considered giving up. But then he formed a successful partnership with the Australian John Peers, which went on to reach two grand slam finals. Ranked second in the world last year, he then found a new partner in the Brazilian Bruno Soares, and was duly rewarded with the No 1 ranking. I have always been fascinated by the personal dynamics of a doubles partnership. “Well, it’s pretty intense, because you’re literally with the person all the time. I would say that it is like a marriage. From the moment you wake up, you’re with that person, so if you don’t get on then when you get on the court and you’re in stressful situations, you’re not able to communicate well with your partner, and it’s not going to bode well for winning the match.” He is carefully vague about why his partnership with Peers ended last year, but reportedly blamed him for some defeats. “I kind of decided myself that I wanted to find someone else. Well, we weren’t getting on that well and it was just, kind of, like, I think we both fancied something a bit fresh, just new energies, that sort of stuff.” How did they reach an agreement to split? “I just emailed him, basically.” He literally sent him a Dear John? “Um, yes. Some people like to do it face-to-face, but nowadays people can text, send a WhatsApp message. ‘It’s not me it’s you’, that sort of thing. There’s so many ways to cop out of it now, aren’t there?” Doubles tennis is starting to sound like Tinder. “Absolutely, yes, and it’s a small dating pool as well.” All the players on the circuit are constantly eyeing each other up as potential future partners, “and of course it’s not like if we were together and we split up in a normal relationship, we would just go our separate ways. But I could be playing with you this week, and next week I’m playing with another guy and we’re playing against you. There’s no getting away from it, so that can kind of make it awkward.” I think that people now admire Andy's perseverance, his commitment and the effort that he’s made to get to where he is Jamie Murray Facebook Twitter Pinterest New balls: Jamie Murray, now world doubles No 1. Photograph: David Levene for the Guardian I can’t help thinking Murray is more temperamentally suited to doubles than his famously volatile, short-tempered brother. Murray radiates easygoing good nature, but even so I feel awkward to ask about the brother whose success has always overshadowed his career. I assume he must be fed up with questions about Andy, but in fact the only faintly defensive flash concerns his mother, and comes when I ask what it was like to grow up in a family completely obsessed with one sport. “My mum never pushed us to play tennis, so if we didn’t want to play tennis, we didn’t have to play tennis,” he says quickly. On the subject of his brother, he is perfectly forthcoming. “A lot of people, they only see him on the tennis courts, so they see him on TV and, you know he’s … I’ll say it as well, he’s not necessarily the easiest guy to instantly warm to and support, because you see him shouting and screaming all the time. He never looks happy or anything like that, so I understand that, and I get that, but I think that people now admire his perseverance, his commitment and the effort that he’s made to get to where he is.” Does Murray put the public antipathy towards his brother down to tensions between England and Scotland? “I think that whole ‘England-losing-at-football’ comment certainly put him on the back foot straight away with the country really, because so many people were upset.” (In 2006, a reporter asked which team he would be supporting in the World Cup and Murray joked: “Anyone but England, ha ha!”) “It was a joke, and the guy who wrote about it was an idiot. Andy got stitched up from a really young age, and the backlash from that was ridiculous, and it basically took him to, you know, cry after the final at Wimbledon for people to kind of like forgive him. Not that he needed forgiving for what he said, because it was a joke. But it took that moment nearly 10 years later for people to just come around to him.” Murray confirms his support for Scottish independence with such obvious caution that I think he must be worried about attracting the same sort of hostility. If there is any jealousy between the brothers, I detect no hint of it. Murray’s career winnings total less than $3m (£2.4m), compared to his brother’s $56m (£45m), and he can’t compete for the same lucrative sponsorship deals. He thinks that would change if doubles tennis were better promoted on TV, but seems quite philosophical about it. I wonder whether their contrasting success is in part down to personality differences; would he have been a better singles player if driven by the same sort of demons we see tormenting his brother on court? “It’s difficult to say. I think everyone’s different. I mean, someone like Federer, for example, he is unbelievably driven. He loves tennis. He loves what he does and you feel like he has a happy, balanced life, but he’s still incredibly successful. I think it’s just everyone’s different and everyone functions differently.” This sort of cautious diplomacy seems to come so easily to Murray that it’s a surprise when a question about drug testing elicits a more forthright response. Earlier this year, Maria Sharapova was banned for using a substance she claimed not to have known was prohibited, so doesn’t he worry that he could inadvertently contravene the rules? “No, I don’t. It’s never worried me, no. I think at the end of the day it’s your responsibility. I mean, like, the Sharapova stuff, it was a bit of a mess. If you’re taking medication and stuff then you’ve got to be aware of what’s allowed and what’s not. I mean there’s a website you just type in the thing and it tells you if it’s prohibited or not, so it’s a fairly basic process.” It isn’t easy to make a genuine mistake? “No, I don’t think it is. You’d have to do something stupid, I think, to do that.” The common mistake sport fans like me often make is to imagine that playing the game we love for a living must be the best job in the world. In fact, if anything, a sporting talent looks more like a curse than a gift. Even being No 1 in the world can’t deliver unadulterated joy – but to walk away from the court isn’t easy either. “All the ex-players I’ve spoken to always say: ‘Play as long as you can because nothing will compare to it.’ Most players, when they retire, they think: ‘I could’ve done things differently. I could’ve worked a bit harder. I could have put more time in on my fitness or I could have worked harder to get my serve better. Did I really get everything out of my career?’ I don’t think many people can probably say that they did.” Can he? He laughs and shakes his head. “Not yet. If I was to stop now, if I couldn’t play again, I’d be like: ‘No, I didn’t get the most out of it.’”",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"The Guardian view on Mayism: pragmatism over ideology", "content": "Loyalty to an ideological programme is rare in Britain. The labels that political activists use, often pejoratively, to define one another – “Thatcherite”, “Blairite”, “Trotskyist” – do not inform the voting intentions of the majority. Theresa May understands this pragmatic sensibility. “I don’t have an ‘ism’ other than Conservatism,” she has said. And by that she does not envisage a policy menu. Mrs May sees Tory values not as a doctrine but as cultural inclination and a social milieu – the parochial heart of Middle England. The prime minister’s unwillingness to define “Mayism” doesn’t mean such a thing will not emerge, as such concepts generally do, from the operation of her instincts on events. Already there is a discernible trajectory from old Conservative ideas towards something tailored to the challenges facing the country. A starting point is to understand what Mrs May is not. She is not an apostle of Margaret Thatcher, nor is she a Tory “moderniser” in the terms established by David Cameron. Most revealing is Mrs May’s complex relationship with liberalism. She is evangelical about global free trade but ready to compromise on economic openness for tighter immigration control. She supports gay marriage and women’s right to choose abortion, although she has voted in parliament for shorter term limits. As home secretary, she was no friend of penal reform. Leaving the European convention and introducing a British bill of rights remains on the agenda. She quietly endorsed the remain campaign and the tone of her subsequent embrace of Brexit goes beyond the technical task of decoupling from Brussels. The first post-liberal PM The prime minister interprets the referendum as an instruction to reshape the state to address the grievance of voters who felt marginalised through the years of accelerating globalisation. That is a cultural project as well as an economic one. It posits pre-referendum supremacy of an elite that was liberal, cosmopolitan and quick to ignore – even to despise – alternative perspectives. It follows that this elite should now be sidelined and its opinions discarded. It is true that a broad consensus – merging aspects of social and economic liberalism – gave continuity to the succession from New Labour to Tory-led coalition government in 2010. Mr Cameron’s claim once to have been the “heir to Blair” was not without foundation. Mrs May’s choice to define Brexit as the reaction to that continuum makes her Britain’s first post-liberal prime minister. Influential figures in Mrs May’s close-knit entourage are sympathetic to the “Red Tory” school of thought that combines a critique of social liberalism and free market libertarianism. This analysis identifies a corrosive interaction between two successive revolutions of the 20th century: the left-leaning, permissive culture of the late 1960s and the rightwing fixation on profit-seeking as the agent of progress that was the kernel of Thatcherism in the 1980s. Red Toryism rejects neither movement outright but says that their combination led to a cult of individual self-gratification, expressed through materialistic consumption, at the expense of community wellbeing. Red Tories explain selfish individualism as an unintended consequence of the 1980s. Mrs Thatcher, they say, extrapolated too much from her own Methodist faith and austere work ethic, believing that people would use their economic freedoms judiciously and charitably – restraining licentious appetites and diverting surplus profit into philanthropy. She underestimated the importance of the state as referee in the distribution of fair reward. There is an intriguing symmetry here with the “Blue Labour” critique of liberal third-way politics. In this account, New Labour was insufficiently sceptical of the capacity of the state to effect social change by cash redistribution from the centre, overly squeamish in facing the impact of mass migration and neglectful of the resonance in traditional Labour-voting areas of identity, community and place as drivers of political allegiance – faith, flag, family. Insofar as Mrs May imagines herself occupying a new post-liberal centre ground of politics, it is in the space where Blue Labour and Red Tory sensibilities intersect. Europe still matters By the end of the 20th century, left liberals had won the culture war, and right liberals had won the economic war. Cultural conservatives felt aggrieved that their values were being traduced while the left felt they had been sold out. Mr Cameron’s Tory “modernisation” aggravated the offence on both sides. The reactionary right saw it as an ultra-cosmopolitan project symbolised by Mr Cameron’s support of gay marriage and short-lived dalliance with environmentalism. The left saw his “big society” rhetoric as a front for reheated small-state Thatcherism. Liberalism was the dominant governing ethos of a generation, yet liberals were scattered across party lines. The closest they came to unity was the gathering of disparate forces in defence of EU membership – an unloved proposition which became the proxy for a social and economic settlement that, in reality, had little to do with Brussels. Since she became prime minister on 13 July, Theresa May has maintained a double digit lead over Labour Mrs May is now committed to delivering radical change through that same proxy. Brexit has become the totemic mission of national renewal and yet EU membership is not the underlying cause of voter discontent. None of the ambitions she has declared for a fairer society is obviously connected to that mission. She talks about rebalancing the economy with an “industrial strategy” and professes commitment to workers’ rights. She pledges corporate governance reforms and crackdowns on tax avoidance to social responsibility on big business. She understands that a housing shortage and wage stagnation feed anxiety that today’s children will never sustain the lifestyle enjoyed by their parents. In her 2016 conference speech she invited her party to remember “the good that government can do”. She wants to deploy state power in defence of people who feel they are “just about managing”. But she must know that the destabilising consequences of divorce from Europe’s single market will worsen their plight before any benefits are realised. Balancing act The place where Brexit most satisfies the post-liberal narrative is also the point where the argument is weakest – the assertion that social and economic malaise can be healed by ending foreign infiltration of British workplaces. There is a grim logic that will lead Mrs May to indulge that misconception in order to buy permission from her party to pursue other things. But she has only a vague aspiration to palliate the negative consequences of British capitalism and no policy equal to the task. It is unclear how deep a commitment to that agenda runs through the Tory party. The more radical side of Mrs May’s ambition is a partial repudiation of an economic legacy still fetishised on the right of her party – the conviction that government is the obstacle to progress and that a shrunken state, with fewer labour protections, yields a more enterprising society. A backlash has been averted because the prime minister is simultaneously satisfying a long-held desire of the same section of her party – hardline Euroscepticism. Conflict is deferred, not avoided. Meanwhile, extracting Britain from EU membership will consume all of the administrative capacity of government for the foreseeable future.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Greek envoy's wife and two men detained in Rio de Janeiro over his death", "content": "Authorities in Brazil believe that the Greek ambassador who went missing on 26 December has been killed and have named his Brazilian wife, a police officer and another man as suspects in the case. Local police have said that the officer, who was romantically involved with the diplomat’s wife, has confessed to the killing at her direction. The third man, believed to be the officer’s cousin, is believed to have acted as lookout and helped move the ambassador’s body. All three are being held in jail as the investigation continues, the investigators told a news conference in Rio. Police have detained the suspects for 30 days on a judicial order and will recommend charges against all three for homicide, said Adilson Palacio, a spokesman for the Rio homicide division. He said that the indications were that a body found in a burnt-out car was that of Kyriakos Amiridis, 59, who was reported missing on 28 December by his wife, Françoise Oliveira. She told police that Amiridis had left the condominium where the couple were staying in Nova Iguaçu, a town 25 miles inland from Rio de Janeiro, two nights earlier, without saying where he was going. The couple had been together 15 years, and have a 10-year-old daughter, according to another officer working on the case, who was not authorised to give his name publicly.. Palacio said that bloodstains believed to be from the ambassador were found on a sofa inside the home of his wife. “Her family had a residence in the city. They are from Nova Iguaçu,” Palacio said. The investigation of a foreign diplomat was made a priority, he said, and investigators “haven’t slept for two days”. Officers revealed at a press conference that the detained officer worked at a station in the central Rio favela of Fallet.

Hildegard Angel, 67, a Rio-based journalist, said Amiridis had been a good friend and a popular figure at dinners and parties while he lived in the city. “He was a very interesting man,” she said. “A man of the world. Agreeable, sociable, informed. You wanted to go to Greece, talking to him.” But Angel said nobody had known he was married when he lived in Rio. “In refined society in Rio de Janeiro, he was invited to everything. He always circulated alone. He was a bachelor, always invited to dinners,” she said. Angel said she first discovered that he was married after media reports of a robbery at his house in 2003 were referred to a wife.

{ "title":"Sterling's slide: winners and losers in 2016", "content": "Uncertainty over the outlook for the UK economy after the Brexit vote in June has sent the pound plummeting to levels not seen since the 1980s. After the initial falls, Theresa May’s announcement that she would trigger article 50 by March and continuing talk of a hard Brexit piled more pressure on sterling. As did an emergency cut in interest rates from the Bank of England, the effects of which were exacerbated by the Federal Reserve’s move to raise US borrowing costs. Since the EU referendum, sterling has lost more than 17% of its value against the dollar and about 10% against the euro. The slump has been a mixed blessing for Britain’s leading companies, with some clear winners and losers. Winners Businesses which make most of their money overseas are the most obvious beneficiaries of sterling’s slide, since their earnings are now worth more when translated back into pounds. The luxury goods group Burberry, which generates about 85% of its sales abroad, has emerged as a clear winner, with overseas revenues bolstered even as its UK costs remain fixed. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Burberry runway show. The luxury goods retailer has benefitted from the pound’s decline. Photograph: Suzanne Plunkett/Reuters The icing on the cake is the weak pound attracting a growing number of overseas tourists, from China and elsewhere, to the UK keen to snap up its trademark checked scarves and camel trenchcoats. Burberry said this week the pound’s decline had lifted sales to tourists in its London stores by 30%. Its shares have jumped by about a third since referendum day, adding more than £1.5bn to its market capitalisation. Associated British Foods expects to benefit from the rising value of the euro against the pound. This will lift overseas profits, which last year made up half of the total, once they are translated back into sterling, and boost margins at ABF’s sugar business, although the group’s Primark fashion chain’s UK profit margins are taking a hit from the pound’s fall because clothes are largely bought in dollars. Mining groups listed on the London Stock Exchange but with operations everywhere from Australia to South America are also toasting the weak pound. Commodity prices are quoted in dollars, which lifts the value of the metals they mine in pound terms and boosts their profits. On top of that, precious metal miners such as Randgold Resources and Fresnillo have benefited from the recent strength of gold and silver, seen as havens in times of uncertainty. Other global businesses such as pharmaceuticals GlaxoSmithKline and AstraZeneca benefit from the exchange of overseas earnings into pounds, and are also supported by the relatively stable outlook for their businesses (threats by the US to clamp down on supposedly excessive prices notwithstanding.) Banks have had a more mixed time. Again overseas earners are to the fore, with HSBC, which makes around three quarters of its profits in Asia, and Barclays gaining ground. HSBC has had a hefty £37bn added to its stock market value since the referendum. Banks focused on the UK, such as Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds Banking Group have performed less well. Bookmakers have benefitted too, recording their biggest non-sporting event ever at the referendum, with punters placing £100m in bets. Most punters bet Britain would stay in the EU. Losers The companies most obviously hit by the falling pound are those most exposed to the UK economy, with the cost of imported goods rising just as demand seems set to weaken. If consumers are faced with having to pay more in the shops, they are likely to be more cautious with their spending. Supermarkets are facing increasing price pressures, as shown in the so-called Marmitegate dispute between Britain’s biggest grocer Tesco and consumer goods giant Unilever. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Unilever and Tesco clashed over plans to increase Marmite prices by 10%. Photograph: Christopher Thomond for the Guardian Unilever raised prices on a range of products, from Marmite to Cif, by about 10% and halted deliveries to Tesco when the supermarket refused to accept the rises. This left Tesco short of several popular household brands. Although the dispute was resolved within days it is a sign of things to come in what is already a cut-throat and price-driven sector. Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: “Looking forward into 2017, the sector faces a new challenge from the rising cost of imported food, thanks to the fall in sterling, which will probably apply pressure to margins against such a competitive backdrop.” Staying on the high street, Sports Direct issued another profit warning in October – its third of the year – after it lost £15m in the currency markets as a result of the overnight “flash crash” in the value of sterling. Next estimated in August that its clothing prices would rise by up to 5% next year due to the pound’s decline. Its chief executive, Lord Wolfson, said the cost of buying goods from abroad in sterling had risen by 9% for next year’s fashions, although some of thehit would be offset by weakness in other currencies and its ability to squeeze better deals from suppliers. House prices are flat or falling as the weak pound dents consumer confidence and Brexit uncertainty pushes buyers out of deals. Housebuilders are facing weaker demand just as costs are rising. Bellway said some of its suppliers were likely to raise their prices due to the higher pound. Suppliers of imported timber have indicated that prices could rise by 10%. About 70% of Bellways’ materials are sourced from Britain, with 20% coming from Europe. “I’m sure we’re going to have what we would call some sort of Unilever moments with some of our suppliers,” the chief executive, Ted Ayres, told Reuters. Shares in the building sector have been under pressure since the referendum, with Britain’s biggest quoted housebuilder, Persimmon, losing 15% of its market value since the vote, equivalent to more than £1bn. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Currency movements have had a negative impact on airlines. Photograph: Alamy Airlines are also suffering, as the falling pound makes travellers more reluctant to venture abroad and consumers decide to conserve their cash. Ryanair recently warned that full-year profits would be lower than expected, while EasyJet suffered its first fall in annual profits for six years due to the weak pound and discounting fares. EasyJet expects another drop in the current financial year. Currency movements cost the airline £88m as the pound’s decline against the dollar increased fuel costs.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"More than 2.3m families living in fuel poverty in England", "content": "More than 2.3 million families are living in fuel poverty in England – the equivalent of 10% of households, according to government statistics. Almost 60,000 households in Birmingham alone cannot afford to heat their homes. The figures from the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy show the West Midlands city is worst affected, with Leeds, Cornwall, Manchester and Liverpool also in the top five local authorities where households face “eat or heat” choices in winter. However, rural areas of England are proportionally the worst affected, with more than 20% of households on the Isles of Scilly classified as fuel poor. Other badly affected areas include Eden in Cumbria, Richmondshire and Ryedale in North Yorkshire, and West Devon. Fuel poverty is calculated by gauging if a household’s income would fall below the official poverty line after spending the actual amount needed to heat the home. The average fuel poverty gap of these households – that is, the amount needed to escape fuel poverty – is £371 a year, the latest figures indicate, with those in privately rented properties hit hardest. About 20% of households renting from a private landlord are classified as fuel poor and single parents with dependent children are at the highest risk, with almost 25% in fuel poverty. Clive Lewis, the shadow business secretary, said the figures showed the Tories had to take action to tackle the tariffs of the big six energy companies. “Under the Tories’ lack of an energy plan, Britain is facing an energy bill crisis, with over 2 million families who can’t afford their energy bills,” said the Labour MP. “The government must act now on the monopoly of the big six in the energy market and tackle the scandal of fuel poverty. A Labour government will deliver clean energy and curb energy bill rises for households.” This month, the business department said it would publish an energy supplier league table to instantly show consumers where they could save money on fuel bills. Customers should have the ability to access their energy usage data quickly and easily from their energy companies, the government said, to allow them to use price comparison sites to switch tariffs.

{ "title":"Good to meet you… Jennifer Palethorpe", "content": "I am 41 and originally from Stoke-on-Trent but now I live in Nantes. I did my PhD at Nottingham University and then worked there as a human biology lecturer and education researcher, although now I teach English rather than science. We moved to France three years ago when my husband’s former company was bought out by a French firm. I don’t know how long we will be here. I used to think that home doesn’t really change when you are away, but after recent events I might have to rethink that one. It’s been a great adventure so far; even being surrounded by things you can’t understand can be relaxing as you have to let things slide. Occasionally, of course, the language or cultural barrier is insurmountable, and then I get a fleeting insight into how it feels to be immutably “different”, since I will always sound like René Artois from ‘Allo ‘Allo. Most of the time, though, people are friendly and helpful and I plough on, making well-meaning grandes bêtises. Probably the most scarring to date was trying to describe a new skate park’s half-pipe to some French friends and yet somehow in fact managing to describe fellatio instead. I couldn’t be corrected immediately as my new so-called friends were all laughing at me too much. My parents are not particularly political and so the only newspaper I remember having in the house was our local The Sentinel. I started reading the Guardian regularly when I was a student, initially because I really liked Graham Rawle’s Lost Consonants. As I didn’t read national newspapers much before, I hadn’t realised they could be so different, although a I did a week’s work experience at the Daily Express one summer and all I remember is that they wanted me to find pictures of Princess Diana wearing similar outfits to Camilla Parker-Bowles. The Guardian (where I failed to gain any work experience) was by contrast, a natural fit. When I have a whole paper to choose from I prefer the sections on the environment, health and technology. I also like to read the opinions. I always have time for Polly Toynbee. The sections I always discard (or give to my friend Ruth) are those on travel (I mostly find other people’s holidays so dull) and property (I honestly don’t enjoy snooping around other people’s houses). The series of stories that stands out most in my mind was the exposé that started in 2011 about phone hacking at News International. The whole affair was a great piece of journalism, although the subject was so tawdry. The mesh between the press and Westminster was fetid, though after both Brexit and the US elections I am feeling almost resigned about it now. I was a keen supporter of remain as I appreciate what the EU has brought to the UK in terms of research, legal protection, employment and peace. I found that many of the articles I read as external links from friends on Facebook or via Twitter were from the Guardian online. I found their style to be more reasoned, less simplistic and usually less fear-mongering than the some of the other stuff out there. I do worry that I am rolling around like a fat pup in like-minded opinion. I follow people with quite different viewpoints on Twitter and that is always insightful, if complicated. I think Brexit was motivated by a genuine desire for change, but for me the way it happened has just left the bit from Animal Farm about looking “from pig to man, and from man to pig, and from pig to man again”, and how it was “impossible to say which was which”, rolling around inside my head. • If you would like to be interviewed in this space, send a brief note to good.to.meet.you@theguardian.com",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Ten ways to save money on your holiday flights", "content": "Book early for the best deals, say travel agents; January and February are the busiest months for tour operators as families book for the summer. But research has found that while you should book ahead for short journeys on such airlines as Ryanair or easyJet, it’s better to wait until much later for the best deals on long-haul flights. The best time to book a short-haul flight is at least 70 days (2.5 months) in advance of flying, according to online booking agent Tripsta. But if it’s a long-haul destination that you’re after – such as New York, Bangkok or Sydney – then it is better to hold your nerve and wait until closer to your departure date. The researchers found that for long-haul travel you should book no more than 47 days in advance, “and if you are brave enough, try leaving it even later”. BA owner to launch low-cost flights to US from Barcelona Read more For example, Guardian Money tested flights to New York departing next Saturday, 7 January, returning two weeks later on Saturday 21 January. The cheapest deal for a direct flight was £410 on Virgin Atlantic. Booking far in advance, for an equally quiet period of travel in late November 2017, the cheapest price for a direct flight was £482. But if you follow the same strategy with Ryanair or easyJet, you are likely to get your fingers burned. Their business model is to offer the cheapest tickets on a first-come, first-served basis; as the clock ticks down towards the departure date the prices begin to rise. However, note that Ryanair holds sales on some routes around two to three months ahead of departure date, so keep an eye out for those. There are many other tips for bagging a bargain on flights. Here are our top 10: 1. Always book on a Sunday According to Expedia, more business travellers make bookings on Fridays, and the airlines and hotels price accordingly. By choosing to book on a Sunday (although not necessarily travelling on a Sunday) you can save up to 30%. 2. Buy long-haul on Tuesdays According to website Skyscanner: “Quite a few airlines release their last-minute weekend deals on a Tuesday, as they tend to start their sales on a Monday evening – as competitors scrabble to compete, by Tuesday afternoon you could be bagging a sweet bargain on your air fare.” 3. Stay away over a Saturday By including a Saturday night stay in your flight you can save up to 34% on average when travelling within Europe, says Expedia, but this rises to 74% for flights within central Europe. “Airlines often try to segment business versus leisure travellers by filing cheaper fares that require a Saturday night stay,” says Expedia. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Including a Saturday night stay can save you up to 34% on average on your flights when travelling within Europe. Photograph: AFP/Getty Images 4. Try this easyJet trick Martin Lewis of MoneySavingExpert says there’s a loophole in easyJet’s “Flexi” fare, which allows you to get round peak time prices in the summer school holidays. “Book a Flexi fare on the same route at a less busy time, when flights are cheaper; after 24 hours, provided there’s capacity, you can switch it to the dates you originally wanted at no extra charge. It’s not the easiest trick in the book, but if it works it could save you hundreds of pounds,” he says. 5. Remove cookies It may be an urban myth, but regular flyers swear that flight prices increase when a particular route is repeatedly searched. You can delete cookies by heading to the internet options button in “tools” on Microsoft Internet Explorer, or by heading to “settings” in Google Chrome. 6. Avoid some specific dates These are always the first five Fridays of the school summer holidays. Tripsta says flights to Alghero in Italy, departing this summer on Friday 4 August, were selling for £304, but if the traveller switched dates to Wednesday 17 August the price fell to £143. 7. Return on a Friday A summer trip to Alicante was £325 booked last minute and returning the following Sunday. If the traveller could face returning on the Friday, and had booked earlier, the price dropped to £110. Facebook Twitter Pinterest There are ways to avoid paying more for flights during school holidays. Photograph: Luke Macgregor/Reuters 8. Use different search engines Skyscanner is great for a quick overview of prices. But be wary of excessive card charges made by some operators which enable them to offer “cheap” flights but which come with a sting in the tail. Kayak allows you to filter options based on card fees. Momondo is good for inspiration. Expedia is good for flight/hotel combinations. In the US, try AirfareWatchDog for alerts on cheap deals. JacksFlightClub claims to hunt down pricing errors and email you when they occur. 9. Consider split ticketing Take the concept of “split ticketing” on the railways and apply it to airlines. That’s what Skiplagged.com does after discovering that sometimes a flight that connects in the city you want to go to is cheaper than flying directly to it. They call it “hidden city flights”, although it only really works in the US. Its promoters are currently engaged in a legal battle with United Airlines, and it can only work if you have no luggage apart from carry-on. 10. Mix and match It’s always cheaper midweek, on both short and long haul. And always check single as well as return ticket prices, and mix and match airlines. There is no rule that says because you choose to fly Ryanair to Madrid you can’t fly back with easyJet. Expedia’s new loyalty scheme Expedia is the first major holiday booking website to launch a loyalty programme, similar to air miles. It will give holidaymakers two “Expedia+” points for every £1 spent on a flight-plus-hotel package, or one point for every £5 spent on flights.Points can then be used to obtain as much as 3% off the price of further bookings, with no ‘blackout’ periods common on other travel reward schemes. A couple heading to Ibiza this summer on a £2,450 package including flights, hotels and car hire would qualify for £67 off the price of their next trip, or equal to 2.75% cash back. Expedia also promises free room upgrades and other perks for travellers who book at least 15 nights and enter its “gold tier” membership, although members of Expedia’s similar scheme in the US have complained that upgrades have sometimes failed to materialise. As with all loyalty schemes, travellers should check the price of flights or hotel combinations on a variety of websites before booking, but if Expedia is the cheapest there is no harm in joining the rewards programme, which is free. Using Expedia+ does not stop you collecting on other schemes such as Nectar or using their credit cards to pay for flights and pick up air miles. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Londoners could find that flying to Dublin is a lot cheaper from Birmingham airport. Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty Images Flying from a different airport can save a lot of money Flying home for Christmas and the New Year can be an expensive affair, Shane Hickey writes, even if you book well in advance. A few years ago, faced with return fares of £400 for two for a trip from London to Dublin, I found an unlikely, cheaper alternative: Birmingham airport. Living in north-east London, flying from Stansted makes the most sense. At Christmas, however, prices skyrocket, particularly for the most convenient times of day. Travelling to Birmingham airport, meanwhile, takes just an hour and 10 minutes from Euston, and the station is located in the terminal building. Flights cost just over £190 for two return when they were booked at the start of October – some 50% cheaper than if we had flown from Stansted or Heathrow. The return train fares to the airport came in at £38.40, after savings from a Two Together railcard were applied. Planning ahead is key for Christmas and New Year travel on budget airlines – return flights for two people to Dublin from London, booking just before Christmas, were £696.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Coral Atkins obituary", "content": "The actor Coral Atkins, who has died aged 80, found fame on television in the 1970s in A Family at War, which ran for 52 episodes and attracted audiences of more than 20 million. Her character, Sheila Ashton, was the downtrodden and neglected wife of a womanising RAF sergeant, David (played by Colin Campbell), and a heroine of the semi-autobiographical series created by John Finch. The ITV drama (1970-72) followed a lower-middle-class Liverpool family from 1938 to 1945, their emotional conflicts running parallel to the greater events taking place across Europe and then the world. Atkins found herself showered with flowers, receiving stacks of fan mail and forever being stopped in the streets by people shouting out to “our Sheila”. However, she turned her back on fame after a life-changing event. In the summer of 1970, she had opened a fete at a children’s home outside Manchester. When the ceremonials were over, she heard screaming. “I found her in the kitchen, a girl of four or five,” recalled Atkins. “She was clawing at the walls, her eyes were wild, she was just gone, completely gone.” Staff simply ignored the child and, when Atkins showed concern and cuddled the girl, she was told by the establishment’s matron that it was a mistake to get emotionally involved. This experience led her to set up her own home for disturbed children. She rented Crossways, a 20-room thatched property in the Berkshire hamlet of Hoe Benham, renovated it and jumped hurdles to ensure that facilities met legal standards. She received great help and advice on tackling bureaucracy from a former Conservative MP, Godfrey Nicholson, who also introduced her to a distinguished psychiatrist, and she finally opened her doors in 1972. Nine years later, she qualified as a psychotherapist. In between, Atkins suffered a nervous breakdown, underwent therapy herself and discovered that her desire to help children emanated from her own traumatic wartime experiences, when at the age of three she was evacuated to an isolated farm in Wiltshire with her elder sister, Sylvia. She recalled feeling abandoned by their parents and being neglected and beaten by the person in whose care they had been put. “I became convinced that I was Red Riding Hood and this woman was going to eat me,” she said. As a result, Atkins was unable to see the colour red until her therapy sessions. Her 1990 autobiography, Seeing Red, was turned into a TV drama of the same title, starring Sarah Lancashire, 10 years later. In 1985, Atkins opened a second children’s home, in Putney, south-west London. Five years later, both homes and their children were merged into one at Gyde House, in Painswick, Gloucestershire. Over 26 years, she cared for 37 children. Atkins was born in Kingston-upon-Thames, south-west London, the daughter of Lilian (nee Millson), who later wrote poetry and children’s stories, and Eric Atkins, an electrician, who painted and exhibited at the Royal Academy. The family lived in Tooting, south London, and, after Atkins’s wartime evacuation, moved to the Berkshire village of Bucklebury, and then nearby Kingsclere, Hampshire. Educated at Shaw House school, Newbury, Atkins started studying art at Winchester college but abandoned the course on discovering that she did not possess her father’s creative flair. Aged 17, she decided on a career in acting and joined Armstrong Productions, a travelling repertory company. Further rep experience followed in Guildford, and the West End beckoned with the John Osborne play Inadmissible Evidence (Wyndham’s theatre, 1965). After making her TV debut with a one-off role in Emergency – Ward 10 (1960), Atkins had bit parts in popular series, as well as the Alun Owen play The Hard Knock (1962), playing a tough Liverpool girl, and Jack Rosenthal’s The Night Before the Morning After (1966). When A Family at War ended, she concentrated on running her children’s homes, but there were occasional small roles on screen, in programmes such as Callan (1972) and The Sweeney (1975). There was a more substantial part in Flesh and Blood, another Finch family drama – this time set in the writer’s native Yorkshire – in which she played Ruth Turner during its first series (1980). Later, in 1993, came a short run in the soap opera Emmerdale as Ruth Jameson, a former girlfriend of Frank Tate (Norman Bowler) visiting his Holiday Village. In 1997, Atkins suffered a punctured lung and broken leg and ribs in a head-on car crash, and a year later her children’s home closed under financial pressures. She then spent five years working as a psychotherapist. Atkins’s 1960 marriage to the actor Jeremy Young ended in divorce. She had a six-year relationship with the director Peter Whitehead, with whom she had a son, Harry, who survives her, as does Keith Skinner, her partner of the past 16 years. • Coral Rosemary Atkins, actor and psychotherapist, born 13 September 1936; died 2 December 2016",diasaster:0},

Prof Jane Francis, the director of the British Antarctic Survey and a veteran of more than a dozen expeditions to the Arctic and Antarctica, receives the award for her services to polar science and diplomacy. “It’s a complete surprise and I’m greatly honoured,” Francis told the Guardian. She will travel to Antarctica on Sunday for a week and again at the end of January to visit the Halley research station, which is being moved to avoid an ominous-looking crack in the ice sheet. Francis, who first sailed into Antarctic waters on a BAS expedition in 1989, said: “The word awesome was invented for Antarctica. It completely blows your mind. It is incredibly beautiful, but also very humbling. Being a fragile human in such a cold and remote place can be daunting.” Also awarded a damehood is Prof Amanda Fisher, the director of the MRC Clinical Sciences Centre at Imperial College in London. Fisher’s discoveries helped pinpoint HIV as the virus that causes Aids. The honour also recognises her work on stem cells and epigenetics, and her advocacy for women in science.

The 53-year-old singer was found dead at his home in Goring-on-Thames, Oxfordshire on Christmas Day. Michael’s publicist said his family and friends had been “touched beyond words” by the “incredible outpouring of love” from fans, adding that there were no suspicious circumstances around his death. The postmortem was carried out on Thursday. Thames Valley police said: “The cause of death is inconclusive and further tests will now be carried out. The results of these tests are unlikely to be known for several weeks. “Thames Valley police will prepare a file for the Oxfordshire coroner. Michael’s death is still being treated as unexplained but not suspicious.” Fadi Fawaz, who began seeing Michael following his split from former long-term partner Kenny Goss, said he found the star dead in bed when he arrived to wake him before a planned Christmas Day lunch. He described Michael as a “beautiful person” and a “kind and generous man”, while Goss said he was devastated by the death. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Singer, songwriter, pop superstar: George Michael dies aged 53 Several days after his late partner’s death, Fawaz shared a link on Twitter to a previously unreleased song by Michael called This Kind Of Love. The song is believed to be from an album that Michael recorded in 1991 with Elton John and other collaborators entitled Trojan Souls, but was never released. He later removed the link, amid reports that lawyers for the late singer’s estate had protested, claiming the star did not want the track released. But in another tweet, Fawaz wrote: Fadi Fawaz (@fadifawaz) The song I posted was found online they are many versions of it, please do your research if u think you r professional in what u do. December 28, 2016 Andrew Ridgeley, Michael’s partner in Wham! and lifelong friend, has said that the musician’s wishes should be respected when it comes to to releasing “lost” songs. “GM controlled all his output. I, nor anyone else have the right to transgress that principle,” he tweeted. Fans have clamoured to buy and download Michael’s music since his death, with six of his albums breaking into the top 100 album chart on Friday, including The Final, his last album with Wham! in 1986, and 2014’s Symphonica. Ladies and Gentlemen, his greatest hits collection, broke the top 10 for the first time in 17 years by re-entering at number eight, with a combined sales and streams surge of more than 5,600%. Wham!’s single Last Christmas reached number seven in the singles chart, returning to the top 10 for the first time in 31 years, while Careless Whisper placed just outside the top 40 at 44. Michael’s duet with Elton John, Don’t Let the Sun Go Down on Me, came in at 91, while Faith hit number 64 and Freedom ‘90 topped the official vinyl singles chart. John played an emotional tribute to Michael this week during a concert in Las Vegas. With a picture of Michael lighting up the backdrop of the stage, he performed Don’t Let the Sun Go Down on Me and said his death was one of the “saddest moments” of his career. He said he knew Michael from the start of Wham! and the two collaborated on music. John also tweeted a photo of the two. Reports this week suggested Michael had left the bulk of his estimated £105m fortune to his older sister Melanie, a hairdresser who travelled with him for much of his career, with his other older sister, Yioda, also sharing in his wealth. The Sun quoted a source as saying: “George was very close to his sisters, and the understanding is that they’re going to inherit most of his wealth, particularly Melanie, who he was incredibly close to.” Other reports suggested Michael’s godchildren were also likely to benefit, including the two children of Shirlie Kemp, his former backing singer while in Wham!, and the children of his cousin Andros. Stories have emerged since Michael’s death of his many acts of discreet generosity, including putting on a free concert for NHS nurses, tipping a hard-up waitress £5,000, and volunteering anonymously at a homeless shelter.

{ "title":"Zero-hours workers '£1,000 worse off a year' than employees", "content": "Workers on zero-hours contracts lose an estimated £1,000 a year compared with employees doing the same work, according to a study that underscores the divide between people in precarious jobs and those who have a permanent contract. The Resolution Foundation said all workers who find themselves without a permanent, full-time role lose out in terms of wages, but people hired on zero-hours contracts suffer the biggest financial punishment. The thinktank said its research showed that workers on zero-hours contracts faced a “precarious pay penalty” compared with other workers doing similar jobs. Fed up with zero-hours contracts and temporary work? Here’s what to do | Steven Parfitt Read more The pay penalty directly associated with zero-hours work amounted to 6.6% or 93p an hour. For a typical zero-hours worker doing 21 hours a week, it amounts to £1,000 a year. An examination of workers in low-paid roles revealed a bigger penalty of 9.5% The foundation said its analysis were the first to pinpoint a specific penalty associated with zero-hours contracts. It said it was well known that zero-hours workers earned less than permanent employees – 38% an hour less on average – but it had previously been assumed this was down to their concentration in low-paying sectors, and younger and less experienced staff. “To get to the real pay penalty associated with zero-hours contracts, the foundation’s analysis compares the pay of zero-hours and non-zero-hours workers with similar characteristics and doing similar jobs,” it said. The Guardian view on employment law: an overhaul is needed | Editorial Read more “It does this by controlling for a wide range of factors including the worker’s gender, age, experience, qualification level, their occupation, the industry they work in and how long they’ve been in their current job. These factors explain around four-fifths of the overall pay gap between zero-hours workers and other employees.” Zero-hours contracts are widely used by retailers such as Sports Direct and JD Sports, restaurants, leisure companies and hotels. The care industry is estimated to employ 160,000 workers on zero-hours contracts while the public sector, especially the health service, has increasingly adopted them. Figures show the number of UK workers on zero-hours contracts rising steadily in recent years, and official data for the last year reveals a leap of 20% to more than 900,000, indicating that insecure employment has become a permanent and growing feature of the jobs market. Laura Gardiner, a senior policy analyst at the Resolution Foundation, said: “Concern about the use and abuse of zero-hours contracts goes far wider than a few notorious firms. There is mounting evidence that their use is associated with a holding down of wages. More than 7m Britons now in precarious employment Read more “While some people value the flexibility offered by zero-hours contracts, they also carry a significant ‘precarious pay penalty’ that can cost workers around £1,000 a year. That’s a big price to pay for work that too often lacks the security workers desire.” The TUC general secretary, Frances O’Grady, said: “Zero-hours workers suffer the double whammy of lower pay and fewer rights at work. That’s why the Taylor review must drag employment law into the 21st century. Far too many workers have no power to stand up to bad bosses.” Earlier this month a report by the thinktank showed that agency workers suffered an average pay penalty of 22p an hour, equivalent to £430 a year for those working full-time. The loss of earnings jumped to 45p an hour for permanent agency workers. A report by the UK’s largest trade union, Unite, estimates that the number of workers in insecure employment of one kind or another has topped 5 million. The government has commissioned a review of modern working practices by Mathew Taylor, the head of the Royal Society of Arts, who said after his appointment that he wanted to put forward reforms that gave workers more control over their lives. In recent months several employers have distanced themselves from the growing disquiet at the overuse of contracts that offer no guarantee of work by offering workers full-time contracts. The pub chain Wetherspoons and Everyman cinemas have said workers will be offered more secure employment.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Man wrongly arrested over Berlin attack says he fears for his life", "content": "Naveed Baloch was crossing a road in central Berlin on the evening of 19 December, having just left a friend’s house. He was halfway over it when, seeing a car heading towards him, he increased his speed. “I then realised it was a police car. I stopped when they beckoned to me, and showed them all the ID I had on me.” They let him go but within seconds had called him back. Before he knew it he was in the back of the car, its lights flashing as it sped through Berlin. His hands were bound behind his back. Later that night, he said, he was blindfolded and taken from “one police station to another place” about 10 minutes away. He recalls two police officers “digging the heels of their shoes into my feet”, and one of the men “putting great pressure on my neck with his hand”. They undressed him and took photographs. “When I resisted, they started slapping me.” They took three samples of his blood. A 24-year-old Pakistani identified only as Naveed B was named by German police and the interior minister, Thomas de Maizière, just hours after the deadly attack on a Christmas market on Berlin’s Breitscheidplatz, as their prime suspect. Speaking exclusively to the Guardian just over a week after being wrongly arrested for the attack which killed 12 and injured 48 others, Baloch is now in hiding, fearful for his life and no longer feeling safe in the country in which he sought refuge as a member of a secular separatist movement in Balochistan, a province that is a frequent target of religious extremists in Pakistan. Members of his family in Pakistan have been contacted by the security services and have been receiving threatening phone calls following the widespread distribution of his photograph and name. “My family and I agree we would be safer if we speak out, and the sooner the better,” he said. On the night he was arrested police brought in a translator who did not speak his native Balochi, but Punjabi and Urdu (the latter he understands a bit though cannot speak it much). Baloch said he was asked whether he knew what had happened in Berlin earlier that evening. “I said I didn’t know, and they told me: ‘Someone took a vehicle and drove it into a crowd killing many people. And you were behind the wheel of that truck, weren’t you?’ “I calmly told them I cannot drive at all. Neither can I even start a vehicle. I told them there’s death and war in my country; that’s why I ran away to seek help. You in Germany are providing us with food, medicine and safety. You are like my mother. If you find I was doing these things to your country, you should not give me an easy death, you should cut me up slowly.” He said he could only assume they understood his answers, though he could not be sure because communication was very awkward. On being questioned further he told them he was a shepherd by profession, that he had arrived from his Balochistan in February this year, and that he was a devout Muslim who prayed five times a day. They balked at his concern over a looming deadline to pay a fine he owed for fare-dodging on Berlin’s transport network days before. “They said to me: ‘You’re worried about paying a fine, when many people have been murdered?’ I told them I just didn’t want to get into trouble.” During his time in custody, he said, they only gave him tea and biscuits. “But I could not eat. The biscuits were disgusting, and the tea was cold.” He slept on a wooden bed without a mattress, his hands bound behind his back on the first night. Having told him already on the night of the attack that they had doubts he was the man they were looking for – not least because there were no traces of blood or injuries on him, despite the bloody struggle that had evidently taken place between the driver and the Polish man from whom the truck had been hijacked – they told him he was free to go. “They explained to me that because I had run across the road when they picked me up, they had reason to believe I might be a criminal. I told them I understood.” By the time Baloch had been told he was off the hook, the police were already looking for Anis Amri, a Tunisian whose documents had been found in the footwell of the Scania truck that had ploughed into the market and who was later shot dead by police officers in Milan. Like Baloch, Amri was 24 and dark-skinned, but there the similarities ended. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Pictures of Anis Amri released by German police. Photograph: HO/AFP/Getty Images After his release Baloch was taken to a hotel and told he was not to leave unless he informed the police, not because he was still under suspicion, but because his life might be in danger, and that he should under no circumstances return to the refugee shelter at the disused airport in the south of Berlin he had been living in. It had been raided by special forces in the early hours of Tuesday 20 December in the search for evidence to link Baloch to the murderous attack on Breitscheidplatz. There his friends waited anxiously and in vain for him to return. Baloch agreed to meet the Guardian this week, above all because he now fears greatly for his safety, and that of his family back in the village of Mand in the Mekran region of Balochistan. He hoped that by telling his story he would be better understood – and safer. He fled the area of arid plains and mountains, a coastal strip of the Arabian Sea in the very south-west of Pakistan, around a year ago because of death threats he said he had received for his political activism on behalf of the Baloch National Movement, which strives for the independence of Balochistan from Pakistan. Balochistan is Pakistan’s largest, most mineral-rich but also poorest province. Located on the border with Afghanistan, it has been dogged by an incessant cycle of violence and underdevelopment since India and Pakistan’s partition on gaining independence in 1947. The Baloch people – numbering around 13 million in Balochistan province – are a unique ethnolinguistic group who have been marginalised throughout history and many of whom desire independence from Pakistan. Baloch, whose application for asylum is currently with the German authorities, is still waiting for a translator of Balochi, the main provincial language, to whom he can give a detailed account of his reason for seeking the legal protection of Germany. “When I get my chance, I will tell them that I have threats to my life in Pakistan, that some of my cousins who also belong to the same political party were killed by the security agencies, who picked them up, murdered them and dumped their bodies. Most of the people I worked with have been arrested and killed. I knew it was a matter of time before they came for me. That’s the reason I came to Germany.” The Guardian cannot verify his account, but it chimes with reports from groups such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch detailing the suppression of Balochistanis by Pakistan’s intelligence agency as well as prominent massacres of Balochistanis for which Islamic State – which has a strong foothold in the province – and other jihadi groups have claimed responsibility. During the two years before he paid human traffickers to smuggle him into Germany, Baloch went on the run, leaving his house one morning at 4am and roaming from village to village across the Mekran district, staying at party workers’ houses for an average of three to five days before moving on to avoid detection by security forces and intelligence. Despite this, he said, he was arrested and tortured by Pakistani forces in Balochistan last year, after which he left for Germany. His three-month journey took him on foot to Iran, then on to Turkey and Greece, before he arrived by train at Munich’s main station in February. It took him three days to realise he was in Germany, a country he knew nothing about, he said. Even now, 10 months on, he knows very little about where he has landed, only that he would like to find work and learn the language. Asked why in particular he chose Germany, Baloch replied: “We found an agent. It was not my choice; it was the traffickers who chose. I paid the agent something upfront, then my family kept paying him in instalments, which we were advised was a better method because so many people had been abandoned on the way, or had lost their lives.” The money was raised, he said, from the proceeds of the sheep and goats of the flock he had tended, which his parents sold once he had fled the village, along with a plot of land. Even then they had to borrow 100,000 of the total fee of 600,000 Pakistani rupees (£4,680, or $5,724). Following his arrest it did not take long for the news to reach his family, via Pakistani media, that the Balochistani in question was their son. “When I was released the first thing I did was to contact them,” Baloch said. “It was my mum who answered, via WhatsApp. She asked me: ‘Did the police torture you?’ I told her no, that I had been caught up in an investigation but that it was over now. Never did she suspect I had done anything wrong, despite the Pakistani media saying – and continuing to say – the German authorities had caught a terrorist from Balochistan.” Much of the reporting continues to say that Baloch has brought the reputation of Pakistan into disrepute, because of German authorities identifying him as a Pakistani and failing to mention Balochistan. Baloch’s non-appearance since his name was cleared has only fuelled speculation – both in Germany and Pakistan – that he might have somehow been involved in the attack after all. He has already been accused of sexual assault, a charge he vehemently denies. He has been told by police in no uncertain terms that his life might be in danger if he returns to his refugee shelter, possibly from Pakistani nationals there who might view him as an enemy of the state, or possibly from German rightwing extremists. He must stay on his own in the secret location provided for him by the police for the next two months, living on meals-on-wheels and having to inform the police every time he steps outside. He is not as concerned for his own safety, he said, as for his family – his parents, four brothers and five sisters – who earn their living from farming. “Before the attack for which I was arrested, no one in Balochistan knew I had disappeared,” he said, dressed in a navy blue hooded sweatshirt, drinking a coffee with a gaunt look in his eyes as he nervously twisted a rolled up cigarette in his hand. “Now they all know I fled to Germany, fearful of my life, and that I am claiming asylum here. It leaves my family very vulnerable and there’s nothing I can do to protect them.” He has been suffering from insomnia since his arrest, and while he is visited by fellow Balochistanis, he said that at night in particular he felt very alone and intensely anxious. “There is no knowing what they might do to my family.” He cited the names of three political activists from his village who had applied for asylum in Germany but returned to Balochistan in May because they feared for their families, who had been threatened in their absence. “The mere fact they had left in the first place made them a focus of suspicion,” Baloch said. “They were picked up by intelligence agents and they are still missing.” The only solace he and around 10 fellow Balochistanis – asylum seekers from around Europe who have joined him in Berlin to give him support – have, he said, is that the incident might help highlight their underreported plight. “In the meantime I just hope that one day they will stop associating my name with that terrible attack,” he said. “Thank goodness they found the man who did it.” • This article was amended on 9 January 2017. An earlier version said Baloch was held for two days and one night. The period is contested; German police say he was held for 23 hours from 9pm on 19 December until about 8pm the following day.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"‘Superstition’ prevents action against children drowning in Bangladesh", "content": "The lives of thousands of children who drown in Bangladesh every year could be saved by encouraging people to put aside superstitions that view the deaths as “God’s will”, a study has found. Drownings have become the leading cause of death in children under the age of 18, numbering around 18,000 a year since 2005, yet such deaths are preventable, according to researchers from the Centre for Injury Prevention and Research, Bangladesh. A £2.5m project, launched in 2016 by the CIPRB, the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) and the George Institute for Global Health, in Sydney, is seeking to challenge these traditional ideas and inform the country’s first nationwide drowning-prevention strategy. The first part of the four-year Bhasa project, which means “rise up” in Bengali, is a household survey of 400,000 people, aimed at providing a detailed picture of drowning deaths, to identify where the worst problems are and where the most effort is needed. The survey, which is backed by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare and the Fire and Civil Defence Service, is based in Barisal, an area by the Kirtankhola river in south-central Bangladesh that the CIPRB believes to be the worst place in the world for drownings of children aged between one and four. There is a perception that drowning is a natural phenomenon, or ‘God’s wish’, and can’t be prevented “In Bangladesh we are investing a lot in vaccinations to prevent measles, in communicable diseases, in preventing pneumonia and diarrhoea. That message has been delivered. But now, we have another mountain to climb,” said Dr Kamran ul Baset, the CIPRB’s associate director. In the past two decades, efforts to tackle childhood infectious diseases have yielded dramatic results in Bangladesh – under-five and infant mortality declined by 65% and 56% respectively between 2004 and 2014 , according to the Bangladesh Demographic and health Survey published this year. Yet, despite drowning being flagged as the leading killer of children between the ages of one and 18 as far back as 2005, little has been done nationwide to tackle it. In 2015, the education ministry issued a circular calling for swimming to be taught in all educational institutions, but this is yet to make a dent in the number of deaths, due to a lack of training facilities. Bangladesh is the most populous delta in Asia, made up of 80% floodplain: water is everywhere, swelling rivers, filling ponds, ditches and deep wells. Travelling from village to village in Barisal, a division known for rice, canals and large rivers, it is not difficult to see why the CIPRB believes it to be the most vulnerable area of the country for young children. At least one deep pond, sometimes several, sit next to each house, and are used for bathing, fishing and swimming. They are rarely fenced off, although some have screens of netting, fabric or plastic, wound around bamboo sticks to provide privacy for bathers. Forty-three per cent of drownings in children under five in Bangladesh happen in ponds, and 80% occur within 20m of the home. Early indications from the Bhasa project have uncovered the biggest hurdle to driving down child deaths in rural parts of the country: a culture that views such deaths as inevitable. Fazlul Kader Chowdhury, a social anthropologist on the project, said: “There is a perception that drowning is a natural phenomenon, or ‘God’s wish’, and can’t be prevented. Every community has a different superstition. Some talk about a ‘devil’ pond and they tell me that when children are there, a bright flower appears which tempts them into deeper water. Others believe there is a fairy God, and that she appears at certain times to lure children in.” Traditional remedies used to try to revive victims make the chances of recovery vanishingly small, said Chowdhury. A child pulled from the water will be spun around on their stomachs, in the belief that the pressure will make them vomit out the water. Another ancient remedy involves putting ash or salt in a child’s mouth, in the perception that it, too, will cause vomiting. It was a pond that three years ago took the life of eight-year-old Limon. His parents, rice farmers from Khanpura village, urged him to learn to swim but he was reluctant and fearful. It was harvest time when he died, a busy time for the family. His mother, Shahanas Ackter, 28, had asked him to bathe at the standpipe, but, instead he went to the pond behind the house, one of three deep ponds around their property, to play. When she went to look for him, she found only his slippers on the steps next to the water. Ackter and her husband, Habibur Rahman, 43, are afraid of losing their second son, Yasin, four, who has nearly drowned three times in his short life. They feel helpless, they said, but are thinking about putting a fence around their house and, when he is old enough, teaching him to swim. After Limon’s death, they fastened an amulet around Yasin’s neck, as is the tradition here, in the hope it would bring him luck and keep him safe. “It is very stressful,” said Ackter. “I try to keep an eye on him, but he is very naughty.” Facebook Twitter Pinterest A child being taught to swim, one of a number of projects being put in place to prevent drownings. Photograph: RNLI Most of the deaths occur in rural areas between 9am and 2pm, when children are most likely to be unsupervised because parents are busy working and doing chores. During harrowing interviews with the parents of children who had drowned, the Guardian found that while the risks are recognised, especially to children too young to swim, many parents felt powerless to take action to reduce those risks. Some said there should be more awareness, but others spoke of the loss of their child to drowning as simply “God’s will”. Local interviewers for the Bhasa survey, who have spoken to people from 40,000 households so far, have also found that in 97% of drownings in Barisal, no one in the area had cardiopulmonary resuscitation training. Many locals believe that if anyone tries CPR and fails to save the life of a person, they are to blame for the death. A number of drowning prevention projects, already piloted by the CIPRB, have seen good results. For example, a community creche to supervise young children while their mothers do the household chores has reduced the drowning risk of those participating by 82%. Another project, to teach older children to swim, has reduced the chance of drowning by 90%. But the CIPRB and the RNLI, which will spend the next few months analysing the data from the Bhasa survey, are keen to develop a strategy based on a bottom-up response to the epidemic. They hope to be in a position to begin implementing prevention measures in June. Helen Morton, head of International advocacy at the RNLI, said: “There’s no ‘one size fits all’ solution for drowning; this survey will give us both the data and the detail on the how, where and why people are losing their lives to the water and, for the first time, the evidence to introduce the right interventions – from community creches and survival swim lessons to ferry regulations and national water safety strategies.”",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Working people need fairer share of economic gains, says TUC head", "content": "Working people in Britain must get a “new bargain” in 2017 that gives them a fairer share of the country’s economic gains and that turns the tide in an increasingly precarious jobs market, the head of the Trades Union Congress has urged. In her new year’s message, Frances O’Grady also pressed the government to ensure workers’ rights are maintained and expanded as the UK prepares to leave the EU, and warned of the threat of “bad bosses” using Brexit to water down rules such as protections from working excessive hours. The TUC general secretary was a vocal supporter of the remain camp during the referendum campaign and championed the EU’s role in guaranteeing many basic rights to workers. She said in Friday’s message: “Unions stand ready to defend these rights and win new rights so we keep pace with both the changing world of work and with our neighbours and competitors in the rest of Europe.” O’Grady warned politicians to draw lessons from 2016, when widespread discontent among voters with ruling elites was seen as a key driver behind the vote for Brexit in the UK, Donald Trump’s win in the US presidential election and the Italian government’s defeat in a key referendum. “2016 will be remembered as the year the establishment was shaken to its core. And yet the political turmoil has not benefited working people. Few feel they have taken back much control over their working lives,” said O’Grady. “So as we look to 2017, it’s clear that we need a new bargain between those at the top – enjoying soaring boardroom pay and insulated from economic change – and ordinary working people. Britain succeeds when working people succeed. And strong unions are the only way to make sure working people get their share in Britain’s success.” Ministers have repeatedly focused on flattering headline measures showing high employment and falling unemployment this year, but the TUC and others have emphasised that a large part of that has been down to a rise in precarious forms of work, including self-employment and people working far fewer hours than they would like. O’Grady wants to see better representation and protection for those workers, including the growing number that are part of the “gig economy” as on-demand services such as Uber and Deliveroo grow. “One in 10 of the UK workforce is now in precarious work. That’s 3.2 million workers in casual or agency work, on a zero-hours contract or in low paid self-employment,” she said. “Just like last century’s dockers standing at the wharf gate hoping for a few hours’ work, the zero-hours contract worker waiting for a text from their boss needs a union. Because if all of those zero-hours contract workers acted together with the protection of a union, the bosses would have to listen – and then, things would change.” Her calls for fairer pay and representation for workers come as labour market experts warn of a tough 2017 for workers, when rising inflation and economic uncertainty could squeeze earnings. One leading employment organisation warned on Friday of slower economic growth, a pick-up in unemployment, fewer new jobs and downward pressure on pay that will compound existing challenges from low productivity and uncertainty about the UK’s future relationship with the EU. In its 2017 outlook, the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD), which represents people working in human resources, predicts real wages will fall in the next 12 months as most employers find they are either unable to or do not need to offer higher wages. Ian Brinkley, the CIPD’s acting chief economist, also predicted that employment practices would continue to change and said the onus was on the government to ensure laws kept pace and workers were treated fairly. “While the gig economy works for many people, we know that, for significant minorities, the experience of work is poor and getting worse,” he said. “We expect the trend of flexible or ‘atypical’ employment practices – through agency work, zero-hours and self-employment – to continue. How to manage, train and progress an increasingly arms-length part of the workforce will remain a major and growing challenge for organisations and the HR profession in particular.” The group also highlighted the UK’s lacklustre productivity performance, something the chancellor, Philip Hammond, has vowed to address with a £23bn spending plan. The CIPD said it was vital the scheme was expanded to include measures to improve skills. “Equally, the government’s new industrial strategy for 2017 should focus much more strongly on the workplace and skills, with the single aim of improving productivity,” added Brinkley.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Why Russia-brokered Syrian ceasefire has chance of succeeding", "content": "Labelled an international pariah only months ago by Boris Johnson, and warned he would be stuck in a Syrian quagmire by a patronising Barack Obama, Vladimir Putin ends 2016 if not as the undisputed victor, then at least as the man at the centre of decision making. It is Moscow and not Washington that is calling the shots in the Middle East. Reeling from its cold war defeat and the subsequent collapse of the Soviet empire, Moscow was unable to save Yugoslavia from what it termed western aggression. Syrian government and rebels have signed ceasefire deal, says Putin Read more But in the case of Syria, it can claim it has recovered its self-respect. In the process, it has built a brutal reputation for sticking by its friends, understanding the dynamics of the region better than America, and knowing how to use military power to forge diplomatic alliances. The US, by contrast, ends 2016 out in the cold, holding a postmortem into the failure of its peace drive with Israel. Many will rightly warn that experience in Syria shows ceasefires are fragile and do not lead to peace talks, let alone peace deals. But the unlikely Russian-Turkish peace drive has a propitious backdrop. No single formula or manual exists for ending a civil war. But a sense of futility born of exhaustion, a decisive change in the military balance, a recasting of the key actors and a shift in the diplomatic alliances are all key ingredients, and in the case of the Syrian civil war all four factors exist. After five years, hundreds of thousands of civilian deaths and the displacement of millions, the Syrian people have experienced the deepest depth of despair. Whatever democratic hopes led to the rebellion, those dreams seem further away than ever. Areas of control in Syria The military intervention of Russia a year ago saved President Bashar al-Assad’s regime, and this month led to the defeat of the rebels in east Aleppo, changing the military balance for good. Hillary Clinton’s failure to be elected president extinguished the final hope that a more interventionist, strong anti-Russian voice would be heard in the White House. Donald Trump may be an unknown quantity, but given the choice he will back Assad, and not the Saudi-supported rebels. Finally, Assad’s greatest external opponent, Turkey, has for a mixture of reasons – some noble and some self-interested – decided to make its peace with Putin. It leaves the divided rebels forced back on their own resources, and the Gulf states. Saudi Arabia has discovered for itself in Yemen the price of war, and will not intervene militarily in Syria without US involvement. Russia is welcoming diplomatic and economic overtures from traditional US allies in the region. Qatar has invested in a $11.5bn deal for a 19.5% stake in Rosneft, Russia’s largest oil producer, even though the company is subject to US and EU sanctions. Eygpt also appears to be close to a new beginning with Moscow. So some of the old road blocks to peace are disappearing. But that does not mean all is now plain sailing for Russia. Ending Syria’s multilayered war makes solving a Rubik’s cube look as simple as the most mundane game of noughts and crosses. For a start Turkey still insists Assad will have to stand down as part of the peace process, the issue that led to previous peace talks to founder. So Putin will have to find a formula that eluded the UN’s Syrian peace envoy, Staffan de Mistura, which allows the talks to start with the issue of Assad’s future in effect parked. The identity of the rebels to be invited to the peace talks will also have to be agreed. That will require Assad to abandon his division of Syria into loyalists and terrorists, requiring Putin to force Assad to accept that he will have to negotiate with rebels that are not linked to Islamic State or Jabhat Fatah al-Sham, formerly known as al-Nusra Front, which is linked to al-Qaida. US officials believe it is nigh impossible to separate al-Nusra from mainstream rebels. Putin will also struggle to ensure that Iranians feel they have gained sufficient spoils from victory. Figures cited by Charles Lister, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute, suggested Iran had a position of influence over 30,000 Shia militias in Syria. Facebook Twitter Pinterest A woman carries a child as she walks near rubble of damaged buildings in al-Rai town, northern Aleppo. Photograph: Khalil Ashawi/Reuters “An inconvenient fact for an Obama administration determined to retain the Iran deal’s implementation has been that wherever the Assad regime has gained in Syria, the Iranians have invariably been leading the charge,” Lister has written. “And with Assad now firmly in place in Damascus, Tehran enjoys overwhelming influence in Iraq, Syria and Lebanon, with substantial sway in parts of Yemen and the Palestinian territories.” Iran is already saying its arch-enemy, Saudi Arabia, must not be present at the talks. Turkey looks like the pivotal state. The US also appears to be in the process of mislaying this vital ally, but it is hard to read how much Ankara will compromise to strike a deal. Essentially Putin offered Turkey’s president a bargain. In return for allowing the Syrian army to capture Aleppo, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan looks to have been given the opportunity in northern Syria to push back against a Syrian Kurdish federation, his key concern, even though the US-backed Syrian Kurds have been at the forefront of the fight against Islamic State in Raqqa. The Kurds were excluded from the UN Geneva peace process, and Putin’s initial peace talks due to take place in Astana, the capital of Kazakhstan, may also leave the Kurds without a seat at the negotiating table. If so, the Kurds, another bloodied US ally, will feel that the professorial Obama proved to be a lot better at lecturing on the state of the world than actually shaping it.

{ "title":"After 130 years of obscurity, Myanmar's forgotten royals make a comeback", "content": "Soe Win has never lived in a palace or held court, and his previous job was managing Myanmar’s under-19s football team. “Sometimes we forget that we are royal family members,” said the great-grandson to the country’s last king, Thibaw, who has spent his life as the heir to the millennium-old Burmese monarchy. In a democratic Myanmar, the royal family – nearly lost after Thibaw was dethroned in the 19th century – think it might finally be time for a revival. The election of Aung San Suu Kyi a year ago ended more than a century of autocratic rule, by British imperialists and then Burmese army generals who saw royal descendants as a threat. ‘It will blow up’: fears Myanmar's deadly crackdown on Muslims will spiral out of control Read more “From when the British took over, we lost our identity,” Soe Win said. “Nowadays, the country is changing, we have some space. Our royal family members would like to be part of developing the country.” He is not considering a royal takeover. Soe Win has more modest goals: to see the country’s regal history acknowledged and discussed; the holding of royal ceremonies; and perhaps the restoration of the Golden Palace in Mandalay, destroyed by the British during the second world war and now mostly serving as a dusty barracks. His most immediate aim is to bring home King Thibaw’s body from the tiny port city of Ratnagiri in India, where the most powerful man in Burma was banished by the British in 1885. This month, Soe Win made a trip to the tomb with the head of the Myanmar armed forces, Min Aung Hlaing, who laid wreaths at the humble grave. “This tomb not only belongs to the royal family, it belongs to the country. The country lost the king and queen, the heads of state,” said Soe Win. The official visit to India was the latest of various governmental nods of approval towards royal activities starting in 2012 when Thein Sein, the last army-linked president, visited Ratnagiri. And in November, 131 years after Thibaw entered exile, about 100 royal descendants were allowed into Mandalay palace to commemorate the end of the king’s reign. Previous ceremonies were held in secret. Alex Bescoby (@AlexBescoby) The man who would be... For first time in history Burma's royal family remember Last King's exile - inside Mandalay palace. #lostroyals pic.twitter.com/iwqO5sQB3k November 26, 2016 Only now, Myanmar’s people are learning about their royal past. “Thibaw’s government was one of the best educated the country ever had, with many scholars returned from studies in Europe, fluent in the Burmese classics as well as English and French,” said the historian Thant Myint-U. Yet the British wanted complete control. They were shocked at the king’s proclamations for independence and had tired of his requests that they remove their shoes during royal visits. A day after taking Mandalay, the British escorted the king and his wife away on a bullock cart. To crush any residual affinity for the monarchy, British propaganda against Thibaw “went into high gear”, said Thant Mtint-U, painting the monarch as an ogre, despot and drunkard. “Unfortunately, a lot of these myths about the king – that he was a uniquely weak individual, that he was someone who was not up to the task of government – are things that have seeped into the popular imagination in this country.” Soe Win’s family were allowed to return after Thibaw’s death in 1916 but were stripped of their titles and lived under house arrest as well as “the watchful eyes of the [British] district commissioners”. His grandmother, the youngest of Thibaw’s four daughters, made claims to the kingdom in 1930 and was branded by the British as a “rebel princess”. She was forced to live in a small town in the country’s deep south. Soe Win’s father, also an heir as the eldest grandson and nicknamed “Prince George” at school, was shot dead under mysterious circumstances in 1948, the same year the country, then called Burma, gained its independence. “The British came and ended our history,” Soe Win said. After the military seized power in 1962, they hid members of the family from public view, worried that nostalgia for the royals might threaten the army’s tight hold on the country. British film-maker Alex Bescoby, who has been making the documentary Burma’s Lost Royals, said the military took on the symbols of royalty while also trying to sideline the family. “They wanted to have royalism without the royals,” Bescoby said. Naypyidaw, the grand but empty capital Myanmar’s generals built for themselves, means “abode of kings”, a hint at their aspirations. Facebook Twitter Pinterest The tomb of the last queen of Burma, Supayalat, in Yangon, Myanmar The country’s first dictator, General Ne Win, even went so far as to marry a member of the royal family in an attempt to exploit domestic affection for the monarchy. But she left him after five months. For the past few decades, the family, dispersed across Myanmar and the world, have lived muted lives. Soe Win’s uncle, Taw Phaya, a 93-year-old potential heir, and aunt, Hteik Su Phaya Gyi, 94, are the only surviving grandchildren. But it was through working with Bescoby on the film, Soe Win says, that he started to believe he might be able to reignite a passion for the country’s royal history. “We realised that we have to get back our identity, not just for the royal family but the whole country,” he said. After running out of money this year, Bescoby won a £80,000 award from the Whicker’s World Foundation in June, enough to help organise the trip to India this month. “Soe Win has had a massive personal renaissance,” said Bescoby, a former Burmese history student who now lives between the UK and Myanmar. “He is adamant that before he dies, he wants to revive interest in the family, to get Thibaw’s reputation revised.”",diasaster:0},

Children spend most of their lives at home, so the design of residential neighbourhoods is particularly crucial. Our research into how residents use external spaces near their homes reveals that where children play out for longer, independently, there is more social use by the rest of the community. Yet policy and practice do not work with us to achieve well-designed places for people to live in this way. As an architectural practice we know this first hand, we battle against car parking, space standards and myriad other regulations. However our research underpins our conviction and we are now focusing on the benefits of designing for independent mobility and play as a positive way to start to tackle the issue.

Screens might come along too, just don’t tell the parents. Dinah Bornat ZCD Architects and University of East London Screen-based lifestyle harms children’s health | Letters Read more • Your correspondent (Letters, 29 December) misses the point about our letter on children’s wellbeing. As a literacy specialist, I’d be worried if the under-sevens were spending as much time on solitary, sedentary “paper-based technology” as they spend today on the screen-based variety. However, there’s no danger of that, because they aren’t fluent readers or writers. Screen-based entertainment, on the other hand, is readily accessible from soon after birth, and steadily displacing activities that are vital for children’s physical, emotional, social and cognitive development. A key factor in healthy all-round development during early childhood is active, creative, social play, with parents/carers and with other children. It’s particularly important that, from the age of two or three, children play outdoors with their peers, preferably in natural environments. This sort of activity is increasingly difficult for parents to provide, which helps explain their growing reliance on technological alternatives. This is why our letter called for a kindergarten stage for children aged 3-7, focusing on social and emotional development and outdoor play, and for national guidelines on screen use for the under-12s. I helped to organise the letter because I believe both of these are now necessary if our children are to be adequately prepared not only for literacy, but for learning and life in general.

Based partly on the Reggio Emilia model in Italy and the pioneering work of organisations such as Learning Through Landscapes, those purpose-designed kindergartens were exemplary in recognising that the environment is central to the success of any early years programme, particularly one which is based on self-directed outdoor play.

But bush-walks, long river swims and jumping she seems to find fun. “I have always loved jumping, I always wanted to do show-jumping on a horse,” said Simpson. “And Lilac was always jumping out of the cow shed when she was young so I think she likes it, too. We started her off with stepping over logs and it just got bigger and bigger.” Simpson tried Lilac with a horse saddle once but she didn’t take to it, so now she rides bareback with a halter and a small stick to give the old girl a nudge when she needs it. She said Lilac had bucked her off “countless times” ever since Simpson first climbed up.

And I don’t need to compete. She is more special than a horse, more rare.” Simpson, who works on a Southland dairy farm, has attempted to ride other cows, though without much success. Lilac, she said, was undoubtedly “special”. Two years ago Simpson got a horse – Sammy – but she still prefers to ride her cow.

{ "title":"Iain Wright, the MP bringing Mike Ashley and Sir Philip Green to book", "content": "“Do I have to have a beer with either of them?” asks Iain Wright, the chairman of the Commons’ business select committee, when quizzed about which, of the two billionaires he interrogated during 2016, he would choose to meet for a Christmas pint. “Do you know what? I think Mike Ashley would like a pint more than [Sir] Philip Green,” the Labour MP for Hartlepool says. “I don’t think Philip Green would want a pint. I think he’d probably want an extraordinarily expensive bottle of champagne ... and then he’d get me to pay for it.” The quote just about sums up the year Wright has experienced at the centre of two separate scandals that engulfed a pair of Britain’s best known and wealthiest retailers. There are parts of his statement that appear conciliatory, but then plenty more that would irk both tycoons who, according to Wright, have come to encapsulate the corporate excess that may have contributed to the country voting to leave the European Union. Ashley was hauled in front of Wright’s business committee over working conditions at his sportswear chain Sports Direct, in the wake of a Guardian investigation that showed the company’s warehouse workers were being paid less than the national minimum wage. Business people have been dragged in front of MPs for much less, yet Ashley’s appearance did not happen without a fight. The billionaire owner of Newcastle United football club initially refused to attend, despite Wright’s committee taking the unusual step of issuing him with a formal summons and then threatening to find him in contempt of parliament – an ancient offence which theoretically is punishable by imprisonment. But parliament’s powers are so archaic that they may no longer be practically enforceable, meaning it was always unclear what could be done to Ashley if he failed to show – a move that would have put the whole select committee system on trial. At that moment, there must have been a lot of pressure on Wright? Facebook Twitter Pinterest Sir Philip Green gives evidence to the business committee hearing. Photograph: PA “I didn’t feel any pressure at all,” he claims. “Maybe I should have. I felt it was a point of principle. Nobody’s bigger than parliament – I felt so strongly about that and I was keen to go to the wire ... You don’t refuse to come to a select committee – you just don’t. “If necessary I would have been pushing to change the law to make sure it was a legal requirement to attend,” Wright adds. “You’ve seen with the likes of Margaret Hodge [the former chair of the public accounts committee] ... fantastic work [has been done by] the select committee. And all of that could have been put under threat if people think they don’t have to go.” In the end, Ashley not only backed down but also made a string of admissions under the committee’s questioning, including acknowledging that Sports Direct had broken the law by not paying the minimum wage and confessing that he is struggling to control the company he founded and in which he still owns a majority stake. Wright’s committee responded with a report accusing Ashley of running Sports Direct like a Victorian workhouse and building his success on a business model that treats workers “without dignity or respect”. A selection of the committee’s MPs then showed up at the firm’s controversial warehouse in Shirebrook, Derbyshire, for an impromptu inspection, which memorably ended with Wright accusing the company of secretly recording his group during a private meeting. “I’m still keen to work with him,” Wright insists. “I think the recording device suggests a real level of distrust.” The same might be said of the parliamentarian’s relationship with Green. The retail knight was questioned over the collapse of BHS and the £571m shortfall in its pension fund by a joint parliamentary committee, made up of Wright’s committee plus the work and pensions committee, led by Frank Field. While Wright, a former accountant, pulls very few punches, there is still an obvious contrast in style with Field, the veteran Labour MP who went on radio to compare Green with the pension plunderer Robert Maxwell. Green was furious with Field – and remains so – and the MP’s lawyers apparently had to provide an assurance he had not meant to accuse Green of theft. But was the soundbite part of an agreed strategy, or did it come as a surprise to Wright? “He’d mentioned it privately to me, yeah,” Wright says. “He’ll understand what went on in the early 90s with Maxwell. I can see similarities in terms [of a ] corporate governance element. Frank’s entitled to say what he likes. There was an element of different styles, an element of different personalities coming to the fore, but we were definitely speaking all together.” If Wright was pleased with how his report on Sports Direct came out, he was even more proud of the BHS one co-written with Field, which found that the department store had been subjected to “systematic plunder” by former owners including Green, who gave “insufficient priority” to the BHS pension scheme that slumped to a £571m deficit. Wright described the 60-page document as “my Sgt Pepper”. So, who was John and who was Paul? “One of the great thing about the Beatles – and you can hear it in Abbey Road particularly – is the harmonies and I think the way we harmonised together was really strong,” Wright says. “We worked as one team, we left our committee badges at the door, we left our party affiliation at the door and we just worked to see what on earth went wrong here and how we try to mitigate that.” Facebook Twitter Pinterest Sports Direct founder Mike Ashley gives evidence to the business select committee. Photograph: Reuters He eventually settles on Field as Lennon, while also lauding a pair of Conservative MPs – Jeremy Quin from the pensions committee and Richard Fuller from Wright’s own business committee – for their contributions. Even so, the two inquiries have had different outcomes. While the Sports Direct saga eventually produced some benefit for the poorly paid workers, when the £1m backpay deal was unveiled in August, Wright still seems to view the company’s efforts as a work in progress. Meanwhile, the BHS pension scandal rumbles on into 2017, with Green still promising to “sort” the deficit and the pension regulator launching formal legal proceedings in November against Green and Dominic Chappell, the businessman he sold BHS to for £1. Given the different outcomes, it would be good to know if Wright sees his Christmas pint glass as half empty or half full.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Debbie Reynolds obituary", "content": "When Debbie Reynolds, wearing a skimpy pink flapper’s dress, burst out of an enormous cake at a Hollywood party in Singin’ in the Rain (1952), she simultaneously burst into screen stardom. In fact, it was the sixth film appearance of Reynolds, who has died aged 84, but her first starring role. The casting of the inexperienced 19-year-old was a risk taken by Gene Kelly and Stanley Donen, the co-directors of the classic MGM musical about the early days of talkies. The gamble paid off, but not without some sweat and strain. Debbie Reynolds: her life and career – in pictures Read more “There were times when Debbie was more interested in playing the French horn somewhere in the San Fernando Valley or attending a Girl Scout meeting,” Kelly recalled. “She didn’t realise she was a movie star all of a sudden.” Reynolds herself admitted later: “I was so confused. It seemed dumb to me ... reporting to the studio at 6am, six days a week and shooting till midnight. I didn’t know anything about show business. “I learned a lot from Gene,” she added. “He is a perfectionist and a disciplinarian – the most exacting director I’ve ever worked for … Every so often, he would yell at me and make me cry. But it took a lot of patience for him to work with someone who had never danced before. It’s amazing that I could keep up with him and Donald O’Connor. This little girl from Burbank sure had a lot of spirit.” Daughter of Maxene (nee Harmon) and Ray Reynolds, she was born Mary Frances Reynolds in El Paso, Texas. Her father was a railroad mechanic and carpenter, who lost his job at the height of the Great Depression. After living from hand to mouth for a while, the family moved to Burbank, California when her father got a job with the Southern Pacific railroad. While at high school, Reynolds entered and won the Miss Burbank beauty contest. One of the requirements was “talent”, which she fulfilled by lip-syncing to a record of Betty Hutton singing I’m a Square in the Social Circle, which earned her a Warner Bros contract. (It was Jack Warner who gave her the name of Debbie.) But after a bit part in the Bette Davis comedy June Bride (1948), and playing June Haver’s bubbly young sister in The Daughter of Rosie O’Grady (1950), she took up a contract with MGM, where she flourished, on and off, throughout the 50s and early 60s. Prior to Singin’ in the Rain, Reynolds was noticed, in what amounted to a cameo, lip-syncing I Wanna Be Loved By You to the singer Helen Kane’s voice in Three Little Words (1950). In Two Weeks with Love (1950), as a younger sister again, this time Jane Powell’s, the cute 5 ft 2in Reynolds stopped the show with the 6ft 3in Carleton Carpenter in two numbers: Abba Dabba Honeymoon and Row, Row, Row, with her nifty tap dancing belying her statements of never having danced before Singin’ in the Rain. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Video: Debbie Reynolds, Gene Kelly and Donald O’Connor perform Good Mornin’ in Singin’ in the Rain, 1952 Reynolds’s lively opening Charleston number in her breakthrough film has her singing and dancing All I Do Is Dream of You with a dozen other chorus girls; she keeps up brilliantly with Kelly and O’Connor in the cheery matinal greeting Good Mornin’, danced and sung around a living room – even though during some of the more challenging steps, she stands by and lets the two men dance around her – and she is touching in the lyrical duet You Were Meant For Me with Kelly, who switches on coloured lights and a gentle wind machine on a sound stage to create a make-believe atmosphere. In the plot, a silent screen star, Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen, unforgettable), has a risibly squeaky voice for sound movies and, unknown to the public, is dubbed by Kathy Selden (Reynolds). In reality, however, Debbie’s singing voice was dubbed by the uncredited Betty Noyes, and Hagen herself provided the speaking voice for Debbie, dubbing her on screen because Reynolds was then handicapped by what Donen called “that terrible western noise”. An effervescent Reynolds went on to star in a series of charming youthful musicals, this time using her own pleasant singing voice. I Love Melvin (1953) was one of the best, with Reynolds paired again with O’Connor. The film opens with A Lady Loves, a musical dream sequence in which Debbie sees herself as a big movie star courted by Robert Taylor. This gives her a chance to be classy, in a tongue-in-cheek manner. Later she features in a witty acrobatic number entitled Saturday Afternoon Before the Game in which she is dressed as a ball being tossed around by a football team. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Debbie Reynolds and Eddie Fisher cutting their wedding cake, 1955. Photograph: Everett/Rex/Shutterstock There followed The Affairs of Dobie Gillis, Give a Girl a Break (both 1953), Susan Slept Here, Athena (both 1954), Hit the Deck and The Tender Trap (both 1955). In the latter, a romantic comedy, Frank Sinatra is a confirmed bachelor and Reynolds is determined to trap him into marriage. In the same year, 23-year-old Reynolds married the 27-year-old crooner Eddie Fisher. They became the darlings of the fan magazines, and co-starred in Bundle of Joy (1956), a feeble musical remake of the 1939 Ginger Rogers-David Niven comedy, which capitalised on their personalities as a happy young couple and the rumours of her pregnancy. (Reynolds gave birth to a daughter, Carrie, in October 1956.) Meanwhile with the film musical in a moribund state, Reynolds showed that she could get by in straight acting roles, the first proof being in The Catered Affair (1956), a slice of Hollywood realism, with Reynolds as the daughter of working-class parents (Bette Davis and Ernest Borgnine). This failed at the box office, unlike Tammy and the Bachelor (1957), which was one of Reynolds’s greatest successes, the theme song of which (“I hear the cottonwoods whisp’rin’ above, Tammy! Tammy! Tammy’s in love!”) remained high in the hit parade for months. This entertaining piece of whimsy gave Reynolds, as a backwoods girl in love with a wealthy man (Leslie Nielsen), what was an archetypal role – a naive girl thrust into a sophisticated world … and triumphing. Debbie Reynolds and Carrie Fisher – in pictures Read more In 1957, Eddie and Debbie were best man and matron of honour at the wedding in Acapulco of Fisher’s lifelong friend the impresario Mike Todd to Elizabeth Taylor. A little over a year later, Todd was killed in a plane crash, and Taylor sought solace in Fisher’s arms, causing a huge Hollywood scandal. Taylor, who had been cast as the Grieving Widow, now found herself in the role of the Vamp, while Reynolds was widely and sympathetically portrayed as the Wronged Woman. However, the outraged moralistic public was unaware that the Fisher-Reynolds marriage was already in tatters, although they continued to play America’s sweethearts in public, mainly because Debbie was pregnant with their son Todd (named after Mike) and they were worried that divorce would damage their popularity ratings. But divorce was inevitable and, on 12 May 1959, Taylor, who had converted to Judaism when she married Todd, married Fisher at a synagogue in Las Vegas. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Debbie Reynolds and Gene Kelly in a publicity shot for Singin’ in the Rain, 1952. Photograph: Allstar/MGM Despite being the divorced mother of two small children, Reynolds was never more active. In 1959, she was among the top 10 Hollywood box-office stars and appeared four movies that year: The Mating Game, Say One for Me, The Gazebo and It Started With a Kiss. None were world-beaters, but they got by on her effortless charm. In November 1960, Reynolds married the millionaire shoe-store magnate Harry Karl, and pursued her career with added vigour, though her roles hardly varied, whether she was playing Fred Astaire’s nubile daughter in The Pleasure of His Company or a feisty young widow with two children in The Second Time Around (both 1961) or a pioneer woman in the sprawling Cinerama western How the West Was Won (1962), in which she is the only character who makes it through from the first reel to the last, ageing from 16 to 90. In The Unsinkable Molly Brown (1964), for which she was Oscar-nominated, Reynolds throws herself around energetically in the title role of the backwoods girl (shades of Tammy, but with added robustness) who enters high society and survives the Titanic, displaying everything she had learned from past musicals, especially in the dance numbers Belly Up to the Bar, Boys and I Ain’t Down Yet. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Debbie Reynolds and Harve Presnell in The Unsinkable Molly Brown, 1964. Photograph: Everett/Rex/Shutterstock After playing a man resurrected as a woman in the tiresome Goodbye Charlie (1964), and the title role in The Singing Nun (1966), the mawkish biopic of the guitar-strumming Belgian nun who composed the hit song Dominique, she finally managed to bid farewell to her ingenue “tomboy” persona and portray a mature adult in Divorce American Style (1967). A rare Hollywood comedy with teeth, it cast Reynolds and Dick Van Dyke against type as a squabbling couple, who utter not a word as they prepare for bed in the best sequence. “That was a really hard part to get,” Reynolds commented. “The producer didn’t want me. He didn’t think I could play an ordinary married woman. I think he thought I had to be all ‘diva’d up’ and in a musical.” When Reynolds, now in her mid-30s, saw her film career gradually slowing to a virtual halt, she reinvented herself as a cabaret performer, appearing most frequently on stage in Las Vegas. Reynolds also shifted her attention to US television starting with 18 episodes of The Debbie Reynolds Show (1969-70), a sitcom resembling I Love Lucy, in which she played a suburban housewife with ambitions to become a newspaper reporter. She continued to appear regularly on TV for the next four decades. What’s the Matter With Helen? (1971), a campy murder tale set in 1930s Hollywood in which Reynolds and Shelley Winters run a school for budding Shirley Temples, would be her last feature film for 20 years. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Debbie Reynolds receives a lifetime achievement award from her daughter, Carrie Fisher, at the Screen Actors Guild awards, Los Angeles, 2015. Photograph: Rex/Shutterstock By the early 1970s, her marriage to Karl was heading for the rocks, mainly because of his infidelities but also because he had gambled away both their fortunes. Luckily, Reynolds was still bankable and, immediately after her divorce in 1973, she made her Broadway debut in a revival of the 1919 musical hit Irene. The show, which ran for 18 months, gained Reynolds a Tony nomination, and was the first of several stage musicals she would appear in over the years: Annie Get Your Gun, The Unsinkable Molly Brown and Woman of the Year among them. Reynolds returned to the big screen in the 90s, where she showed that she had lost none of her comic timing playing a number of sweet-voiced monster mums, having maintained her doll-like looks. These included Albert Brooks’s Mother (1996), her first leading film role for 27 years, In & Out (1997) and Zack and Reba (1998), as well as appearing in 10 episodes of Will and Grace on TV, portraying Grace’s mother, a would-be star whose propensity for breaking out into show tunes and impressions dismays her daughter. Reynolds was also known as Princess Leia’s mother, after Carrie Fisher found fame in the Star Wars movies. Aside from performing, Reynolds had many other interests. In 1991, she bought a hotel and casino in Las Vegas, where she displayed part of her extensive collection of vintage Hollywood props, sets and costumes. But after her marriage to the real-estate developer Richard Hamlett ended in 1996, she was forced to declare bankruptcy the following year. She later reopened her museum in Hollywood. Reynolds was also an indefatigable fund-raiser for The Thalians (a charitable organisation that provides mental health services from pediatrics to geriatrics in Los Angeles). Carrie Fisher died the day before her mother, after a suspected heart attack on a flight from London to Los Angeles. Reynolds is survived by her son, Todd.

{ "title":"Amazon plans for giant airship warehouses revealed", "content": "Amazon has filed a patent for flying warehouses that could use a fleet of drones to make deliveries to customers. A patent document filed in 2014 in the US describes giant airships as “airborne fulfilment centres” (AFCs) that could be stationed above metropolitan areas and used to store and quickly deliver items at times of high demand, using drones dispatched directly from the airship. The technology and e-commerce giant is already testing drone deliveries in the UK, and made its first commercial delivery under the trial in Cambridgeshire this month. The patent filing also suggests smaller aircraft and other unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) could ferry workers to and from the ship as well as replenish stock. Are drone deliveries a realistic prospect? Read more “The AFC may be an airship that remains at a high altitude (eg 45,000ft) and UAVs with ordered items may be deployed from the AFC to deliver ordered items to user-designated delivery locations,” the filing reads. “As the UAVs descend, they can navigate horizontally toward a user-specified delivery location using little to no power, other than to stabilise the UAV and/or guide the direction of descent. Shuttles (smaller airships) may be used to replenish the AFC with inventory, UAVs, supplies, fuel, etc. Likewise, the shuttles may be utilised to transport workers to and from the AFC.” Many firms experimenting with drone technology have had difficulty increasing the range of the craft, which can be restricted by the size and weight of the battery. Amazon’s UK drone trial is limited to items weighing 5lb or less that can be delivered within 30 minutes. Amazon’s patent filing suggests the unfixed position of an airborne warehouse could be used to meet demand in different areas as needed, as well as reduce delivery times. The documents suggest that in some instances airships could be moved close to sporting arenas or festival sites and used to sell merchandise. Amazon has not commented on the filing.",diasaster:0},

{ "title":"Sherlock's future in doubt as stars' Hollywood schedules fill", "content": "The growing Hollywood success of Sherlock stars Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman could mean that the next series, which begins on Sunday night, is the last to be filmed. Mark Gatiss, the co-creator of the BBC1 hit drama, said that while everybody involved was keen to record more episodes, the difficulty of scheduling the actors’ time was one of a number of factors meaning that future seasons were in doubt. “We would love to do more, but we are not lying, we absolutely don’t know,” Gatiss told journalists and fans at a screening of the first episode of the new series. “It’s up to all kinds of factors, scheduling. Willingness to do it is all all here, but we are just not sure.” Facebook Twitter Pinterest Watch Sherlock Holmes return in New Year’s Day episode trailer Cumberbatch played the hero in Marvel’s Doctor Strange earlier this year, and the character is slated to appear in at least two more films in the Marvel superhero series, Thor: Ragnorak and Avengers: Infinity War. Freeman has also become a global star since being cast in the first series in 2010, having played Bilbo Baggins in The Hobbit films. Gatiss and co-creator Steven Moffat also have other commitments, including their work on Doctor Who, of which Moffat is the current showrunner. Speaking at the screening, Cumberbatch suggested Sherlock would go through more of an emotional evolution than in previous series, becoming “less of a dick” in the process. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Cumberbatch on the set of Sherlock. Photograph: BBC/Hartswood Films/PA “He’s becoming slightly more, in a very clear way, responsible for his actions. I think he understands that it’s a slow, slow process that began with the very first instance when he met John [Watson], when you needed [that] missing part.” “That friendship, that partnership in crime, that has been a humanising element all the way through all three series. I think he’s very much becoming more of a human being.” He joked that show’s strapline should be: “Sherlock, coming back to you on BBC1 as slightly less of a dick, starring slightly-less-of-a-dick Benedict Cumberbatch.” Freeman, meanwhile, said Watson would appear this time with more “shades of grey”. Offering up something of an explanation, Moffat added: “Dr Watson becomes slightly more of a dick.” To complicate the picture, it emerged that Freeman has recently separated from his partner, Amanda Abbington who plays Watson’s wife, Mary, in the programme. Sherlock has had his exile for murder abruptly curtailed after messages from vanquished foe Moriarty appear across TV screens, advertising hoardings, and social media, seemingly from beyond the grave. The series, which also stars Toby Jones as new nemesis Culverton Smith, has been billed as the darkest yet. The team behind Sherlock have been at pains to avoid spoilers for the latest series, which begins where the special episode last January left off with the first instalment, Six Thatchers. The first episode is loosely based on the original Arthur Conan Doyle story The Six Napoleons and sees busts of Margaret Thatcher smashed in search of important clues. Gatiss, who has said he based his performance as Sherlock’s brother, Mycroft, on Labour’s Peter Mandelson, said the choice of the former Conservative prime minister was not particularly political, but rather an updating of the story to the modern era where Sherlock is set. Beryl Vertue: 'Sherlock is a family affair' Read more “It’s a simple equivalence: we’ve modernised it. And with this one, we needed someone who was iconic ... she’s become like Napoleon.” Moffat also revealed that an uncooperative bloodhound had led to a hasty rewrite during filming. “The big challenge was that beautiful dog,” he said. “It didn’t move. That was an immobile dog. Me and Mark [Gatiss] wrote that one [scene] on the street to account for the fact it wouldn’t bloody move.” Gatiss added: “Having had years of terrible experience with animals, the people who tell you they train animals are liars. I imagine giraffes and all kinds of things, but it’s a dog, we basically got there with this bloodhound and she … it wouldn’t do a thing.” Last year’s New Year’s Day episode of Sherlock, in which Holmes and Watson were transported to the Victorian setting of Doyle’s original books, was one of the most watched programmes of 2016, with 11.6 million viewers.

Providing it chooses a candidate in the Reed template – which means a pro-nuclear local candidate backed by the GMB union – and also that it fights the contest hard, then a seat dominated by the Sellafield plant may prove a tough nut for the Tories to crack. Copeland may be made of more dogged Labour stuff than London-based pundits who have never been to Cleator Moor or Egremont may assume. Providing Ukip does not withdraw to give the Tories a clear run, my money would still be on Labour at this stage. But Copeland and other recent byelections have rekindled a wider debate about UK party politics and election strategies. The matter in question is whether the parties of the left of centre, loosely defined, should be more open to electoral and political cooperation of various kinds in order to prevent the Tories re-establishing a rightwing English-based post-Brexit hegemony over British politics for the foreseeable future. For the reasons just stated, Copeland may not be a particularly good test bed for this “progressive alliance” thinking. Although the Liberal Democrats and the Greens ran candidates against Reed in 2010 and 2015, their voters are likely to be anti-nuclear. So there is little prospect of them backing a Labour candidate whose central pitch is likely to be the defence of Sellafield and the thousands of relatively well-paid jobs it generates. For the same reason, Labour has no incentive to court these voters.

At its core are three propositions. The first is that the majority of people in the UK do not vote Conservative, so the non-Tory parties need to cooperate more. The second is that Labour’s historic late 20th-century dominance over the UK’s non-Tory party politics is in decline, so these forces need to cooperate if they are not to be endlessly eclipsed by the Tories. The third is that Britain needs a new 21st-century, post-industrial progressive agenda that takes more account of factors including inequality, localism and climate change. No one who writes professionally for the Guardian can dismiss any part of this. More than 100 years ago, this paper’s owner and editor CP Scott often wrote in favour of cooperation between the Liberals and the newly emerging Labour party, warning that failure to do so would mean “the Conservative dog running away with the bone”. The Guardian has editorially been broadly in favour of devolution, electoral reform and political alliances for most of the last century – and last time I looked it still was. Yet no one who tries to think objectively about modern politics can close their mind to the many problems. One of the most heretical for some readers is that supporting or opposing the Tories may not in fact be the defining divide of British politics. Those who define themselves on the left need to be open to the thought that Labour may in fact provide an equally important divide. There are also, whisper it who dares, progressive Tories as well as reactionary ones. It ought not to be a thought crime to consider that Ruth Davidson or David Willetts are more sympathetic political figures than some in the Labour party. A second problem is that the left is in a political pickle in many developed countries today precisely because it doesn’t have the answers to today’s problems, not because the political systems make it difficult to get its apparently virtuous answers across. The problems themselves are fairly easily stated: climate change, obesity, over-mighty financial services, declining real wages, widening inequality, ageing population, democratic failings. The answers are much harder. No party has them. Who will win the Copeland byelection? Read more A third and crucial problem is that active cooperation between parties eventually has to come down to nuts and bolts. Here the going gets tougher. If it involves electoral pacts, how extensive should they be? What is the policy towards the Scottish and Welsh nationalists – are they part of the alliance too? Supposing that an anti-Tory alliance won a general election: who would get to be in government, and are all MPs from the different tribes bound to support that government on all major votes? We are getting ahead of ourselves here. But it is important to know where the progressive alliance proposal is intended to lead. Even at this embryonic stage, when an alliance is still mainly an idea not a reality, the truth is that the two major potential cooperators, Labour and the Liberal Democrats, more frequently despise one another. Nothing would make them cooperate in the southern Tory seat where I live, for instance, even though the sitting MP is eminently beatable if it happened. Nor can it be taken for granted, as Copeland reminds us, that everyone who wants the Tories out shares the Greens’ hostility to nuclear power or cars. Making alliances is difficult. It means being pragmatic and tolerant. Many on the left are neither. In the end, with the massive exception of Brexit, the great unknown in British politics in 2017 is still whether the Labour party has a viable future as a party of government, not what comes afterwards.",diasaster:0},

She sat soaked and trembling, looking out across the Aegean for a rescue boat we knew wouldn’t come. Three hundred people had been on her boat when it sank. All night, we volunteers had been seeing in the rescue boats, providing urgent care and gathering names of the missing. We’d had reports that two newborns were flown to hospital in critical condition. Chances were that one of them was hers, but the police wouldn’t let us drive her to the hospital. Rescued at sea by the authorities, she was formally “in detention” until she registered. “No papers, no hospital,” they said. Hundreds of Calais child refugees have UK asylum claims rejected Read more Hours before, I’d performed CPR for the first time in my life, on a little boy who hadn’t survived. I was in shock too and haunted by the notion that this mother’s presence might somehow make the difference between life and death for her child. At the very least, she was being robbed of her chance to say goodbye. We sat shoulder to shoulder, in silence, with her relatives around her. “Where do you hope to go?” one of the other volunteers asked in a weak attempt to dent the silence. “To Britain,” a relative replied. “To live free.” The refugee camps have always been there, swelling quietly with the very human consequences of the political system that governs our lives. But with the age of televised warfare, the lights came on. War is becoming real for us, for the first time in a long time. Here are its orphans, its exiled freedom fighters and grieving mothers, camping out right on our doorstep. Conflict, climate change, globalisation: it can’t be some grisly reality TV show after all; here are its refugees, real human families throwing themselves on the southern steps of Fortress Europe. What happened next was extraordinary. There’s the side of the story we know: politicians scapegoating, talk of swarms and cockroaches in the press; a thundering Brexit vote followed by a spike in hate crime so sharp it gave the nation whiplash. But then there’s the other story, less often told: that well below the radar of the mainstream media, tens of thousands of people from all nations, of all ages, cultures and political persuasions, started giving up jobs, studies, relationships and reliable wifi and heading for the borderlands to do their part. They flooded in to do what politicians and aid agencies wouldn’t: from illegal ocean rescues and calling out police brutality to running art therapy classes, feeding thousands and sorting sky-high piles of donated clothes across the continent from Norway to Calais. I feel enormously proud to have been part of that movement. I learned a lot as a solidarity volunteer in Greece. Some of those lessons were traumatic – I still have nightmares a year later – but I think I learned as much about politics in weeks in Camp Moria as I did in years at university. The most personally challenging and painful lesson was a simple one: it will never be enough. However many volunteers we have pulling 15-hour shifts, politicians in halls of power far away are doing more damage in a week than we could undo in a lifetime. For all their summits, resolutions and deals, in 2015 one in 269 people crossing to Europe died; this year it’s one in 88. With deprivation and incarceration systematically inflicted on people in the name of border control, when we say “refugees welcome” that is a commitment to campaign for radical change here at home – or it’s meaningless. In December 2015 I was taken out of action by a serious spinal injury. Being forced home was infuriating. I started providing online support, fundraising, anything to fight the creeping sense of powerlessness, to stay connected. I started following the news again, watching in horror as governments closed the Balkan route and levelled camps at Calais and Dunkirk. Autonomous humanitarian aid was being criminalised, camps sealed off from independent observers and mass deportations introduced. Meanwhile, the EU-Turkey deal started edging “the refugee crisis” off our front pages; it was someone else’s problem now. Europe had paid a handsome price to make it so. It’s not about charity. It’s about recognising shared responsibility for the state of our shared world Coming home, it’s strange trying to figure out where you used to fit in. Media headlines about immigration stop being abstract and become about people we know. Apathy and discrimination start to hurt instead of just irritate because we’ve seen their casualties starving and cold and the empty orange lifejackets floating in the sea. We know what it costs. We’re not supposed to just fit back in when we come home. We’re supposed to be opening eyes. The fight for refugee and migrant rights out there can’t be won without a radical political shift here, in the heart of Fortress Europe. The solidarity-based approach developed and demonstrated by the best of the independent volunteers has enormous potential to achieve this. It has the power, not just to save lives, but to change lives; to heal the divisions in our communities torn by politicians scapegoating the poor and the undocumented for a crisis they created. It’s not about charity. It’s about recognising shared responsibility for the state of our shared world; understanding we have always been connected. By refusing to provide safe passage, refusing its fair share of refugees and detaining over 30,000 undocumented people every year, the British government is reinforcing the precedent that black and brown lives don’t matter. If that passes unchallenged, we are all forced into a more dangerous, divided and desolate world. And with states cracking down on independent solidarity work, simply saving lives is becoming a political act. This is the real refugee scandal: the UK has been locking up children | Diane Taylor Read more Humanitarian aid without a political movement is like trying to extinguish a forest fire with water one teacup at a time. Every time they raze Calais to the ground I am reminded of that painful truth. One of the most urgent battles for asylum and immigration justice in the UK is against detention. This pointless, brutal practice is the most harmful aspect of the system. It cripples the ability of detainees to fight their own legal cases or speak out for justice. With a growing protest movement at detention centres such as Yarl’s Wood, ending detention is a fight we can win right here at home. That means everything from raising awareness to the direct action of the fearless grandmas who brought immigration raids to a halt in Glasgow. A movement that broad is ambitious; but ambition and vision are all that will stop our descent into barbarism. Work that builds practical solidarity infrastructure and political resistance which work together, from the heartlands to the borderlands, outlines the way forward: projects such as These Walls Must Fall, which combines campaigning with a solidarity-based approach to migration and asylum support to empower those affected to fight back for their rights as part of our community. We’re taking on a multimillion-pound industry which profits from the system and has close ties to the government. But if we win, that victory would be felt well beyond our borders. If walls can fall in Fortress Britain – they can fall anywhere.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Head of Japan's top ad firm to quit after new recruit's death from overwork", "content": "The head of Japan’s biggest advertising agency is to resign, as prosecutors launch an investigation into his firm for enforcing excessive overtime after an overworked employee took her own life. Tadashi Ishii, the president of Dentsu, said he would step down next month, just over a year after Matsuri Takahashi killed herself at a company dormitory in a case Japanese authorities classified as karoshi, or death from overwork. “Excessive amounts of work is something that should never be allowed to happen,” Ishii told reporters. “I deeply regret and feel responsible for this. I will take full responsibility and resign as president at January’s board meeting.” Ishii said he regretted his failure to tackle the company work practices that led to Takahashi’s death, eight months after joining Dentsu in April 2015. “We deeply regret failing to prevent the overwork of our new recruit. I offer my sincere apologies,” he said. Takahashi, 24, had worked more than 100 hours of overtime a month leading up to her death. In September, a labour standards inspection office in Tokyo said she had been driven to kill herself due to stress brought on by long working hours. Japan has spent years struggling to address karoshi. About 2,000 people a year kill themselves due to work-related stress, according to the government, while other victims die from heart attacks, strokes and other conditions brought on by spending too much time at work. Death from overwork: Japan's 'karoshi' culture blamed for young man's heart failure Read more Weeks before she died on Christmas Day 2015, Takahashi posted on social media: “I want to die.” Another message read: “I’m physically and mentally shattered.” Her death prompted calls for Japan to overhaul its work culture, which often forces employees to put in long hours of overtime as a demonstration of corporate loyalty. Dentsu’s notoriously demanding work practices have long been the target of criticism and it was raided by regulators last month amid suspicions that it had broken labour standards law. On Wednesday, the labour ministry referred the company and an unnamed Dentsu executive to prosecutors on suspicion of driving Takahashi to kill herself. In response to criticism that it was doing too little to curtail excessive overtime, the firm started turning off the lights at 10pm at its Tokyo headquarters to encourage employees to go home. In its first white paper on karoshi in October, Japan’s government said one in five workers were at risk of death from overwork. The paper found that despite attempts by some companies to establish a better work-life balance, Japanese workers still spend much longer hours in the office than their peers in other countries. According to the paper, 22.7% of companies polled between December 2015 and January 2016 said some of their employees logged more than 80 hours of overtime each month – the official threshold at which the prospect of death from work becomes serious. Japanese media said any overhaul of work practices should apply across the board. “The problem is not with Dentsu alone,” the Asahi Shimbun said in a recent editorial. The paper, which itself received a government warning about overtime this month, acknowledged that changing attitudes would be difficult but was essential as it affected employee morale and productivity. Last week, on the first anniversary of her daughter’s death, Takahashi’s mother, Yukimi, said she hoped to “change the consciousness of every working person in Japan”. Ichiro Oshima, a 24-year-old Dentsu employee, killed himself in 1991 in Japan’s first recognised case of karoshi-related suicide. Oshima had not had a day off for 17 months and was sleeping for less than two hours a night before his death. In the UK, the Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123.

{ "title":"A good year for Xi Jinping – but trouble is heading his way", "content": "In his 2016 new year message the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, promised his 1.3 billion citizens that the coming 12 months would be a time of “openness and sharing”. “The future is encouraging and inspiring,” Xi enthused in his upbeat annual address. In fact, 2016 was a year of continued economic slowdown and political tightening as the leaders of one-party China sought to further assert their control over the country with one eye on economic storm clouds ahead. Free speech was increasingly curtailed while prominent activists continued to languish in jail after the launch of a major crackdown on human rights lawyers in 2015. Beijing continued to ignore muted international calls for their release. In Hong Kong, the former British colony that returned to Chinese control in 1997, the mood was scarcely more upbeat, with renewed street protests after Beijing moved to bar two pro-independence politicians from taking up their seats in the city’s parliament. Pro-democracy campaigners accused Beijing of stripping Hong Kong of its much-cherished autonomy and warned that the “one country, two systems” framework under which it is ruled was being increasingly undermined by the Communist party’s meddling. For Xi, 2016 will go down as a year of significant domestic political victories. Facebook Twitter Pinterest A woman working at a building site in Shanghai in November. Photograph: Johannes Eisele/AFP/Getty Images In October he was declared the “core leader” of the 88 million-member Communist party, a title only previously bestowed upon three leaders, Jiang Zemin, Deng Xiaoping and Chairman Mao. That reaffirming of Xi’s supreme leadership will strengthen him in the lead-up to the 19th Communist party congress next autumn, when his assumed 10-year term reaches the half-way point. But daunting challenges lie ahead in 2017. The run-up to that congress will see an intense and potentially treacherous period of political jockeying as Xi attempts to deepen his control of the party by elevating allies to key positions. The economy, already growing at its weakest rate in 25 years, is likely to slow further as China’s export- and investment-driven boom continues to run out of steam. Xi will also face a number of severe foreign policy headaches, not least formulating a response to Donald Trump’s presidency in the US and potential policy shifts on issues such as North Korea. Then there is the South China Sea. China has been locked into a series of acrimonious territorial disputes with neighbours such as Vietnam and the Philippines. In July, an international tribunal infuriated Beijing when it responded to a case brought by the Philippines by issuing a thorough rebuke of China’s sweeping historical claims to vast areas of the $4.5tn trade route. Beijing immediately rejected the ruling. The May election of Rodrigo Duterte looked to have eased some of those tensions with the Philippines’ new leader flying into Beijing in October to kick off an unexpected rapprochement with Xi that saw the territorial dispute brushed aside. In the wake of that visit – which analysts described as a major strategic coup for China and a thumb in the eye of Washington, a longtime ally of the Philippines – Beijing and Manila appeared to set aside their differences over the South China Sea in favour of economic collaboration. To Beijing’s delight, Duterte declared he would realign his country in China’s “ideological flow”.

Photograph: Getty Images Another Chinese triumph came in September when Xi and Barack Obama came together during China’s first G20 to announce that the world’s top two polluters would ratify the Paris climate agreement. Activists hailed the move as a major breakthrough in the fight against global warming. But just weeks later, the gloss came off that much-lauded achievement with the election of climate change denier Trump to the White House. The victory of Trump, who has called global warming a Chinese hoax, looks to spell the end of the climate collaboration between the people in the world’s two most powerful jobs – a rare bright spot in US-China relations under Obama – although some predict 2017 could see an unexpected revival of relations between Washington and Beijing. China will enter the year of the rooster in January – the same year in which the Chinese Communist party was founded almost a century ago, in 1921.

{ "title":"The rabbits of Watership Down reveal much about 21st century Britain", "content": "The warren seemed friendly enough. They were welcomed in and given food. So as a gesture of thanks, Hazel suggested that Dandelion tell their new friends one of the great rabbit stories. Who doesn’t like a story? So Dandelion recounted one of the popular tales of clever El-ahrairah, the prince of rabbits, and how he tricked King Darzin into handing over his lettuce. And though Dandelion told the story well, these new rabbits seemed oddly unimpressed. “Very nice,” said Cowslip, being polite. And not knowing what else to say he just repeated, “Yes, very nice”. It was almost as if the rabbits in Cowslip’s warren didn’t much care for stories. “But he must know it, surely?” puzzled Blackberry. “Well,” explained Cowslip, “we don’t tell the old stories very much.” The death of Richard Adams on Christmas Eve has taken me back to his great masterpiece, Watership Down, a novel that captured the imagination of generations of children and adults alike. And while Adams insisted that it was not meant to be a political novel or parable, just the sort of story with which you might entertain your children on a long car journey, political readings have proven irresistible. After all, the story of a group of rabbits looking for a new home after their original warren has been destroyed by property developers inevitably invites an environmental reading. One of the instincts behind Brexit was a powerful desire to find a way to tell a common story about ourselves But for me, by far the most interesting political reading comes from the American theologian Stanley Hauerwas, who proposed that it contained an important message about the relationship between stories and moral values; that Adams’ rabbits – like human beings – are shaped into a community by the power of the stories they tell each other. And these stories are the bearers of our moral values. And that was the problem with Cowslip’s warren – they no longer had a common story around which to define themselves. For Hauerwas, the Cowslip warren is a warning about what happens to a community when the individual is tasked with generating his or her own meaning in the absence of some shared story. The day after Hazel and his friends discover that Cowslip’s warren is not interested in stories, one of the rabbits gets caught in a farmer’s snare. As he lies choking and bleeding, none of the rabbits in the Cowslip warren offers to help. They have become a loose collection of individuals, concerned principally with their own individual rights and freedoms, but without a shared story that might bind them to each other. Part of Hauerwas’s target is political liberalism and the idea that the state must refuse to tell any one story about what constitutes the good and instead serve as a neutral referee, doing little more than managing the competition that exists between individual desires. This sort of state liberalism believes there are competing big stories, and that it can’t be the job of the state to decide between them. As it happens, and in theory at least, the UK does have an official story because the Church of England is the state religion – so the story of the child of Bethlehem, and his death and resurrection, is still the official story of this country. That is why prayers are still said in parliament and why the Queen is the head of the church. But in reality these are but the fragments of a time when we used to be a story-formed community – and that story was Christianity. Now, like Cowslip, we don’t tell the old stories very much. Some prefer Happy Holidays to Happy Christmas, using a neutral description so as not to offend. It’s the same instinct that prefers the state to be a management exercise, a way to triage the will-to-power of millions of its citizens, and keeps it away from big narratives about what constitutes the good. I understand why it has to be this way. We are a multicultural society, an ocean of different stories threading in and out of each other– as Salman Rushdie described in another great children’s book, Haroun and the Sea of Stories. But it’s not just the priest in me that regrets the abandonment of a common story that binds us together and holds our moral values. And if liberals dismiss all this as mere nostalgia they will keep losing elections. For one of the instincts behind Brexit was a powerful desire to find a way to tell a common story about ourselves, and thus a story of how we are part of one community – and not just, like Cowslip’s warren, a story of individual rights and freedoms. How about an all-embracing story like that told at the London Olympics? Because if the left don’t write the story, the right surely will.",diasaster:0},

He said he had a similar experience at the hands of the Home Office to Hawkins, a Dutch woman who was told to make preparations to leave the UK after she applied for British citizenship following the EU referendum. This was despite her living in the UK for 24 years and having two children with her British husband. Home Office urged to fix 'absurd' permanent residency process Read more Schwarzkopf said: “I am a German citizen who moved to the UK in 1999 to study neuroscience at Cardiff University, both my undergraduate degree and my PhD. After I got my PhD in 2007, I decided to remain in the UK to work. I am now married to a British woman and am a faculty member at University College London. “I originally applied for that permanent residence document in March 2016 because it is necessary for a British citizenship application. “In June, one week before the referendum, my application was rejected. The reason was that I hadn’t included my passport in the application, only a legally certified colour copy. This rejection letter contained the phrase that I ‘should now make preparations to leave’ the UK. “I was pretty pissed off at that moment, so I wrote a couple of complaint letters including [one] to the then home secretary Theresa May (she never got back to me). “Just to be clear, I don’t think that was anything more than a mistake on the part of the Home Office. They simply use these standard letters. “But it is also quite outrageous. Under current rules, EU/EEA [European Economic Area] nationals automatically gain permanent residence after five years (provided certain criteria are met at least). The PR document I applied for doesn’t give me permanent residence rights, it simply confirms them. So it really should be a formality. But the Home Office seems to want to make it excessively difficult for people. “The rejection letter actually acknowledged that I had a German passport. It said that they couldn’t verify my nationality from a photocopy because they can be fabricated. That’s fair enough, but you might think they practice some assumption of innocence until proven guilty of passport forgery. “But I would also have fully accepted if they had simply told me to reapply and include the passport this time. However, telling me to leave the country even though it should be blatantly obvious that in all likelihood I actually am an EU citizen is just offensive, and more importantly it also directly violates free movement rights. “My MP got involved in this, writing letters to the Home Office, and this was very helpful. At first they explained that this was simply the way they write their rejection letters, but eventually someone wrote back with an apology. More importantly, they said they would take this issue on board and consider changing the phrasing. From the story in the Guardian, it sounds that at least so far they haven’t changed it yet.”",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Bumper year ahead for British tourism thanks to pound slump", "content": "In 2017 Britain is expected to see the biggest rise in tourist spending in four years and a surge in visitor numbers, partly thanks to the slump in the value of the pound since the Brexit vote. Overseas visitors are expected to spend £24.1bn next year, up 8% on 2016, according to VisitBritain, the government-backed national tourism agency. Just over 38.1 million tourists are expected to enter the UK, up 4%, drawn by celebrations such as the 20th anniversary of the publication of the first Harry Potter book and the 200th year since the death of Jane Austen, as well as the potential to snap up luxury bargains. “These figures not only underpin a longer-term pattern of growth for inbound tourism, one of our fastest growing export industries, but also demonstrate its growing importance as a key driver for economic growth and jobs. “With our hotels, shops and attractions all offering excellent value for overseas visitors right now, it’s a great time to come to Britain,” said VisitBritain’s chief executive, Sally Balcombe. Facebook Twitter Pinterest The Lake District, where hotels are reporting double-digit growth in international bookings Photograph: Peter Robinson/Alamy While tourist spending will be boosted by a 2.7% rise in inflation next year, the group said the 10%-plus fall in the value of the pound against the euro and the dollar since the EU referendum in June meant tourists’ budgets would now stretch further. The currency depreciation triggered by the result of the June referendum has left sterling hovering at its lowest level against the dollar for more than 30 years. Hotels, restaurants and some retailers have already been enjoying a boost from the increased tourist spending since the Brexit vote. Tax free spending by visitors from outside the EU soared 41% in October and November, according to retail tourism group Global Blue, as spending by Chinese tourists, who make up a quarter of non-European visitors, rose 63% while Americans spent 88% more. Gordon Clark, managing director of Global Blue, said: “Overall we expect total UK international tax free spend for 2016 to finish on double digit growth, due to the visitor and spend surge in the second half of the year.” The Ritz said it had enjoyed a 12.5% rise in room reservations in December compared with last year. That was partly thanks to its restaurant being awarded its first Michelin star but also part of a 9% rise in visitors to the Piccadilly and St James’s areas of central London compared with December last year.

{ "title":"Obama expels 35 Russian diplomats in retaliation for US election hacking", "content": "The Obama administration on Thursday announced its retaliation for Russian efforts to interfere with the US presidential election, ordering sweeping new sanctions that included the expulsion of 35 Russians. Syrian rivals sign ceasefire deal backed by Russia Read more US intelligence services believe Russia ordered cyber-attacks on the Democratic National Committee (DNC), Hillary Clinton’s campaign and other political organizations, in an attempt to influence the election in favor of the Republican candidate, Donald Trump. In a statement issued two weeks after the president said he would respond to cyber-attacks by Moscow “at a time and place of our choosing”, Obama said Americans should “be alarmed by Russia’s actions” and pledged further action. “I have issued an executive order that provides additional authority for responding to certain cyber activity that seeks to interfere with or undermine our election processes and institutions, or those of our allies or partners,” Obama said in the statement, released while he was vacationing with his family in Hawaii. “Using this new authority, I have sanctioned nine entities and individuals: the GRU and the FSB, two Russian intelligence services; four individual officers of the GRU; and three companies that provided material support to the GRU’s cyber operations. “In addition, the secretary of the treasury is designating two Russian individuals for using cyber-enabled means to cause misappropriation of funds and personal identifying information.” He also announced the closure of two Russian compounds in the US. Obama added that more actions would be taken, “some of which will not be publicized”. On Thursday, Trump, who has previously dismissed reports of Russian interference in the election, said in a statement: “It’s time for our country to move on to bigger and better things.” He added, however, that “in the interest of our country and its great people, I will meet with leaders of the intelligence community next week in order to be updated on the facts of this situation.” In a conference call with reporters, senior White House officials said the president-elect’s transition team was informed of the sanctions before they were announced on Thursday. Trump and Obama spoke on Wednesday, they said. The officials added that the actions were a necessary response to “very disturbing Russian threats to US national security”. “There has to be a cost and a consequence for what Russia has done,” a senior administration official said. “It is in a extraordinary step for them to interfere in the democratic process here in the United States of America. There needs to be a price for that.” In Moscow, a Putin spokesman said Russia regretted the new sanctions and would consider retaliatory measures. Diplomatic expulsions are normally met with exactly reciprocal action. In this case, however, Moscow may pause for thought. With Trump, who has spoken positively about Russia and Vladimir Putin, just three weeks away from the White House, Russia may feel it is inadvisable to kick out 35 US diplomats. However, Russian authorities on Thursday ordered the Anglo-American School of Moscow closed, according to CNN, citing a US official briefed on the matter. The school serves children of US, British and Canadian embassy personnel, and would effectively make a Russian posting difficult for US diplomats with families. Konstantin Kosachyov, chairman of the international affairs committee in the upper house of the Russian parliament, was quoted by the RIA news agency as saying the US move represented “the death throes of political corpses”. The Twitter feed of the Russian embassy in London, meanwhile, called the Obama administration “hapless” and attached a picture of a duck with the word “LAME” emblazoned across it. On the White House call, officials were asked about the prospect of Trump overturning the sanctions.

Climate deniers, conspiracists and one-percenters: Trump's cabinet of characters Read more “We have no reason to believe that Russia’s activities will cease,” a senior official said. “One reason why I think it is necessary to sustain these actions is because there’s every reason to believe Russia will interfere with future US elections.” On Capitol Hill, Democrats applauded the president’s action, called for further measures and emphasized bipartisan support for a thorough investigation into Russian hacking. “I hope the incoming Trump administration, which has been far too close to Russia throughout the campaign and transition, won’t think for one second about weakening these new sanctions or our existing regime,” incoming Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer said in a statement. “Both parties ought to be united in standing up to Russian interference in our elections, to their cyber attacks, their illegal annexation of Crimea and other extra-legal interventions.” Ben Cardin, the top Democrat on the Senate foreign relations committee, called for further sanctions from the new Congress when it convenes in January. GOP leaders were quick to frame the new sanctions as too little, too late. “While today’s action by the administration is overdue,” House speaker Paul Ryan said in a statement, “it is an appropriate way to end eight years of failed policy with Russia. And it serves as a prime example of this administration’s ineffective foreign policy that has left America weaker in the eyes of the world.” Republican senators John McCain and Lindsey Graham, two of Russia’s fiercest critics, echoed Ryan but also called for tough Congressional sanctions. “Ultimately, [the sanctions] are a small price for Russia to pay for its brazen attack on American democracy,” the two men said in a joint statement. “We intend to lead the effort in the new Congress to impose stronger sanctions on Russia.” Fight between police officer and US diplomat broadcast on Russian TV Read more The 35 Russian diplomats being expelled are “intelligence operatives”, Obama said. The state department has declared them “persona non grata” and they will be given 72 hours to leave the country. Starting on Friday at noon, the White House said, Russia will be denied access to compounds in Maryland and New York that have been used for intelligence-related purposes. A statement from the state department said the diplomatic expulsions were a response not only to hacking but to “a pattern of harassment of our diplomats overseas, that has increased over the last four years, including a significant increase in the last 12 months”. The statement said the harassment has included “arbitrary police stops, physical assault, and the broadcast on state TV of personal details about our personnel that put them at risk”. For some time, US diplomats in Russia have anecdotally reported being followed and harassed by police. In June, a US diplomat was wrestled to the ground by a policeman as he scrambled to get inside the embassy.

{ "title":"'Dad was an alcoholic': MP Jonathan Ashworth urges action on drinking", "content": "Childhood memories of growing up with an alcoholic father have prompted the shadow health secretary to call for greater recognition of the damage done by excessive drinking. Jonathan Ashworth said there was a need for urgent action because the cost of alcohol-related harm was not just the £3.5bn NHS price-tag, but up to £7bn in lost productivity for the British economy. During an interview with the Guardian, the Labour MP said he also wanted there to be much more focus on the needs of families affected by alcoholism, claiming the issue would be a priority for him and Labour in 2017. Ashworth said he was surprised to find himself disclosing, for the first time to a national newspaper, the reason he felt so passionately about the issue. “It’s quite personal for me, because my dad was an alcoholic,” he said, suddenly spilling out early memories of his father falling over drunkenly at the school gates and of returning home to a fridge stacked with cheap booze and no food. Ashworth said he had never really considered his experience as something relevant in policy terms. “You didn’t think there was a problem, you just thought ‘that is the life I’ve got’,” he said. Then he came across the work being carried out by his Labour colleague, Liam Byrne, whose childhood was affected in a similar way. The MP’s all-party parliamentary group dedicated to the children of alcoholics has revealed that local authorities across the country tend to have no specific strategies to help young people affected in this way. The group, which is publishing research on the issue in the new year, said that millions of children were “suffering in silence”. Inspired by Byrne’s work, Ashworth felt he wanted to make the issue a priority in 2017. “I wanted to do something on alcoholism so that if nothing else I’ll have done something on that,” he said, before adding: “I know it’s cliched.” As well as backing Byrne’s ideas he wants to support a phoneline run by the National Association for Children of Alcoholics to help make it a nationwide service. He also wants more specialised training for professionals to support children and for councils to be properly funded to be able to reach out to families affected by alcoholism through schools, via community nurses and in Sure Start children’s centres. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Ashworth was inspired by Labour MP Liam Byrne who has set up an all-party parliamentary group dedicated to the children of alcoholics. Photograph: Peter Macdiarmid/Getty Images Ashworth talked about his own experience as an only child in a working-class part of north Manchester after his mother, who worked as a barmaid, and his father, a croupier in a Salford casino, divorced. He spoke vividly about the days that he stayed with his father – whom he said he loved dearly. “I remember him falling over when he picked me up at the school gates and we’d get home and there would be nothing in the fridge other than bottles of wine – he drank cheap horrible bottles of white wine … and cans of lager and Stone’s bitter,” said Ashworth. “When I got to 11 or 12 then I was effectively looking after him on the weekends because he was drunk all weekend,” he said, pausing before adding: “And eventually he died.” Ashworth recalled trying to persuade his father not to move to Thailand one Christmas. The MP said he knew in his heart it would end badly, but his father replied: “No, I’m going,” and he went. “I never saw him again,” said the MP. About a year later he received a call telling him to travel to the small apartment where his father had been staying. When he got there he found his bed surrounded by empty whisky bottles. “He was in Thailand for that last year drinking a bottle of whisky a day … I had to clear it up. That was my life. He was 60.” Ashworth said his father, also called Jon, had not been offered formal help, although he himself had tried to raise the issue of his drinking as an adult. He said his dad thought he was OK because he didn’t touch alcohol during his working hours. “But as a child I didn’t see him at work,” he said. Ashworth, who was politically active for the Labour party from the age of 15, through college and on into a job advising Gordon Brown, said the experience with his dad left him feeling “not damaged but determined”. The MP for LeicesterSouth – who was promoted to shadow health secretary by Jeremy Corbyn after his second victory in a leadership contest – now feels he has an opportunity to take action. As well as the work he outlined with charities and councils, he believes that part of the solution must also be a cultural drive to have alcoholism taken more seriously. Ashworth recalled how “people used to think it was funny – a right laugh” that his dad was a drinker. He remembered his father in goal in the work football team and people pointing off the pitch and shouting: “Oh Jon Ash is in goal – just throw a crate of Stella in that direction and he’ll go after that.” “And I was like ‘oh yeah that’s funny’, but actually that was my dad and for my teenage years I was looking after him. It just became a norm. I had to grow up very fast.” But he is not just concerned about alcohol. “Public health has been cut back by the Tories but they are storing up huge problems,” he said. “Obesity is a huge problem that costs the NHS billions. The debate on obesity and diabetes hasn’t punched through.” Ashworth said there were lessons to be learned from the bold action to ban smoking in public places, which had a massive impact. He called for much more direct action on poor diet. “I think we have to be bold about what we say to the advertising industry – not just with kids programmes but families sitting down watching The X Factor. Think of the hundreds of thousands of calories being advertised this winter in the run-up to Christmas,” said Ashworth, arguing that fast food and supermarkets selling “tasty treats” were all over family viewing times. “The government watered this down. There were going to be stricter restrictions on the industry, [David] Cameron was going to go for it and the story is that Theresa May got her red pen out and cut it out. I think we have got to be bold.”",diasaster:0},

He later appeared to attempt to row back on the claim, telling CNN: “We had no helicopter. We don’t use that”. He described the incident as “just the creative imagination of this Tulfo,” without explaining what a Tulfo was. It comes a few weeks after he admitted killing people during his 22 years as a mayor of Davao city, sometimes riding a motorcycle looking for “encounters to kill”. He said those killings were part of legitimate police operations, including a hostage incident. Some senators have warned Duterte he risks impeachment over his comments. Duterte also said six people arrested last week during a seizure in the capital of more than half a tonne of methamphetamine, known locally as “shabu”, were fortunate he was out of town. “They were lucky I was not in Manila that time. If I had known there were that much shabu inside a house, I would definitely kill you,” he said. “Let’s not make any drama, I will personally gun you down if nobody else will do it.” It was not immediately clear when or where the helicopter incident Duterte spoke of took place. His spokesman, Ernesto Abella, also suggested it may not have actually happened. “Let’s just say, urban legend,” Abella said, without elaborating.

Elite special forces pushed into the Karama and Quds neighbourhoods, while army troops and federal police advanced into the nearby areas of Intisar, Salam and Sumor. Smoke rose across the city as explosions and machine gun fire echoed through the streets. Stiff resistance by the militants, civilians trapped inside their houses and bad weather have slowed advances in the more than two-month-old offensive to recapture Iraq’s second largest city, the extremist group’s last urban bastion in the country. It is the biggest Iraqi military operation since the 2003 US-led invasion. 'A more dangerous long-term threat': Al-Qaida grows as Isis retreats Read more Lt Gen Abdul-Wahab al-Saadi, commander of the special forces in eastern Mosul, said on Tuesday that his forces had been bolstered by reinforcements and were now less than two miles from the Tigris river which divides the city. A coalition airstrike this week destroyed the last remaining bridge over the river. The special forces, officially known as the Counter Terrorism Service, have done most of the fighting, pushing in from the east. Regular army troops on the city’s south-east and northern edges, as well as militarised federal police further west, have not moved in weeks, unable to penetrate the city. The troops have faced gruelling urban fighting, often going house to house against Isis militants who have had more than two years to dig in and prepare. Even in districts that have been recaptured, Iraqi troops have faced surprise attacks, shelling and car bombs. The extremists have launched more than 900 car bombs against Iraqi troops in and around Mosul. Saadi said he expected Iraqi forces would drive Isis from Mosul and the rest of Nineveh province within three months. Iraqi leaders had previously vowed to drive the extremists from Mosul by the end of 2016. Isis captured Mosul in the summer of 2014 when it swept across much of northern and central Iraq and the group’s leader declared the establishment of its self-styled caliphate from the pulpit of a Mosul mosque. The city is still home to about a million people but roughly 120,000 have fled since the operation began on 17 October, according to the United Nations.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Pension expert call for scrutiny over Sports Direct sale of Dunlop", "content": "A pensions expert has raised questions about the fate of the Dunlop Slazenger pension fund as Sports Direct prepares to sell the Dunlop sports brand to its Japanese distributor, Sumitomo Rubber Industries. Accounts for Dunlop Slazenger International, a subsidiary of Sports Direct, indicate the company had a £9.2m pension deficit in April 2015, with sales of £30.6m for the 12 months to 26 April and a loss of more than £20m. Sports Direct has said it is only selling the Dunlop brand – best known for its green flash tennis shoes. It will retain Slazenger, the supplier of Wimbledon’s tennis balls. Pensions expert John Ralfe, who recently advised a parliamentary committee inquiry into the handling of the BHS pension fund, said: “Will the new owners be guaranteeing the pension obligations of the company they are buying?” He added that new legislation should be brought in to ensure that such guarantees were given in future. Frank Field, who chairs the work and pensions select committee, said the Pensions Regulator should be closely examining the Dunlop deal and publicly flagging up any issues. “What can be gained by the regulator’s secrecy?” he said. Sports Direct should “give reassurance that it is not going to dump the deficit on the pension protection fund and the regulator should be active and reviewing this”, he said. The regulator declined to comment on a specific case and said seeking clearance was a voluntary matter. MPs have called for the pension regulator to be given powers to veto takeover deals which put too much strain on pension schemes, among a raft of measures they believe could help avoid a rerun of the situation at retailer BHS, which collapsed in April and prompted recriminations about its £571m pension deficit. It is unclear whether the pension deficit has changed since the accounts for the year to April 2015 were filed. Sports Direct declined to comment, citing confidentiality and stock market rules. In a statement to the stock market earlier this week, Sports Direct said the Dunlop business made a pretax profit of £4m on sales of £41.8m this year, figures which it said were unaudited. Accounts filed for the Dunlop Slazenger group in 2015 at Companies House show a £22.3m loss. The group was technically insolvent, with more liabilities than assets but the accounts state that Dunlop Slazenger remained a going concern as working capital was financed by Sports Direct. Sports Direct’s founder and major shareholder, Mike Ashley, acquired Dunlop Slazenger for an estimated £40m in 2004 from Royal Bank of Scotland – which had taken control of the struggling business from its private equity-backed owners. The company is selling Dunlop to a Japanese buyer in a surprise $137.5m (£112m) deal. Sumitomo Rubber Industries, which already owns the Dunlop rights in Japan, South Korea and Taiwan, confirmed that it will acquire the remaining international rights to the brand, as well as its sporting goods and licensing businesses. The deal is scheduled to be completed in May 2017. As part of the deal it has granted Sports Direct a royalty free licence to continue to usethe Dunlop brand for premium workwear and safety wear sold in its own stores. Last year, Dunlop Slazenger’s sales were about half the £58m recorded in the year before Ashley took over the group. In 2003 it made a £5.5m loss while its pension deficit stood at £13.3m.

{ "title":"The Guardian view on 1917: the joy of 100", "content": "A century, a hundred years, a ton: whatever it is called, those two zeroes make it an irresistible measure, big enough to serve as a yardstick of human activity, not so great that the consequences of events beyond a human lifespan are fully comprehended. This year, 2016, feels unmistakably like a watershed, a point of departure to which future historians will return again and again in search of explanation and illumination. Brexit, Trump, these are events all the more shocking for their causes afterwards being so apparently plain to see. But moments in history often move swiftly from the astonishing to the blindingly obvious. The year that starts this Sunday, 2017, is the centenary of another year like 2016, a year that also marked an irreversible shift in the world order. The political world and, with it, the human imagination were reconfigured in ways that were sometimes instantly obvious – the two Russian revolutions in February and October, for example, or the dawn of total war marked by unrestrained U-boat attacks on allied shipping and the first bombing raids on civilian London. But the full ramifications of other developments – the Balfour declaration, for example, also in 1917 – did not become clear for a generation. Even now the pattern of the mosaic that emerged with the twisting of the kaleidoscope in 1917 is open to reassessment: see, for example, an essay by the historian Adam Tooze in this month’s Prospect magazine in which he describes the end of the American century, the 100 years of dominance of the idea of liberal democracy that began with US entry into the first world war in 1917. Often what seems obvious can also mask other significant changes. The Bolshevik overthrow of the first, feeble attempt at parliamentary government in Russia, or the extinguishing of all prospect of a negotiated peace after the entry of the US into the war, never ceased to be the defining events of the year. But only later can it be seen how revolution in Russia coincided with and gave heart to the development of radical nationalism in China and India. And, while radical movements in Europe took their cue not only from Bolshevism but from the message it carried about the possibility of change, the fear of the contagion of revolution led to the rise a reactionary and nationalistic right. Only hindsight reveals how Bolshevism in Russia slowed the prospect of a liberal reform of Europe’s imperial powers; as Professor Tooze points out, 1917 was not just a year of revolution, but the year that the precursor of the Nazi party was founded. And only with its collapse, 25 years ago this week, did it become clear how communism froze diverse popular movements throughout the Russian empire. It was the thaw in the permafrost after the red flag was lowered over the Kremlin that exposed old nationalist divisions from Azerbaijan to Georgia. It is not only that more subtle changes on the landscape of the past are exposed. As real memory fades, other narratives expand in its place. Images, like Paul Nash’s Menin Road, first conceived early in 1917, and the written word, like the poems of Wilfred Owen, which were powerfully influenced by a meeting with Siegfried Sassoon that year, came to replace the tales of glory. History can be used, and abused, but the historian’s eye always plays a part in translating the present.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"ID cards and wider issues of voter engagement", "content": "It is far too easy to impersonate someone at a polling station and claim their vote (Voters in local elections will be required to show ID in anti-fraud trials, 28 December). But there is little evidence that the problem is widespread. The Electoral Commission found that there were 19 allegations made following the EU referendum relating to personation at a polling station (some of which resulted in no further action decisions), while a total of 33,577,342 votes were cast. A far greater problem, according to the government’s own estimates, is that levels of electoral registration have declined from around 95% in the 1950s to around 82/83% in recent years. Most polling stations in the 2015 general election turned away people who may well have been entitled to vote. The government should therefore be taking steps to make sure that every person entitled to vote is actually included on the electoral registers. Much more could be done very easily and at minimal cost to include those people who will soon reach the age of 18 and those registering at colleges etc. People should also be able to check online whether or not they are currently registered. Chris Rennard Liberal Democrat, co-chair, all party group on democratic participation, House of Lords • The government is correct to ignore some of Eric Pickles’ more retrograde recommendations such as banning selfies and non-English languages at polling stations. It is also correct to seek to address the current lack of voter verification we see throughout elections. However, the government risks isolating communities by ruling out the possibility of introducing a separate voter identity document for those without traditional forms of ID. A real pilot scheme would test all viable options, including a separate voter identity document. Rather than tackling voter fraud, the minister responsible, Chris Skidmore, should be focusing on how to boost voter engagement. Estimates show that 95% of the UK’s 19,000 elected politicians were voted in on turnouts of less than 50%. In the EU referendum, 13 million people did not vote. On top of that, voters with vision impairments, voters with disabilities and voters abroad are virtually locked out of the voting system. Rather than tinkering with a broken system of the past, we should instead look to the future of elections and create a system fit for the 21st century. Areeq Chowdhury Chief executive, Institute for Digital Democracy, London • Yet again we are being told Brits don’t need ID cards. So to show we are entitled to vote, open a bank account, get NHS access etc, we will still have to fiddle around with passports, driving licences, utility bills. Why? One piece of ID is all anyone needs. National insurance numbers are automatically issued at age 16. Why not start at birth or when naturalised or given right of residence? A simple way to prove who you are. Or am I the simple one? Teresa Gautrey Wokingham, Berkshire • As important as the identity of the voter is the secrecy of the ballot (Voter IDs could disenfranchise millions, 28 December). The present system allows checking on how you voted by the simple method of the polling clerk issuing voting slips from a cheque-book-like arrangement, with the left-hand stub on which your polling number is recorded bearing an identifying number corresponding to the same number in the corner of the counterfoil which is torn off for you to vote on. So any voting slip deemed suspicious can be traced back to the relevant stub book. It may be less contentious to issue a national identity card, as in the second world war; less contentious now that a majority has voted in a referendum for more “control”. It may yet be a small price to pay for a proper secret ballot. DBC Reed Northampton • The crowd may want its money back judging by the analysis applied to arrive at the conclusion “the US presidential election outcome was correct”, after “a crowdfunded recount of key states”. One of the election result reviewers (‘My students could hack the US election’, 29 December) claimed “… my undergraduate security class could have changed the outcome of the presidential election”. And previous research having “demonstrated security vulnerabilities in every model of voting machine”, allowing “an attacker to silently rewrite the electronic record of how many votes each candidate received”, surely undermines the reviewer’s claim that “the state can prove statistically that the vote has not been tampered with [by] counting a small but statistically significant, randomly selected sample of ballot papers”. No matter how significant or random the sample, rubbish in means rubbish out. He also concludes that an “auditable paper-trail for electronic voting” is important but it is shocking “how unlikely states are to look at any of the paper”, opening the clear possibility that irregular electronic voting would not have been discovered, so might possibly have been part of a sample.

In the lawsuit filed on Wednesday, Burke Ramsey, 29, claims the network, its production company and the experts interviewed in the series on the unsolved murder conspired to defame him for publicity and profit. The series, called The Case of JonBenét Ramsey, aired in September ahead of the 20th anniversary of JonBenét’s death. The beauty pageant star was found dead in the basement of her family’s home in Boulder, Colorado, the day after Christmas in 1996. A prosecutor cleared her parents and brother in 2008 based on DNA evidence. But the district attorney currently overseeing the case has said it was premature to exonerate the Ramseys and ordered additional tests using new DNA testing technology that authorities hope will further the investigation. Police have collected and studied thousands of pieces of evidence and say the case remains open. CBS spokesman Dustin Smith declined to comment on the lawsuit, which is the second Ramsey has filed over the television series. In October, Ramsey sued a forensic pathologist featured on the show who said he bludgeoned his sister to death. The pathologist is also named in the latest lawsuit, which was filed in Michigan, where Ramsey lives. The new lawsuit says CBS and its featured experts set out to conduct a “sham reinvestigation” of the murder with “the preconceived storyline” that Ramsey killed his sister and conspired with his parents to cover it up. “The accusation that Burke Ramsey killed his sister was based on a compilation of lies, half-truths, manufactured information, and the intentional omission and avoidance of truthful information about the murder of JonBenét Ramsey,” the lawsuit says.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Syria ceasefire appears to hold after rivals sign Russia-backed deal", "content": "A ceasefire has come into effect across Syria after the Assad regime and the opposition agreed to a nationwide deal brokered by Turkey and Russia. It is hoped the fragile pact could mark a key turning point and usher in peace talks aimed at bringing an end to the six-year conflict that has killed nearly half a million people and displaced half of Syria’s population. The deal came into force at midnight (10pm GMT) on Thursday and appeared to be holding early on Friday after reports of clashes early on. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitoring group said rebels had violated the truce deal and taken over a position in Hama province, while a rebel group also accused the government of shelling areas in Atshan and Skeik villages in Idlib province, which borders Hama. By morning, though, calm prevailed in the areas included in the deal, according to monitors. It is the third ceasefire agreement this year. There was confusion over which rebel groups have signed up, but officials from all sides said they hoped this time the pact would hold in the run-up to talks next month in Astana, Kazakhstan’s capital, that could lay out a path to peace. “We consider the ceasefire an important step to resolve the Syrian conflict,” said Ibrahim Kalin, the spokesman for the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. “Along with the Russian Federation, we support this arrangement as a guarantor.” Notably absent from the brokering of the deal was the US, which has moved to the sidelines in recent months as Moscow has stepped up military and diplomatic involvement in Syria. Rebel groups, including the powerful Ahrar al-Sham Islamist movement and Jaysh al-Islam, which operates mostly near Damascus, signed up to the agreement after hours of negotiations in Ankara. The Syrian military said it would cease combat operations except against terrorist groups including Islamic State and Jabhat Fateh al-Sham, the former al-Qaida wing in Syria that has publicly severed ties with the global terror network. Facebook Twitter Pinterest A Syrian army soldier places a Syrian national flag during a battle with rebel fighters at the Ramouseh front line, east of Aleppo. Photograph: Hassan Ammar/AP “We have just received news that a few hours ago the event we have all been waiting for and working towards has happened,” the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, said of the signing of the deal during a televised meeting with Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, and its defence minister, Sergei Shoigu. Putin said three documents had been signed: a ceasefire agreement between the Syrian government and the armed opposition; a list of control mechanisms to ensure the ceasefire would work; and a statement of intent to begin negotiations on a political end to the conflict. Speaking before the midnight deadline, Putin described the ceasefire as fragile and said it would “require a lot of attention”. The deal comes after a series of significant losses for the opposition and a shift in the war’s momentum in favour of the regime of Bashar al-Assad. The rebels recently lost control of half of the city of Aleppo, the last major city in Syria in which they had a presence, their defence lines crushed in weeks of sustained attack. They have also come under bombardment in the province of Idlib and in rural areas near Damascus. Elsewhere they have made no significant gains for much of the past year, their firepower blunted by Russia’s relentless air campaign. Syria map The deal may yet founder as others have in the past year, over the competing interests struggling for dominance in Syria. The regime and Iran may decide not to honour the agreement, seeking to capitalise on their recent victories to finally crush the rebellion. Jabhat Fateh al-Sham has acted as a spoiler in previous agreements including the Aleppo evacuation, and it has entrenched itself among the Islamist rebels who have signed up to the pact. And if the talks in Astana next month fail as other peace initiatives have, the fighting is likely to resume. The talks are set to include Russia, Turkey and Iran, whose top diplomats met earlier this month in an effort to kickstart peace talks, as well as representatives from the regime and the opposition. The absence of the United States offers a hint at the frustration over American policies on Syria, both within Russia, the key backer of Syrian strongman Assad, and Turkey, a stalwart supporter of the opposition. Ankara and Moscow recently mended ties after a months-long estrangement over the shooting down of a Russian fighter jet that had strayed into Turkish airspace. Key differences remain between the two powers, with Turkey eager to see Assad leave and the Kremlin playing a crucial role in his recent battlefield victories. The two countries recently negotiated an evacuation deal that saw the defeated rebels in Aleppo and tens of thousands of civilians leave the embattled city after a ferocious offensive by Assad’s allies, primarily Iranian-backed militias from Iraq and Lebanon. Moscow hopes a peace deal will cement its role as a regional and global power that intervened in Syria decisively while the rebels’ backers, including the US, dithered. Ankara hopes to limit the fallout from the war across the border, which has driven over 2 million refugees into the country, with many more expected to flee if the Syrian government resumes its military campaign in Idlib, which borders Turkey. It also wants to blunt the expansion of Kurdish paramilitaries in northern Syria, whose plans for an autonomous zone it considers a national security threat. The peace talks also highlight the complex web of interests involved in the Syrian war. Turkey and Russia brokered this agreement, as well as the Aleppo evacuation, on behalf of Syrian proxies and are now set to play a role as guarantors in the absence of American or UN involvement in the talks. There was confusion over whether Jabhat Fateh al-Sham is included in the deal. Turkish officials said groups designated by the UN security council were excluded from the agreement, but a senior rebel official said the militants were covered by the ceasefire. The group was considered a legitimate target for military action under previous ceasefires. “A general ceasefire that does not exclude any of the areas under the control of the rebels, and does not exclude any faction in those areas, will go into effect at 12 [midnight] Syria time,” said Osama Abu Zeid, a legal adviser with the Free Syrian Army, who is involved in the negotiations. 'I couldn't take anything except dignity': stories of the leaving of Aleppo Read more In Damascus, the Syrian army said the ceasefire came after the “successes achieved by the armed forces”, an apparent reference to the capture of rebel-held neighbourhoods of Aleppo this month. Lavrov said talks to implement the agreements would take place soon in Astana, and would involve Russia, Turkey, Iran and possibly Egypt, as well as the parties to the Syrian conflict. At a later stage other players including Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Jordan could be asked to join, he added. Lavrov said the US could be invited to join after Donald Trump became president next month, in order that the countries could work “in a friendly and collective manner”. A state department spokesman described news of the ceasefire as a “positive development” that the US hoped would be “implemented fully and respected by all parties”. “Any effort that stops the violence, saves lives, and creates the conditions for renewed and productive political negotiations would be welcome,” the spokesman said. Erdoğan described the ceasefire as a “historic opportunity” that should not be wasted. He told a news conference in Ankara: “This is a window of opportunity that has been opened and should not be squandered.” The ceasefire will be the first nationwide halt to the fighting since a week-long truce in September that collapsed after several incidents of violence. A previous truce implemented in February also fell apart. Both those deals were organised by Russia and the US. Russian state television has presented the country’s intervention as a black-and-white struggle against terrorism, with none of the distressing images of regime victims and the bombardment of Aleppo shown. Russian officials were quick to talk up the ceasefire as vindication of Moscow’s strategy. “Russia has again proved its leading role in international peacekeeping activities,” said Sergei Zheleznyak, a Russian MP and member of the parliament’s international affairs committee. He called the agreement “a major diplomatic, military and political success”. If a ceasefire can hold and meaningful progress is made on negotiations, it will indeed be a huge coup for Putin, who launched Moscow’s first intervention outside the borders of the former Soviet Union since the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, in order to provide backing to Assad. Putin will also take satisfaction in the successful sidelining of the US from the process, after years of fruitless discussions between the two countries’ foreign ministers over Syria. It was no accident that in noting all the “interested powers” who might be involved in the talks, the US was mentioned way down the list, after regional players. And it was pointed of Lavrov to say the US could be included in talks only after Trump becomes president. The outgoing Obama administration has been scathing of Russia’s role in Syria. Earlier this month, the US ambassador to the UN, Samantha Power, launched a scathing attack on her Russian counterpart asking him if he was “incapable of feeling shame”.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Home Office urged to reform residency process by frustrated EU citizens", "content": "A campaign group representing EU nationals living in the UK has urged ministers to reform Home Office permanent residency procedures after it emerged people were being told to prepare to leave because of minor paperwork issues. Representatives of the3million said the case of Monique Hawkins, a Dutch woman who has lived in the UK for 24 years but received a Home Office letter advising her to make preparations to leave, showed the application process was too complex. “We need reform of the system, this is a massive bureaucratic task,” said Nicolas Hatton, a French citizen and founder of the grassroots organisation campaigning for the rights of EU citizens. German neuroscientist also told to leave UK after residency rejection Read more “This is just one example of the numbers of people who are getting rejection letters. This is happening every day. I think the point here is that we have got a system that does not work, it cannot deal with the registration of three million people. It is a massive bureaucratic task that even the government has got to realise has to be addressed.” The more than three million EU nationals living in the UK are not required to register their presence in the country but many have rushed to apply for permanent residency as a way of guaranteeing their rights after Brexit. But growing numbers complain they are being erroneously rejected. The immigration lawyer Jan Doerfel criticised what he called the “refusal mindset” at the Home Office. “Hawkins’s case highlights the tick-box exercise approach of the Home Office,” he said. “There is definitely a refusal mindset whereby any ambiguity is resolved against the candidate. When they haven’t got a yes/no answer they move to reject.” The Tory MP Dominic Raab, who intervened on Hawkins’s behalf, said he thought EU nationals who were settled in the UK before the referendum should be protected but that other EU countries had to agree to reciprocate. “I have always made clear I believe we should protect the rights of existing EU nationals here at the time of the referendum, and it has been the EU that rebuffed the early UK efforts to provide reciprocal clarity on this,” said Raab, who supported leave. The Home Office has issued statements since the referendum telling EU citizens that their status in the UK has not changed. But it has been inundated with permanent residency applications from EU nationals who fear their rights will be eroded post Brexit. The number of outstanding applications went from 37,618 in June 2015 to almost 100,000 “currently in progress” in July 2016, including those seeking permanent residence cards and documents for non-EU family members of European citizens. Earlier this week, the Guardian revealed that Hawkins had her application for permanent residency rejected because she included a solicitor-certified copy of her passport rather than the original, which she said she needed for travelling to the Netherlands to handle the paperwork generated by the death or her father. “As you appear to have no alternative basis of stay in the United Kingdom you should now make arrangements to leave,” Hawkins’s rejection letter stated. The Cambridge University graduate is married to a British man and they have two British children. She decided to apply for permanent residency after the referendum. Hawkins said she never thought she would be deported but when she phoned the Home Office to discuss the decision communicated to her in October, four months after her application, she was told her case could not be discussed on the phone or by email. She described her treatment by the Home Office as being as absurd as a Monty Python sketch. She has reapplied after obtaining a Dutch identity card, which allowed her to submit her passport. A German national, Lars Graefe, who has been in the UK since 1988, received a similar letter. An aerospace executive, he travels every week and said he could not surrender his passport for the six-month period it can take the Home Office to process applications. “Clearly the Home Office don’t know how to deal with EU citizens,” he said. “If you were in the private sector and treated customers like this you would be sacked.” Doerfel called for a review of the Home Office procedures and a return to more practical practices. “What we need is for the Home Office to go back to the system in the 1970s, 80s and even the 1990s where case workers engaged with applicants and contacted them if issues arose, that would resolve things so much quicker than this idea of refusing and then appealing. It would be cheaper for the state, more humane and probably [result in] quicker resolution of immigration applications,” he said.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Deli-plomacy: New York's famous Katz's Deli bemoans loss of Carnegie rival", "content": "Old-time delicatessens and diners are disappearing so fast in New York that the imminent loss of one of the city’s most notable, down-home eateries is being publicly mourned by another that could ordinarily be considered an arch rival. The Carnegie Deli in midtown Manhattan, a legendary business in the city and just steps away from the renowned, eponymous concert hall after which it is named, will serve its last pastrami on rye on New Year’s Eve, after more than 80 years. As regulars and tourists lined up in high emotion for hours this week to savor one last bowl of matzo ball soup or helping of latkes, the young boss of its downtown fellow icon, Katz’s Deli, has marked its imminent loss. “The Carnegie Deli will shut its doors for the last time on December 31 and we New Yorkers have already started mourning,” wrote Jake Dell in a letter to the New York Times published on Thursday. Dell owns the internationally renowned Katz’s in Manhattan’s Lower East Side neighborhood. The corner establishment is almost 120 years old and famous for its signs exhorting wartime families to “send a salami to your boy in the army”, its cameo in the film When Harry Met Sally, a confusing ticketing system and epic Jewish food staples served in no-frills surroundings. “I am deeply saddened to witness the disappearance of a fellow culinary landmark,” Dell wrote about the Carnegie Deli. A little younger than Katz’s, the Carnegie has long drawn the theater crowd to its spot on Seventh Avenue, not far from Times Square, where paneled walls in warren-like dining areas are crowded with signed pictures of the stars who have enjoyed its overstuffed reuben sandwiches or slices of brisket over the years. “Deli is about brining … patience … preservation, not just of meat but of tradition,” Dell wrote. The nearby Stage Deli preceded Carnegie out of Midtown four years ago when it closed, and the classic Second Avenue Deli left its old East Village spot a decade ago. Meanwhile, vintage American diners are also departing the city relentlessly and now number in the couple of hundreds where they used to exceed a thousand, and the traditional neon shop signs that brighten the nights in “the city that never sleeps” are disappearing along with them. The Carnegie Deli had experienced a mind-boggling variety of financial hurdles in recent times, from a pay dispute to a safety crackdown and even a contentious divorce among the ownership. But Katz’s Dell also pointed out that while businesses cherish the bustle of New York City, they also “agonize over the nonstop gentrification when we lose too many of our classics … as we wistfully watch yet another great legend fall by the wayside”. Celebrated chef Anthony Bourdain lists Katz’s and the classic smoked fish and bagel emporium, Russ & Daughters, nearby on Houston Street, among his favorite city eateries. So Dell had a promise on Thursday “to deli lovers the world over”: he plans to open another branch in Brooklyn this spring and the original business is continuing to expand its delivery and mail order services, in addition to packing them in around the plain tables for pickles and pastrami from breakfast time to the wee hours. “Katz’s is not going anywhere,” he wrote.

{ "title":"The Guardian view on the US and Israel: late, but necessary", "content": "The last-ditch intervention in the Israel-Palestine conflict by Barack Obama’s administration is imbued with a sense of eleventh-hour desperation. It is still worth assessing on its merits. Benjamin Netanyahu, settler movement leaders and others have already dismissed John Kerry’s speech on Wednesday as hostile to Israel, just as they did the UN security council resolution demanding a halt to all settlement in the occupied territories. But, as many within Israel and the Jewish diaspora have made clear, that is unfair. True, they are anti-settlement, anti-occupation and, in the case of Wednesday’s remarks, anti-Netanyahu – but also pro-Israel. As the US secretary of state observed, the growth of settlements is destroying the two-state solution, for so long viewed as the best way to defend Israel. Mr Kerry’s speech, which also criticised the Palestinian leadership, was the most outspoken attack on Israeli government policy made by a senior US official for years. That does not mean that Mr Obama’s administration has veered from longstanding US policy; he has been less willing than predecessors to allow through critical UN resolutions and has pledged $38bn in military aid over the next decade. It reflects the shift in Israel’s coalition towards what the secretary of state called “the most rightwing in Israeli history”. He said it was a time to stand up for what is right; but the sensible principles for negotiations were in essence those he drew up in March 2014. He reportedly thinks they should have been tabled formally, and wanted to make this speech that year. That would have been a braver and bolder move. Remarks made as the administration exits, with no need to ponder electoral risks, inevitably carry far less weight; but with the continuing expansion of settlements, the changes on the ground matter as much. Mr Kerry’s commitment to winning peace has been measurable in air miles and hours of meetings. But the administration has been timid, perhaps prioritising the Iran nuclear deal as his priority, and fearing the domestic damage that Mr Netanyahu could cause him and his party. The Arab spring and its fallout still consumes much of the government’s attention; today’s ceasefire in Syria gives little hope of a lasting settlement there. Meanwhile, Mr Netanyahu has paid only lip service to the two-state solution. His dismal ambition – rather than, as predecessors have sought to do, finishing David Ben-Gurion’s project by settling the country’s borders – appears simply to be outlasting Mr Ben-Gurion as the country’s longest-serving prime minister. Some have already suggested that the criminal investigation he now faces fuelled the vehemence of his reaction. The Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, meanwhile, reportedly promised to respond to the 2014 proposals but has never done so. For all these reasons it is unsurprising that both the chief foreign envoy of the Yesha council, representing Israeli settlers, and the Palestinian-American co-founder of the Electronic Intifada website described Mr Kerry’s address as an eloquent eulogy to the two-state solution. Polls suggest only a very slim majority of Israelis and Palestinians still support that outcome; a growing number believe it is no longer possible. “Stay strong Israel, January 20th is fast approaching!” Donald Trump tweeted after Mr Kerry’s speech. He has already vowed to move the US embassy to Jerusalem, a move likely to inflame the conflict, and has chosen an ambassador notable for his hardline pro-settlement stance and strong opposition to the two-state solution. On the other hand, Mr Trump’s choice for secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, has little public record on the issue, and ties to oil producers in the Gulf; and the president-elect characterises a peace agreement as “the mother of all deals”. No doubt his vanity would relish such a triumph, but the futile peace talks to date have required almost infinite amounts of patience and persistence. Mr Trump has neither. His political career has been built on disruption, not conciliation. Mr Kerry’s speech is better late than never; its symbolic effect is better than none. The international community should reaffirm its commitment to the two-state solution when foreign ministers from 70 countries meet at a Middle East peace conference in Paris on 15 January. No one has a better plan. But no one expects all this to revive the process. It is about attempting to prevent a sharp turn for the worse, and if necessary to allow something to be salvaged in a post-Trump era.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Last known Wordsworth descendant joins fight to stop Lake District pylons", "content": "The last known descendant of the Romantic poet William Wordsworth is to join campaigners marching to “save the Lake District from pylons” on New Year’s Day. Ninety pylons the height of Nelson’s column are planned across an estuary in the area of outstanding natural beauty where Wordsworth wandered lonely as a cloud. Christopher Wordsworth, great-great-great-great-grandson of the poet, is fighting a £2.8bn plan to “fence in” the scenic Lake District. National Grid wants to link the proposed nuclear plant at Moorside near Sellafield, Cumbria, to the UK power network at the Heysham power station in Morecambe. After agreeing not to place 47-metre-high pylons all the way through the Lake District national park, the utility giant proposed a £460m plan to run cables underground. However, that will still see pylons placed along a two-mile (3.3km) stretch in Whicham valley, just 10 metres from the boundary of the national park. Campaigners say the line of pylons will also run right across the top of the Duddon estuary, interrupting stunning views into and out of the high fells of the Lake District, scarring a cherished landscape steeped in history. Christopher Wordsworth said: “William Wordsworth was enthralled by the unique beauty of the Duddon, which inspired his famous series of sonnets. “As much as the works of my ancestor are an important part of our literary heritage, his ‘long-loved Duddon’ is an important part of our natural heritage. We owe it to his memory to preserve its beauty for future generations to enjoy.” The MP John Woodcock will also join the New Year’s Day walk with environmental campaigners carrying banners and placards highlighting opposition to the plans. Woodcock said: “In more than six years of representing the people of Barrow and Furness, few campaigns I have been involved in have stirred as much passion as this fight to protect the beauty of our landscape from these giant pylons. “National Grid has said it will listen to the views of local people and we need to demonstrate our strength of feeling ahead of the public consultation. “Our campaign has received the backing of the Broughton-based CGP textbook publishing company which is placing full-page advertisements in the local and national press on a series of dates around the Christmas period and we are all looking forward to the walk.” The landscape charity Friends of the Lake District and campaign group Power Without Pylons have joined forces to fight the plan. They have asked National Grid to adopt an alternative solution, which would remove the need to take the power cables up the valley and around the estuary. Friends of the Lake District is urging local people to take part in a consultation, which ends on 6 January. Dr Kate Willshaw, policy officer at Friends of the Lake District, said: “We need as many people as possible to tell National Grid that putting pylons just metres outside of the national park’s south-western boundary will cause unacceptable damage, destroying the special qualities of the national park and interrupting people’s enjoyment of our beautiful landscape renowned throughout the world.” National Grid claims it is proposing extensive measures to reduce the impact of the project on the landscape of Cumbria while balancing this with the need to keep energy bills affordable. The company aims to submit an application for consent to build the new connection to the Planning Inspectorate in 2017. A decision will then be made by the secretary of state for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy. If consent is granted, construction work is expected to start in 2019. Graham Barron, secretary of Power Without Pylons, said: “Protecting this important area is not just a local issue but a national issue. “More than 40 million people visit Cumbria each year to enjoy these special landscapes. They don’t want them scarred by lumps of metal and unsightly overhead wires. “There are feasible alternatives to pylons which we have campaigned for from the outset. If enough people state their objections to giant pylons in writing we believe the wall of opposition will force National Grid to reconsider.” The author Bill Bryson, who has also joined the campaign, said: “Britain’s countryside doesn’t stop being glorious at the boundaries of its national parks. It is beautiful – and vulnerable – nearly everywhere, and should be respected and cherished wherever it enhances a landscape. It would be a tragedy to lose these exquisite views just for the sake of one company’s bottom line.” Earlier this year, a wave of protests helped stop the North West Coast Connections project, which intended to install pylons through the Lake District. National Grid confirmed that it would now put 14 miles of cables underground, running through the western side of the national park. A National Grid spokeswoman said: “We have had to make some difficult choices about landscapes outside the national park but we believe that we can reduce the impact on them by sensitive placement of pylons and screening.” She added: “We have had thousands of conversations with people over the six years we’ve been developing this project and Friends of the Lake District have attended many of the meetings we held to develop our proposals with local authorities and other key bodies. “We have spoken to hundreds more people about our plans during our current consultation exercise. This continues until 6 January 2017 and we encourage people to give us their feedback as this will be vital in helping us shape the project.”",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"BBC helpline sees 26,000 people seek domestic abuse advice", "content": "Almost 26,000 people sought advice about domestic abuse from the BBC over the phone and online in 2016, driven by a gripping storyline on The Archers and the BBC1 documentary Behind Closed Doors. Helen Titchener’s abuse by husband Rob in The Archers also covered issues including sexual abuse, emotional distress and self-harm, and culminated in her being acquitted of attempted murder. It prompted 635 people to call the Action Line service, almost three times the largest number of calls for any single storyline on a programme between 2012 and 2015. In total, 24,400 people visited the service’s webpages on domestic abuse and more than 1,350 called for advice during the year. A donation page inspired by the storyline to raise money for a rescue fund for women suffering domestic abuse raised more than £135,000 over seven months. Louiza Patikas, who plays Helen Titchener, said: “As part of my research into this storyline, I met victims of domestic violence and coercive control, and soon learned that abuse can happen to anyone. The BBC Action Line is so important, both for victims of abuse and for the people who support them, so they have somewhere to go for advice and help.” The Action Line number, shown at the end of BBC programmes dealing with issues that may affect viewers’ lives, was set up in 1995; during 2016 there were more than 500 on-air trailers for the service. In total, more than 24,000 people called the BBC Action Line over the year for advice on issues including domestic violence, cancer and dementia, and there were more than 264,000 visits to its website. The total number of calls was down slightly on last year, but the number of web visits almost doubled. The BBC’s dementia season led to a larger number of calls than The Archers, with almost 700 people getting in touch by phone and 8,784 visits to a dedicated webpage. More than 3,900 people called about emotional distress prompted by programmes such as Panorama and EastEnders, and more than 1,400 people called about sexual abuse. Keith Jones from the BBC’s Audience Services division said: “The BBC is committed to covering challenging topics and bringing them to the attention of our audiences, but it’s also vital that we provide the off-air information to help them, in partnership with the many organisations around the UK that can provide support and are willing to do so.”",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"A new year that changed me: my partner said I would publish a book – so I had to", "content": "Sixteen years ago, long before there was any prospect of my work being published, I dreamed that I found a small book lying in the gutter directly outside my front door. The cover was the deep colour of blackcurrants and the words were in lemon yellow. I picked it up and read the title: Rare London Cheeses. To my amazement I saw that it was a collection of poems written by me. At that point I’d woken up and stretched out my hand to the bedside table where I expected to find it. My disappointment, though intense, was tinged with promise, even a sort of serenity. It was as if my poems had already been written. Fast forward to New Year’s Day 2005. Up at the crack. Prepared lavish food with Dave, my new man, at his house in West Sussex and covered the dishes in foil. Drove into London to my flat in Hackney, behind the Empire theatre. Climbed the 78 steps to the top of my block hauling bags and boxes and got the room ready to welcome my guests, most of whom were friends from various poetry-writing groups. People sat chatting, eating and drinking and at some time in the afternoon started talking about their New Year resolutions. When it came to my turn, Dave jumped in ahead of me, announcing out of the blue that I was going to have a book published. Was I? My friend and poetry tutor, John Stammers, was there, and asked me if it was true and immediately offered his help. A year later I had a contract for a first collection with Picador. I was mad with excitement. That’s when the panic set in. I didn’t have that many poems and quite a lot of them were scrappy. Over the next few weeks, I’d get up earlier and earlier, full of resolve and deliberation to days of hideous nothingness. I’d juggle a line-break. Then I’d juggle it back again. I’d go for walks. I prayed for Rumpelstiltskin to come to my aid. I chopped and patched, I teased and stole, I panted and whimpered. I spent my days trying and failing to beat off the mad dog gnashing its teeth inside my head. I scoured my notebooks for anything and then by the application of a sort of stealthy CPR I’d pummel it back to life. Or not. I found I had embarked on what Humboldt (in Saul Bellow’s Humboldt’s Gift) calls the “frantic profession”. But that New Year’s Day had changed my life forever. There was no going back. Then I remembered my dream of the blackcurrant-coloured book. I wondered what the title might mean. I wondered at its absurdity. Had cheese ever been made in London? If so, which were the rare kinds? And as for cheese in poetry, it seems that GK Chesterton was right when he said: “Poets have been mysteriously silent on the subject of cheese.” Later I wrote a poem with that title, ploddingly taking on the words and thinking about what each one meant to me. Surprisingly, it turned out to be quite a serious poem, and although I wasn’t really aware of it at the time, I found that it dealt with matters of apprenticeship, ancestry, authorship and decay. I had a sense of moving towards the possibility of wider, larger meanings. Here is one stanza: “Cheese commands respect. It has ancestral status. It is aspirational and suggests a connoisseurship that would exasperate were it not born of greed. Be they swathed in muslin or dipped in ashes they will change your humour. And London cheeses? How can I ever say what anything is like?” The dream is as vivid as ever, the shiny cover, the feeling of the mud on my fingers when I picked it up and my delight on opening it. I’m lucky that I dream a lot. While writing this, I have been reading CK Williams’ wonderful book, Poetry and Consciousness. In it he writes: “The few poems that come more easily are intriguing to me, mostly because the labour they demanded seemed to have more to do with what was actually going on in the poem than in overcoming all the various character lapses and lacks that constitute so much of the act of writing, but also because there always seems to be a great deal more in them I wasn’t quite aware of bringing about.” I have had similar experiences and I think that some of my best poems have come about this way. I am reminded that sometimes it’s the opposite of striving that brings the most precious reward. But the opposite of striving has to be striven for.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"NHS ambulance service forces elite paramedics to take non-urgent calls", "content": "An NHS ambulance service has been accused of endangering patients’ lives by scrapping a system under which specialist paramedics responded to the most urgent 999 calls, such as strokes, heart attacks and car crashes. A leaked memo from the South East Coast ambulance service (Secamb) shows its most highly trained paramedics will have to deal with minor ailments because it cannot cope with soaring demand for care and ambulances are taking too long to reach patients. The move has angered Secamb’s 60 critical care paramedics (CCPs), who warn that lives could be lost because they are busy dealing with non-urgent callouts, such as back pain, instead of life or death emergencies. The paramedics, who have all gained a postgraduate certificate in critical care after a year’s extra study, specialise in administering drugs and performing procedures that standard ambulance crews are not trained to do, including advanced resuscitation techniques. They have saved countless lives during the 10 years the CCP system has existed. Secamb, which provides NHS ambulance services in Surrey, Sussex, Kent and north-east Hampshire, has 725 general paramedics and 90 paramedic practitioners. The latter specialise in treating patients at home so they do not have to go to A&E. In the memo sent last week, which the Guardian has obtained, Geraint Davies, the service’s acting chief executive, admitted the move “will cause some anxiety and uncertainty”. Unions representing Secamb ambulance crews have voiced deep unease and one CCP, who did not want to be named, criticised the change as “shortsighted, risky and not right”. “People will suffer because of it,” he said. “The risk is of death among patients who could have been saved, maybe because we were tied up dealing with a minor ailment such as a cold, toothache, period pain or any of the other rubbish that people dial 999 with [which obliges Secamb to respond]. “It could be that we’re with Mrs Jones who, after having back pain for four years, suddenly decides to call an ambulance about it. Secamb have kept us away from stuff like that for years; that system has worked, we have saved a lot of people as a result of that, including resuscitating people who were in effect dead, and now this.” Nigel Sweet, a Unison steward for Secamb, said: “There is always a possibility that in the case of a very serious incident such as a road traffic collision or cardiac arrest, where CCPs are crucial, they won’t be available. Instead they will be responding to a standard callout. That could threaten that patient in that situation. That’s the concern.” In his email, sent on 20 December, Davies defended the change, saying: “It is essential that we utilise all of our resources to the maximum benefit of all of our patients. “It has been agreed to remove the critical care paramedic regional cover plan and place CCPs back into the trust system status plan [general workforce]. This will mean that CCPs will now be available to respond to all categories of call.” Then, in a passage that critics say shows Davies is ignoring the evidence for continuing to let CCPs concentrate only on life or death cases, he said: “While the quality impact assessment rightly recognises the valuable clinical contribution that CCPs make to seriously ill and injured patients, the [Secamb] executive [team] felt that, while demand is high and while our response performance is poor, we could not continue with the current CCP model that, in essence, ‘holds back’ CCPs from responding to some categories of patient.” The change came into effect on Wednesday 21 December and will continue until the end of March, at which point it will be “reviewed”, he said. It is part of Secamb’s “trust recovery plan” after it was put into special measures in September. In July, the Care Quality Commission described it as inadequate and said the service’s urgent and emergency care was “unsafe”. A Secamb spokeswoman said: “We have little evidence at this stage to know whether CCPs being in the plan or out of the plan will be more or less beneficial to our patients, which is why it was felt prudent, given the challenges the trust is facing and our shortage of paramedics, to look at this.” No final decision on the role of CCPs would be taken until March, she said. On Monday, Richard Webber, Secamb’s on-call strategic incident commander, said it is “struggling” to cope with a 10% year-on-year rise in the number of 999 calls. The situation is exacerbated by the service having 138 vacancies for paramedics, up from 105 last year. Secamb was revealed in February to have secretly brought in a pilot system for three months in 2014-15, under which it delayed sending an ambulance to some 999 calls transferred from the NHS 111 telephone service so it could assess their condition. The patients involved were at the level below those deemed to be in a life-threatening condition. Jon Ashworth, the shadow health secretary, said: “In recent days I’ve been warning of the extent of the national paramedic shortage. And now we learn of the drastic action this trust is taking in order to cope. “The redirection of critical care paramedics will raise fears for patients in need of the most urgent, emergency attention and the trust must urgently explain its rationale for this decision.” A Department of Health spokesperson said: “No patient should have to wait longer than necessary for an ambulance and NHS England is working closely with the services to improve response times. We’ve recruited 2,200 more paramedics since 2010 to reduce pressure on services and have increased the number of training places this year by 60%.” Meanwhile, the British Medical Association has warned that the NHS will struggle to cope if the government fails to tackle the social care crisis. Health and social care services are “desperately trying to prop up” one another, but are “cracking under the weight”, said the BMA chair, Dr Mark Porter, in his new year message. The warning comes as analysis by the doctors’ trade union showed there will need to be £26bn of cuts from health and social care costs by 2020-21 to balance spending. Health managers in 44 areas of England have been ordered to draw up strategies, setting out how they will cut costs, change services and reduce care after the NHS ran up a record £2.45bn deficit in the past financial year.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Labour warns of teacher training crisis after targets missed again", "content": "Labour has accused the government of presiding over a crisis in teacher training after it failed to hit the necessary recruitment levels for a fifth year in a row. Not enough trainee teachers began courses in more than three-quarters of subjects, with maths, physics, design and technology, computing and business studies all falling at least 15% short of their targets. About 6,000 trainee teachers began courses after achieving a 2:2 or lower in their degree subject, and less than half of trainees are studying for their qualifications in universities, Labour said. The only subjects to meet the required recruitment levels were PE, history, biology and geography, while English and chemistry narrowly missed them. Angela Rayner, the shadow education secretary, said it amounted to a teacher training crisis that would lead to shortages. “Every year the government miss their targets and it’s subjects that are crucial to our future economy that are worst hit,” she said. “The Tories really need to get a grip on this. They are failing in their most basic job in education – providing enough teachers for our schools.” However, a spokeswoman for the Department for Education (DfE) disputed the idea of a crisis, saying the figures showed that teaching “continues to be an attractive career”. “Secondary postgraduate recruitment is at its highest level since 2011 and we have recruited more trainees in key subjects including physics, maths, modern foreign languages, biology, chemistry and geography than we did last year,” she said. “The quality of new entrants also continues to be high, with 18% of this year’s cohort again holding a first-class degree – the highest on record and up from 10% in 2010-11. This shows that teaching is as popular as ever among the most talented graduates. “But we recognise that there are challenges, which is why we are investing more than £1.3bn over this parliament so we can continue to attract the brightest and best into teaching.” Recruitment was up by 12% in maths this year compared with last year, and by 15% in physics. The National Union of Teachers has previously said there is “increasing evidence of a crisis in teacher recruitment and retention, just as the number of pupils and the demand for new teachers begins to increase sharply”. It attributed the problems in attracting new recruits to “excessive workload and attacks on pay [that] are driving away teachers”. In June, the public accounts committee criticised the DfE for having no plan for how to meet its targets and failing to understand “the difficult reality that many schools face in recruiting teachers”. Almost one-third of teachers who began their career in 2010 quit the classroom within five years of qualifying, according to government figures.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"John Kerry's Middle East plan mirrors Bill Clinton's futile end-of-term attempt", "content": "John Kerry is not the first US statesman to lay out a Middle East peace plan just as he is about to leave office. In December 2000, Bill Clinton presented a set of parameters for a two-state solution, covering the same set of daunting issues: Jerusalem, the right of return (or not) of Palestinian refugees, territorial exchange on the basis of the 1967 ceasefire line and Israeli security. Kerry defends US decision not to veto UN resolution against Israeli settlements Read more It is a reflection of the paralysis and steady demise of the peace process over the ensuing 16 years that Kerry’s principles closely resemble Clinton’s parameters. In his hour-plus speech Wednesday, Kerry went further than any previous secretary of state in spelling out the self-destructive nature of Benjamin Netanyahu’s policy for Israel’s long-term security. He used unusually blunt language to describe the nature of the present Israeli government and referred to the Arab perception of the impact of Israel’s creation on Palestinian lives, the nakba – the catastrophe. The most significant differences between Kerry’s message and Clinton’s are that Israel is explicitly accepted by its neighbours as a Jewish state in Kerry’s solution, and Jerusalem is to be shared but not divided. But the most important difference is the context in which the two frameworks are being proposed. At Camp David in July 2000 Clinton had come closer than any US president to brokering a comprehensive Israeli-Palestinian agreement, and a deal between Ehud Barak and Yasser Arafat was still possible five months later. The two sides came close again at the Taba summit in January 2001. By striking contrast, Kerry made his speech at a time when a two-state solution has been corroded into an almost abstract concept and is no longer a shared destination for both parties. As the secretary of the state noted, Netanyahu continues to pay lip service to two states, but sits at the head of a government that Kerry described as the “most right wing in Israeli history, with an agenda driven by its most extreme elements,” with an aggressive settlement-building approach that leads in the other direction – to a one-state solution. According to the New York Times, Kerry had wanted to deliver a speech like this some two years ago but was blocked by the White House, which saw little value in enraging Netanyahu. The Israeli prime minister had already shown himself willing and capable of inflicting political damage on Obama and the Democrats on their home ground. Netanyahu was indeed enraged by the speech – his office was quick to dismiss it as “biased against Israel” but he was clearly not worried. He has his eye on the near horizon. As Kerry was preparing to make the speech, the administration’s Middle East policy was trolled on Twitter by the next president. “We cannot continue to let Israel be treated with such total disdain and disrespect,” Donald Trump tweeted. “They used to have a great friend in the US, but not anymore. The beginning of the end was the horrible Iran deal, and now this (UN)! Stay strong Israel, January 20th is fast approaching!” The president-elect’s message to the Israeli government was clear: ignore Kerry’s words. The next US administration will lift any pressure over settlements. The designated US ambassador, David Friedman, Trump’s bankruptcy lawyer, is vowing to move the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, has a record of funding settlements and advocates the annexation of parts of the West Bank, aligning himself with the far right elements in the Netanyahu cabinet. Given these circumstances, the Kerry speech raises questions about what purpose it serves 23 days before he leaves his job, other than a cri de coeur at the end of long and abortive effort to make an impact on the Israeli-Palestinian impasse, and a desire perhaps to put his own imprimatur on a formal blueprint for peace. Ilan Goldenberg, a former state department official, argued the speech had a value beyond such vain motives in setting down a marker ahead of Trump’s arrival in office. “Obviously it would have been better to give this speech two or three years ago,” said Goldenberg, now director of the middle east security programme at the Centre for a New American Security. “But it is still important to get those principles out there for future negotiators to rally around.” In other words, the speech is a tidal marker before the coming of the Trump deluge, in the hope it will still have relevance if and when the flood waters recede.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Nuance needed in debate about technology’s role in children’s development", "content": "The signatories to the letter on children’s lifestyles (Screen-based lifestyle harms children’s health, 26 December) make the usual error – compounded by your selective headline – of lumping an enormous variety of cultural experience into one category: “screen-based”, which is then labelled as merely “technology”. This makes about as much sense as lumping all printed matter together under the heading of “paper-based technology”. We know that’s a silly idea because we know that printed matter includes a vast range of cultural products, from novels to cereal packets. Screen-based content is just as diverse. Instead of wringing our hands over the long-established fact that children start to access this content during their first year of life, could we start to give some informed attention to how children begin to “learn about the culture they are born into” (to quote one of the signatories to the letter) and consider the possibility that some screen-based material may be enjoyed and valued by both parents and children, and may make a serious contribution to children’s social and emotional development? Cary Bazalgette Researcher on children and moving-image media, UCL Institute of Education • The harmful nature of the screen was revealed in an experiment by neuroscientist Patricia Kuhl quoted in the National Geographic in January 2015. She taught Mandarin sounds to two groups of babies, with one group through personal interaction and with the other through video, and was astonished to find that while the first group learned extremely well, the second learned nothing whatsoever. The reason is that there was a subtle energetic exchange in the interaction between children and carer, whereas machines cannot register or transmit energy other than their own mechanical signals.

{ "title":"Dutch woman with two British children told to leave UK after 24 years", "content": "A Dutch woman who has lived in the UK for 24 years, and has two children with her British husband, has been told by the Home Office that she should make arrangements to leave the country after she applied for citizenship after the EU referendum. The story of Monique Hawkins highlights the practical difficulties faced by millions of EU citizens concerned that they will not have the right to stay in Britain post-Brexit. Hawkins had considered applying for citizenship before but decided not to as it did not confer any rights beyond her current EU rights. However, after the referendum she changed her mind, fearful that those rights would be diminished after Britain leaves the EU. European citizens marrying Britons do not automatically qualify for UK citizenship under current rules and Hawkins was concerned that if she did not apply she would be forced “to join a US-style two-hour immigration queue” while the rest of her family “sail through the UK passport lane”. Brexit: 1m EU citizens in Britain 'could be at risk of deportation' Read more In order to get citizenship, she first had to get a “permanent residency” document, which involves an 85-page application form. Hawkins said the Home Office had overlooked vital information in her submission – she was unable to supply an original of her Dutch passport because her father had recently died and she needed her passport to continue to travel to the Netherlands to support her mother. However, the department not only rejected her application but sent her a letter which took no account of her right to be in the country irrespective of their decision. “As you appear to have no alternative basis of stay in the United Kingdom you should now make arrangements to leave,” the letter said. When she phoned the Home Office to discuss the decision communicated to her in October, four months after her application, she was told her case could not be discussed on the phone or by email. Hawkins said her treatment by the Home Office was as absurd as a “Monty Python” sketch. In a written complaint, Hawkins said the worst aspect about the process was the inability to contact anyone. She wrote: “I do not believe there is any other business, organisation or even legal process in the world that would treat its customers/clients/applicants in this manner.” The software engineer, from Surrey, said she never once thought she would be deported but said her experience highlights the absurdity of the Home Office permanent residency process. She was told that under the rules she could not talk to anyone about her case and after making her written complaint she received a letter saying her complaint did not qualify as a complaint under Home Office guidelines. Facebook Twitter Pinterest A European Union passport. Photograph: Aflo/Rex/Shutterstock She also protested that while the Home Office would not discuss her case with her personally, it was willing to respond to her MP Dominic Raab, who intervened on her behalf. She has now written to appeal, but says in her complaint: “I am now left totally in limbo. I do not know how long to wait for a reply. I do not know whether my application will be reopened or not.” She was told the reason for the rejection was because she had not included her original passport. In her complaint, Hawkins points out that she included a solicitor-approved photocopy of her passport – which is permissible under the rules – plus a covering letter to explain why she could not be without her passport for the four to six months it takes to process. She said the application form included a box for reasons for not including a valid passport as long as it was due to circumstances beyond your control. “Clearly my father dying did not qualify in the Home Office’s eyes as beyond my control,” said Hawkins. Hawkins’s complaint also states that her covering letter for her original application said that she would provide her original passport once the case worker assigned to it needed to see it. EU citizens in Britain post Brexit vote: ‘I feel betrayed, not at home, sad’ Read more Hawkins, who is a software developer and the daughter of a former oil company executive, lived in several countries as a child and says the UK is the only place she feels she can call home. She studied maths at Cambridge University and settled in the UK in 1992. She lives in Surrey and has two children, aged 15 and 17. “I always used to feel I had no roots. Because of my dad’s background we used to move every five years. This is the first time I’ve laid down roots,” she said. “I had a massive shock following the referendum. I felt very stressed and suddenly felt walking down the street that the place didn’t want me any more. That feeling began to subside, but I thought I should apply for citizenship.” The application form, which includes a “flummoxing” requirement to list every absence from the UK in the past 24 years, took an entire weekend to complete, she said. “It is important to realise that in applying for permanent residency I am not gaining a right, I am only getting a document stating a right I already have,” she said. Her husband, Robert, raised another issue: that Europeans married to Britons do not have an automatic right to citizenship. “As a British citizen, I had the expectation that marrying someone from abroad would automatically give them the right to become a British citizen. That seems to be the case unless your wife happens to come from the European Union,” he said. Hawkins, who has resubmitted an application for permanent residency, said she believed her case drew attention to the “discrimination against EU/UK marriages”. The British spouse cannot sponsor their EU partner and the EU spouse has to apply on their own merits. If they have not worked and are supported by their spouse, they may not meet the selection criteria. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Our obsession with ‘good immigrants’ breeds intolerance The Home Office said: “The rights of EU nationals living in the UK remain unchanged while we are a member of the European Union. EU nationals do not require any additional documents to prove their status.” It said Hawkins’s application could not be progressed because the original ID was missing. It said since October, applications could be submitted online and it had also launched an express passport check-in service in 58 local councils around the country, including one 10 miles from Hawkins’s home. Hawkins’s case is just one of many similar experiences of EU citizens panicked into applying for permanent residency. German aerospace executive Lars Graefe, who has lived in the UK since 1998, and is married to a British woman, said he received a similar “make-preparations-to-leave” letter from the Home Office. He couldn’t surrender his passport because he travels every week and made a complaint because he too thought he satisfied the provision for not including original documentation. “The point I raised in my complaint was about the process. Even if they couldn’t verify I was German, I still qualify to remain. Clearly the Home Office don’t know how to deal with EU citizens. If you were in the private sector and treated customers like this you would be sacked,” he said.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Dave Shepherd obituary", "content": "The jazz clarinettist Dave Shepherd, who has died aged 87, was often billed as Britain’s answer to Benny Goodman, his instrumental facility, centred tone and driving attack comparable to that of his American idol. The sobriquet never rankled with Shepherd: he toured frequently with Goodman’s celebrated pianist Teddy Wilson and regularly put together whole quintet presentations (sometimes using other Goodman alumni) based on the maestro’s music. It was reported that Goodman himself once said: “He plays more like me than I do.” If Goodman’s music was often technically demanding, it never seemed to daunt Shepherd, whose style and grace in playing was mirrored by his dapper, well-groomed appearance and easy bandstand manner. “Dave was the finest swing clarinettist in the country and perhaps, in the world,” said the trumpeter Digby Fairweather, a frequent associate, adding: “He was always the most handsome man in the band.” Indeed, it was reputed that Shepherd had once modelled for Brylcreem, when it was the trendiest of male hair preparations. He was born in Walthamstow, east London, to Cecilia (nee Sadgrove), a machinist, and Joseph Shepherd, a semi-pro pianist who worked for the gas company. Dave adopted the clarinet aged 15 after seeing Freddy Mirfield’s Garbage Men, the group whose clarinettist was the young John Dankworth. Shepherd was soon proficient enough to play at gigs with the trumpeter Freddy Randall, while taking lessons from Randall’s clarinettist Bernie Izen and working as a shorthand-typist at the War Office. His national service posting in 1947 was to the British Forces Network radio station in Hamburg. The army had taken over the state opera house for their studios and this allowed Shepherd to persuade the opera’s principal clarinettist to give him a weekly lesson in exchange for 10 cigarettes a go. Shepherd played with the BFN quintet, broadcasting twice a week and practising for several hours a day, this under the benign command of Cliff Michelmore. As he said: “The army did a lot for my start in the jazz world.” Shepherd resumed work at the War Office after demobilisation in 1949 and played around London, sometimes fronting his own quartet while fitting in with any number of Dixieland-style bands. In 1951, he joined the drummer Joe Daniels and his Hot Shots, then a highly popular group, and turned professional, making his recording debut the same year. Daniels’s well-organised Dixieland approach suited Shepherd and he stayed for three years, before moving on to play with Randall again, cementing a working relationship that was revisited often over the years. Shepherd also recorded a pair of albums under his own name at this time. Despite this, and like a number of his contemporaries, he felt impelled in 1956 to try his luck in New York, then the jazzman’s mecca, taking office jobs before the union allowed him to look for musical work. Back in Britain a year later, he became part of an all-star group known as the Jazz Today Unit, playing concerts with the Gerry Mulligan quartet in April 1957. He considered this to be a career highlight, another being his presence as part of the Dill Jones quartet on the first-ever UK tour in May 1958 by the famous Jazz at the Philharmonic troupe with Ella Fitzgerald and Oscar Peterson as the star attractions. It was during this time that Shepherd began to be heard frequently on BBC radio, his quartet often used on the Jimmy Young show, or on Round Midnight or Breakfast Special, and even on Music While You Work, his limpid clarinet tone and flair for melodic invention a welcome inclusion on these popular programmes. He also toured abroad, often in eastern Germany, played the Edinburgh, Nice and Montreux festivals, and began to work regularly from 1967 with Wilson, this taking in biennial UK tours but also a couple of visits to South Africa in 1973, including a concert in Soweto. By the 1970s, he had linked up again with Randall, while still fronting his own Goodman-styled quintet. In 1980, Shepherd was recruited by the impresario Peter Boizot as a founder member and leader of the PizzaExpress All Stars, a mainstream group that played residencies at the PizzaExpress jazz club in Dean Street, Soho, several times a week over the following three decades, often with star American guests. This was especially convenient for Shepherd as he now had a job with a film production company located nearby. He moved to Hampshire in 1996, so travelled to London less often, but still carried on with the All-Stars until 2001, while fitting in dates with Fairweather’s Great British Jazz Band and playing solo gigs. He was back at Dean Street in February last year for the 35th Anniversary reunion of the All-Stars, with Boizot on hand to cheer on his veteran proteges. In 1966 he married his second wife, Mary Evans. She survives him, as does Rochelle, the daughter of his earlier marriage to the jazz vocalist Jo Searle, which ended in divorce. • David Joseph Shepherd, jazz clarinettist, born 7 February 1929; died 15 December 2016 This article was amended on 15 January 2017.

{ "title":"Nothing sings quite like a robin", "content": "The singers began rehearsing for the main event as long ago as September. At first light, the murmur of traffic would be punctuated with tentative trills or cadences that expired almost as they began. The gaps between plaintive coos of the wood pigeon were filled with sotto voce snatches of song, making up for a lack of volume with notes of high piercing intensity. There is nothing that sings quite like a robin. Robin song comes on strong at the end of the year, as if the bird were living up to its status as an emblem of the season. The simple scientific explanation is that male and female birds are re-establishing pair bonds and territorial rights. All this week, one has begun its front of house show well before dawn, while another has launched forth in answer or opposition at the back. Yesterday, befuddled by sleep, I stood up and parted the curtains in a bid to see one of these birds, only to reel back at the soupy glare of a street light. Today, I stayed in bed, clamped my eyes shut, and listened. Robin brings a touch of home to the trenches: Country diary 100 years ago Read more The factory-like swish of cars spoke of overnight rain. A voice riding higher than a soprano easily subsumed this ambient roar into the background. For 20 minutes or more, the robin uttered a sequence of 200 or so phrases, in which melodies rose out of nothing, and swept through the whole gamut between hope and despair in three or four seconds. But there was never a conclusion. Quavering runs halted and fevered cascades cut short. I counted the lulls between – one-and-two-and – then the song resumed. I wondered if the bird had one tune in its head, simply oscillating between soundlessness and vocalisation; to my ears, it was as if a badly tuned radio was dipping in and out of a complete work. For millennia, humans must have woken to robin song, in half-light without electricity, in silence without motorised vehicles. When there was no wind or rain, it would have been the only sound, a lone voice of affirmation at the dying of the year. Follow Country diary on Twitter: @gdncountrydiary",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Amazon refuses to let police access US murder suspect's Echo recordings", "content": "Amazon has refused to hand over data from an Echo smart speaker to US police, who want to access it as part of an investigation into a murder in Arkansas, according to court records seen by tech industry news site The Information. Arkansas police issued a warrant to Amazon to turn over recordings and other information associated with the device owned by James Andrew Bates. Bates has been charged with the murder of a man found dead in his hot tub in November 2015. The Seattle-based tech company twice declined to provide the police with the information they requested from the device, although it did provide Bates’s account information and purchase history, the report said court records show. Although the Echo is known for having “always-on” microphones to enable its voice-controlled features, the vast majority of the recordings it makes are not saved for longer than the few seconds it takes to determine if a pre-set “wake word” (usually “Alexa”) has been said. Only if that wake word has been heard does the device’s full complement of microphones come on and begin transmitting audio to Amazon. While that would seem to limit the use of the Echo data in the investigation, the device is also occasionally accidentally activated, through similar sounds. Those snippets of audio could potentially be useful to police investigating a crime, as could the timing information of when they were recorded. According to the report, the court records show police took the Echo and extracted some data from it. US prosecutors and defence attorneys have both found new uses for “smart” device data in the courtroom in recent years, especially information collected by wristwatch-style Fitbit activity trackers. In 2014, a Canadian woman sued her former employer over a debilitating injury she claimed to have sustained during her work as a personal trainer; she submitted data from her Fitbit to prove that “her activity levels are still lower than the baseline for someone of her age and profession,” according to reports. Conversely, when a Florida woman claimed an intruder had assaulted her, police used information from a Fitbit she had been wearing during the alleged assault that suggested she had in fact been asleep at time. She was subsequently charged with filing a false report. Amazon’s reluctance to part with user information fits a familiar pattern. Tech companies often see law enforcement requests for data as invasive and damaging to an industry that considers privacy a prime selling point. Last year, Apple went to court with the FBI over the bureau’s demand that that company break its own encryption on an iPhone belonging to one of the shooters in the San Bernardino spree killing. But firms often retain a “back door” for their own use – to automatically scan emails for key terms used to target advertising, for example – and that can complicate claims that law enforcement access would uniquely invade a user’s privacy. Amazon’s internal approach to user data will likely prove integral to its ability to resist the warrant. In the Echo case, police also extracted data from a different smart home device, a water meter. Bates’ smart water meter recorded a flow of 140 gallons between 1am and 3am, the report said. Prosecutors claim this is an unfeasibly large amount of water use, and allege it was the result of the garden hose being used to spray the patio clean of blood. Bates’s defence team disputes the accuracy of the readings. Bates pleaded not guilty in April 2016 and is on bail awaiting trial early next year.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"The toothless United Nations must seize this last chance to save itself", "content": "As the Syrian government and its backers tighten their grip on Aleppo, and Turkey and Russia reveal yet another ceasefire in Syria, the same questions trouble many an outraged onlooker. Has the United Nations ever seemed more toothless than it does now? Why did this congregation of almost 200 countries lack the power first to prevent, and then to halt, such civilian bloodshed? Why had it been unable to convene all the parties around the same table to any productive end? And if the UN is incapable of acting in a crisis such as this, what is the point of it? António Guterres takes over as the new secretary general of the UN on Sunday at a time when the international organisation’s reputation is, at least from the perspective of many western countries, as low as it has ever been. The hopes that were invested in this successor to the failed League of Nations seem to have been dashed at the very time when they mattered most – and not for the first time. Is the former Portuguese prime minister someone who can show that the organisation has a mission that can work? Turkey and Russia 'agree terms of Syria ceasefire' Read more It is a good deal easier to forecast failure than success. After all, successes for the UN in recent years have been few and far between. Much of the peace-brokering, such as it is, has been accomplished by others, including the US and – yes – the much-maligned EU. And while there are many who blame the outgoing secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, for the UN’s lacklustre performance during his two five-year terms, this would not be entirely fair. Ban’s appointment was in large part a reaction to the perceived mismatch of profile and achievement on the part of the previous incumbent, Kofi Annan. Not only was it Asia’s turn to provide the new secretary general, but there was a widespread feeling that a less frenetic and more discreet approach might bring less discord and more results. If that was the job description, Ban certainly met the brief. So discreet a presence was he, however, that the UN, on his watch, seemed almost to fade from view. Specific failures of other UN branches – the cholera brought to Haiti during the earthquake relief operation; the disastrously late response to the west African ebola epidemic; the UN refugee agency’s non-appearance during Europe’s refugee crisis – all reinforced the impression of an “international community” with neither the will nor the capacity to cope. Then came Syria, which defeated not one, but two of the UN’s most accomplished diplomats, first Annan then Algerian Lakhdar Brahimi. Staffan de Mistura, the Italian-Swedish diplomat, deserves more credit than he has been given, not least for his steadying presence, but much of the heavy lifting was undertaken by the old cold war pairing of the US and Russia – ultimately to little effect. Facebook Twitter Pinterest New UN secretary general Ant ónio Guterres Photograph: ddp USA/Rex Features All of which helps to explain why, as Ban completed his farewell calls, it was not just his own near traceless tenure that came in for criticism, but the UN’s long-term record in general. Perhaps the time for a world body had simply passed. Such criticism, however, ignores the crucial fact: the UN is no more and no less than the 193 countries that belong to it. It is not the independent arbiter many assume it to be, and conflicts – especially once there has been resort to arms – are not simple to resolve. Civil wars, with or without outside involvement, are especially intractable – as in Syria. The UN has a second chance to come into its own. But it must think in terms of the politics of 2045 rather than 1945 The collapse of the Soviet Union had spurred hopes for a more consensual security council that would be less inhibited about acting. Twenty-five years on, though, it is clear that it is not only the enduring cold war legacy that stands in the way of agreement at the top of the UN. There is the newer north-south dimension, the old smattering of colonial grievances, but most of all some genuinely irreconcilable territorial and cultural interests. It might be tempting to propose that the UN should just give up and leave the field. As of now, however, that looks a much worse idea than pressing on. One reason is the new secretary general. Guterres has the record and personal energy that could just put the UN back on to the global diplomatic map. Another is the new US president. If Donald Trump is serious about downgrading US internationalism, this could leave a gap that the UN would be equipped to fill – perhaps even with US blessing. A third reason, though, is the most compelling. Even before Trump, the world was already becoming a more contested place, with China fast becoming an assertive new player, India snapping at its heels, and the Middle East conflict entailing much more than Israel-Palestine. Just as the G20 has largely superseded the G7 for economic discussions, so the UN, with its worldwide membership, has a second chance to come into its own. It will need to be less hierarchical, in line with the flatter organisational structures favoured today. It should perhaps have its own standing security force (to be deployed only by consent). Above all, it will have to think in terms of the politics and demography of 2045, rather than 1945. Whether any of this can happen will rest to a large extent with Guterres. But if, as it would appear, the diplomacy of tomorrow is likely to be more multilateral than it is today, the UN should be an idea whose time has come rather than gone.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"FTSE 100 soars to new closing high", "content": "Britain’s blue-chip share index has soared to a new all-time closing high powered by soaring confidence in the US, a surge in the share prices of mining companies and the impact of the falling pound. On the first day’s trading after the Christmas break the FTSE 100 index of the biggest listed companies in London jumped by 37 points, or 0.5%, to close at 7,106.08 points on Wednesday night, two points above the previous high set in April 2015. Traders said the rally was the result of optimism in the American economy, with data earlier this week showing consumer confidence in the US had hit a 15-year high. Investors are also anticipating a surge in US government spending, with president-elect Donald Trump having pledged a new $1tn fiscal stimulus programme once he takes office. Mining companies led the way, with their shares jumping in quiet trading, on the first session since the Christmas holidays. Silver producer Fresnillo leapt 5.2%, gold miner Randgold gained 4.8%, while mining giant BHP Billiton rose 4.2% and Anglo American picked up 3.5%. Major international firms benefited from the weak pound, which fell to a two-month low of $1.222 against the US dollar. With just two sessions to go, the FTSE-100 has now gained 13% since the start of 2016, despite a series of market shocks including the Brexit referendum result and the US election. That rise means the worth of the 100 most valuable companies listed in London has jumped by about £230bn this year. Mining shares have been the star performers in 2016, after suffering major losses in 2015 when commodity prices crashed. This year, the prices of oil, iron ore, copper, nickel and coal have all risen, as fears that China would suffer an economic “hard landing” have eased. Trump’s vow to rebuild America’s highways, schools and airports has also driven up commodity prices. Anglo’s shares have almost quadrupled in value this year, highlighting how 2016 has been the best year for mining companies since 2009. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, says mining firms have made a “remarkable comeback” over the past 12 months. “Small losses are the order of the day across most stock markets today, but London’s traders have evidently come back from Christmas with a festive bounce in their step. The FTSE 100 is the star performer today, helped on its way higher by an excellent turn from the index’s mining contingent,” Beauchamp explains. Energy stocks also gained ground, after the price of oil traded near one-year high. Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets said shares were boosted by “gains by oil and optimism regarding what Trump can do for the economy following his inauguration in a few weeks time.” David Cheetham, market analyst at online trading group XTB, said shares typically rally in the quiet period at the end of a year. “Observers of the markets have for many years noticed a strong propensity for stocks to rise in the period between Christmas and the New Year and this phenomenon appears to be playing out once more,” Cheetham said. These increases are known as a “Santa rally” by City workers. The FTSE 100 is now just 23 points shy of its all-time intraday high, set in October. The index has gained 12% since the EU referendum in June, despite fears that a vote for Brexit would derail the economy. However, the FTSE 100 is priced in sterling, which has tumbled by 17% against the US dollar. This has made Britain’s companies particularly attractive to US investors, helping to push up share prices. The FTSE 250 index, which contains medium-sized UK companies, also rose on Wednesday, gaining 0.5%. But it is only up 3% for 2016, substantially lagging the internationally-focused FTSE 100. Wall Street was unable to follow the City’s lead by setting its own record highs. The Dow Jones industrial average faltered in morning trading, dropping by 0.4% to 19,863, dashing hopes that it might finally crash through the 20,000 point mark for the first time ever. Some investors are also bracing for fresh volatility in 2017, with a Trump presidency and the triggering of formal Brexit negotiations likely to rock markets next year.

{ "title":"Theresa May 'lacks courage to admit complexity of Brexit'", "content": "Theresa May is struggling to summon enough political courage to admit there will be difficulties in Britain’s exit from the European Union, according to the head of the senior civil servants’ union. Dave Penman, general secretary of the FDA, said the prime minister’s inability to talk openly about the complexity of Brexit could lead to a breaking point in Whitehall as staff struggle with an immense workload on limited resources. Civil servants across government departments are preparing for May to trigger article 50 in March, launching the Brexit process. Leaked Brexit memo: Whitehall struggling to cope and no single plan Read more Penman, who represents senior civil servants – who cannot speak directly to the media – said May appeared to be leading a government that could not cope with any discussion about problems of implementation, as it was interpreted as criticism. He said: “It is pure politics that is defining the Brexit debate and forcing May to say this is not a big, difficult job, and it is all in hand. Ministers lack the political courage to admit how complex and time-consuming this will be. When anyone pops their head above the parapet – former permanent secretaries, ex-cabinet secretaries, the Institute for Government – and says this is going to take a long time and it’s complex, they are immediately shot down and accused of betraying the will of the people. “The politics around Brexit are the biggest risk to Brexit. The government is clearly in a situation where they are trying to deny the complexity of it.” The FDA’s 19,000 members are at the forefront of the work within Whitehall as Britain prepares to leave the EU. Some of those who have been criticised for highlighting the challenges include Gus O’Donnell, a former cabinet secretary, John Manzoni, the Cabinet Office permanent secretary, Simon Fraser, a former Foreign Office permanent under-secretary, and Bob Kerslake, a former head of the civil service. Penman, who has held many discussions with senior mandarins involved in developing a Brexit strategy, said May and her ministers would have to make difficult decisions about priorities in the coming months. “The civil service is either going to have to be given more resources to deal with Brexit and its usual work or it will have to change its priorities. And government doesn’t want to admit to either,” he said. “Ministers don’t want to admit that this work and the choices are complex because it doesn’t play well politically and they don’t want to make hard choices around priorities. But something has got to give.” Penman, 49, defies the stereotype of a Whitehall mandarin who has emerged from a top public school and moved seamlessly to Oxbridge before being fast-tracked into an office of state. He left school in Cumbernauld, Scotland, at 18 to join the local civil service. He was recently re-elected unopposed as the FDA’s general secretary to serve for a second five-year term. Penman said the government may have to drop some of its priorities or increase the resources given to the civil service. He pointed out that only two ministries – Liam Fox’s international trade department and the Foreign Office – had been given extra resources, while others were dealing with Brexit, a cuts programme and trying to implement a domestic agenda at the same time. “To some degree civil servants are used to this process – government has for many years been about giving the civil service less money, not more. But what is unique this time is the scale, the complexity and the politics of it all,” he said. The Home Office and the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs were facing a particularly difficult time this coming year, he said. About 1,200 EU laws, one-quarter of the total, relate to Defra, which distributes £3bn of EU money to farmers, and oversees fishing quotas and water quality. “Defra is going to be 35%-40% smaller in 2019 than it was in 2010. Its ability to cope with supporting the government’s negotiations around key policy areas for it, plus dealing with what day one outside of the EU looks like, is an enormous challenge. Andrea Leadsom [the environment secretary] is going to have to make some choices,” he said. Departments were bracing themselves for ministerial initiatives that would be increasingly difficult to implement because Brexit would require so much of the staff’s time and resources, he said. Some staff within the Home Office were shocked when the home secretary, Amber Rudd, told the Conservative party conference in September that she would force firms to identify their foreign workers. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Home secretary Amber Rudd targets immigration and foreign workers Penman said the plan had prompted some anxiety among officials because it would have taken dozens of staff away from Brexit planning for many months to make such a scheme work properly. “When they dreamed up this idea of setting up a register of EU nationals, there was panic in the Home Office because the civil servants understood the complexity and the time and resource required to do something like that,” he said. Ministers would in time be forced to drop some non-Brexit initiatives, Penman predicted. “Either Brexit is not going to be funded and resourced or the PM is going to have to drop something. Something is going to have to give, and it is not going to be Brexit. “Brexit dominates everything right now – the politics and the civil service and everyone is focused on the great repeal bill and article 50. All the government is doing right now is preparing the ground for the negotiating process. “The civil service will have to effectively run a Formula One car whilst building next year’s car at the same time. It can be done, but it’s going to be a bumpy ride.” Penman’s intervention came as a report by Migration Watch UK claimed that immigration from the EU will remain high if Britain stays in the European single market after Brexit. It estimated if that in that scenario the UK’s scope to reduce net migration from the bloc from its current 189,000-a-year level would be “extremely limited” and it would be unlikely to fall below 155,000 a year in the medium term.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"The Guardian view on English local identities: a clash of cash against community", "content": "Is Derbyshire in the north of England or the Midlands? The question is as old as the redrawing of the map of England following the Norman conquest. But it is no longer such a parochial or academic question as it may seem. Derbyshire’s dilemmas now illuminate what we mean by local democracy and local government in England more generally. That’s because the promotion of English city regions and the money being directed towards the northern powerhouse by the Treasury in London are making a nonsense of historic local identities as well as of England’s long but increasingly derelict traditions of locally rooted democratic municipalism. Just before Christmas, the high court backed an objection by Derbyshire county council against efforts by Chesterfield, which is in the north of the county, to attach itself to the emerging city region of Sheffield, which comprises Sheffield, Barnsley, Rotherham and Doncaster, which are all historically part of the various iterations of Yorkshire, its ridings and its more modern subdivisions. Medieval county boundaries are one thing, economic geography another | Letters Read more The court did this after Derbyshire complained that if Chesterfield were permitted to redefine itself as part of Sheffield, it would raise the question of whether the county of Derbyshire could be said to exist at all without its second largest town. The county’s case was reinforced by the fact that Chesterfield district has no actual border with Sheffield, from which it is separated by part of the North East Derbyshire district. If Chesterfield were to join Sheffield, it would become an enclave (or, from Sheffield’s viewpoint, an exclave) within its former county. It would be the Nagorno-Karabakh of the east Midlands, leaving the map of Derbyshire resembling nothing so much as a Barbara Hepworth sculpture. From a financial rather than an identity perspective, Chesterfield’s move makes a certain sort of sense. Faced with continuing financial pressures to cut, sell off or simply abandon swaths of local government services that have existed for generations, English local authorities inevitably clutch at any cash straws they can. The city regions are one of the few straws on offer. They are due to receive £30m in new funding a year and to acquire new freedoms to shape local transport, planning and economic policy. It is hardly surprising that Chesterfield’s defection was hatched and promoted at the council level, since councillors and council officers are in the frontline of struggling with these austerity-driven realities every day. While the councils did their deal, Chesterfield and Derbyshire opinion was barely considered, the high court ruled, so it must now be properly consulted and taken into account before any decision is taken. An online poll organised by the county council in August, five months after Chesterfield decided to join Sheffield, found 92% of respondents opposed to the move. Sheffield region’s bid to absorb Chesterfield faces legal setback after ruling Read more That is almost certainly because, for all its proximity to Sheffield, there has never been any serious tradition of Chesterfield regarding itself as part of Greater Sheffield, or of Sheffield seeing Chesterfield as part of South Yorkshire. Chesterfield is today what it has always been, an important town in north-east Derbyshire, famous for the twisted spire of its St Mary’s church, and for having had Tony Benn as its MP in the later period of his parliamentary career. Its possible marriage to the Sheffield city region is overwhelmingly rooted in perceived economic advantage rather than in history or public sentiment. The high court has therefore pitted economic survival against identity and democracy. The Chesterfield-Sheffield question is of far more than local interest. Local identity matters everywhere. It is tenacious. It runs deeper than the economic or administrative convenience of a bureaucrat’s pen. County identities are medieval in origin but they lurk on in many modern consciousnesses. Ministers mess with them at their peril. The argument about Derbyshire has only arisen because English local government is in such a desperate state. Austerity in the 2010s is completing the centralisation of local powers begun in the 1980s. Communities like Chesterfield are reduced to scrabbling for a share of the Treasury’s parachute drop of cash to the city regions. Ministers may talk of a new era of municipal greatness, but it is a hollow sham as long as local authorities lack effective income-raising powers. Unless and until English devolution is reconceived as regions made up from existing counties, cities and boroughs, these arguments will continue, pitting community identity and democracy against economic inequalities and distortions enforced from Whitehall.",diasaster:0},

{ "title":"Lengthy waits to see GPs may pose serious risk to patients, says top doctor", "content": "Thousands of patients could be put at serious risk of life-threatening or life-changing health problems as they wait several weeks to see family doctors, a leading GP has warned. Surgeries have been struggling to keep waiting times down during the busy winter period, with some patients waiting two or three weeks to see GPs for non-urgent matters, such as suspect lumps or bleeding problems, the chair of the Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) said. Dr Helen Stokes-Lampard said waiting times could rise to three or four weeks and such delays may cause non-urgent conditions to become acute problems. Life of a GP: 'We are crumbling under the pressures of workload' Read more Stokes-Lampard raised particular concerns over the tens of thousands of people with chronic and long-term health conditions, such as heart problems and diabetes, who may be neglected because GPs had to “firefight” patients with urgent issues. The consequences for people with such conditions could be “very serious indeed”, she added. The senior GP, based in Lichfield, Staffordshire, said she was “profoundly concerned” about how general practice would cope over winter when there is higher demand for NHS services. Although seasonal woes have been a longstanding problem in the NHS, Stokes-Lampard said attention had been focused on the impact on hospital care, when every peak in workload in A&E departments was magnified at GP surgeries, which were “already skating on thin ice”. “If you’ve got to deal with people who are acutely sick on the day, because people need help, then chronic disease management will disappear,” she said. Asked if patients with non-urgent needs would be forced to wait weeks to see their GP, she said: “Absolutely. If it’s already taking some patients two to three weeks to get in to see a GP for the non-urgent stuff, then by the time three to four weeks has passed, the non-urgent stuff may be becoming urgent. “With lumps or bleeding problems or things that could be signs of serious disease, my profound concern is that people will delay seeking help for things that could potentially be life-threatening or life-changing if they are not tackled swiftly. Extended waiting times pose a serious risk because of all those unintended consequences. “If we rein back on all that preventative care and all that chronic disease management because we are too busy firefighting the urgent stuff, the knock-on consequences could take years to manifest, but they will be very serious indeed. And that would be a tragedy.” The shadow health minister, Julie Cooper, said the situation was extremely worrying and “the government needs to wake up to the fact that there is a full-scale crisis in the NHS at every level”. “We have heard a lot about the shortage of beds and waiting times in accident and emergency departments, but there has been little acknowledgement of the pressures facing GP surgeries,” she said. “The truth is that they are overwhelmed by ever increasing demand. Add to this a chronic shortage of GPs and a crisis in recruitment, and the result is a service that is at breaking point.” An NHS England spokesman said: “Over the Christmas and new year period, the top priority has to be medical emergencies, but the RCGP are right to remind everyone of what they describe as the ‘most phenomenal success story of the NHS’ – every day tens of thousands of people do not die who would have died 20 to 30 years ago, because we are quietly saving them from having heart attacks, strokes and complications of diabetes. “That’s why GP services are on track to receive an extra £2.4bn in real terms investment by 2020 to build on this track record of success and expand access to convenient appointments throughout the week.”",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Problems with Britain’s trains", "content": "Regarding your article “Britain’s rolling stock is 21 years old on average” (28 December), I would argue that accessibility for disabled people travelling on trains is of a similar age. The staff are fantastic but the accessibility of the rolling stock is not. I am a wheelchair user who regularly travels by train. When I travel, I must book assistance to help me on and off trains. At peak times this assistance does not always happen. I mention this because in Berlin, much of the rail system provides level access on to the trains. This enables wheelchair users who can to use the train independently. This is something I hope will be looked at in the new design of trains and stations. I regularly use both the east and west coast mainlines to visit family. My partner and I are both in electric wheelchairs and cannot transfer to companion seats. Most carriages only have a single wheelchair space so we can’t sit together. With innovative design, train companies could have dual-purpose spaces that allow for wheelchair users when needed and can also be accessed by non-disabled passengers when there are no wheelchair users travelling. This would enable multiple wheelchair users to travel together. The DfT spokesman mentioned the biggest modernisation programme in a century to improve the number of seats and Wi-Fi access. It should also address disabled access, or disabled people will continue to receive a standard class service on what will be a first-class railway system.

The work done by Servest teams to make sure our trains are clean, presentable and comfortable is very important to us and our customers, and is just as important that their staff are properly rewarded for the work they do. The relationship between Servest and its employees should rightly be between them but GWR is not an uninterested party here, and we have built a number of key protections into our contracts with suppliers to make sure their staff are treated fairly and with respect. For example, staff of contractors cleaning GWR trains (and any agency staff working on their behalf) must receive the living wage – or the London living wage where appropriate – as a minimum standard. In addition, they receive at least 28 days’ paid leave a year, zero-hours contracts are banned, and we give each of them five days’ free travel on our trains a year.

{ "title":"Climate change driving birds to migrate early, research reveals", "content": "Migrating birds are responding to the effects of climate change by arriving at their breeding grounds earlier as global temperatures rise, research has found. The University of Edinburgh study, which looked at hundreds of species across five continents, found that birds are reaching their summer breeding grounds on average about one day earlier per degree of increasing global temperature. The main reason birds take flight is changing seasonal temperatures and food availability. The time they reach their summer breeding grounds is significant, because arriving at the wrong time, even by a few days, may cause them to miss out on vital resources such as food and nesting places. This in turn affects the timing of offspring hatching and their chances of survival. The Guardian view on climate change: bad for the Arctic | Editorial Read more The research included species that travel huge distances, such as the swallow and pied flycatcher, as well as those with shorter migrations, such as the lapwing and pied wagtail. British swallows fly through western France, across the Pyrenees, down eastern Spain into Morocco, and across the Sahara, to spend their winter in South Africa from around September or October. Migrating swallows can cover 200 miles a day at speeds of 17-22 miles per hour, with a maximum flight speed of 35mph. The pied flycatcher, a bird slightly smaller than a house sparrow, is a summer visitor to the UK and breeds mainly in western areas of the country, before spending the winter in west Africa. The northern lapwing, which is about 30cm long from beak to tail, can be seen across the British Isles throughout the year, favouring farmland, wetland and meadows during the breeding season and pasture and ploughed fields during the winter months. The University of Edinburgh researchers examined records of migrating bird species dating back almost 300 years. They drew upon records from amateur enthusiasts and scientists, including notes from 19th-century American naturalist Henry David Thoreau. They hope their study, published in the Journal of Animal Ecology and supported by the Natural Environment Research Council, will help scientists better predict how different species will respond to environmental changes. Long-distance migrants, which are shown to be less responsive to rising temperatures, may suffer most as other birds gain advantage by arriving at breeding grounds ahead of them. Takuji Usui, of the university’s school of biological sciences, said: “Many plant and animal species are altering the timing of activities associated with the start of spring, such as flowering and breeding. “Now we have detailed insights into how the timing of migration is changing and how this change varies across species. These insights may help us predict how well migratory birds keep up with changing conditions on their breeding grounds.”",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"People voted Brexit. But Cameron, Blair and other flawed leaders made it possible", "content": "The usual view of history for left-leaning liberals is that the character of the leading protagonists is secondary. The real drivers of history are socio-economic forces. Marxist views of history, which I imbibed as an undergraduate, take this further: history is determined by material conditions – wages, working conditions, social relations. But in moments of crisis, such as the EU referendum and its consequences, personality flaws really do matter. When events are finely balanced, what this or that individual does can make all the difference. We need a mature Brexit debate – we’re not getting it from Michael Gove | Jonathan Portes Read more The consensus about the Brexit vote is that it expressed resentment about how politicians had driven forward social changes without the consent of the affected communities. So social forces were certainly important. But in an extraordinary year where the right gained the upper hand and effective opposition disintegrated, what’s striking is how many fatal twists and turns were set in motion by misjudgments based on the character flaws of the leaders. Without the hubris, arrogance, laziness, disloyalty, connivance and opportunism of so many of the key players, we would probably not be in this current state of Brexit-induced political mess. How far back should we go with this idea that misjudgments based on character flaws led directly to this mess? A long way. Tony Blair’s hubris about the Middle East discredited his centre-left politics. The fratricidal competitiveness of Ed Milliband helped to deprive Labour of victory and a platform to rebuild the centre-left. Also key in the 2015 election was Nick Clegg’s duplicity around student fees. His class chemistry with David Cameron and his evident liking for his position caused him to massively disappoint his voters – a move that in effect wiped out the Liberal Democrats. Facebook Twitter Pinterest 2016: How do you report a year that changed the world? – video This left Cameron unchallenged except by his own right wing. And of all the personality flaws in this saga, his proved the most glaring. His laziness and lack of attention to detail, characterised by the press as “Dave’s chillaxing”, made him supremely confident about the referendum. He thought he could face down the right relying on electoral “reasonableness”. This relaxed attitude was fatal. The stakes were too high, and the details about the referendum’s status really mattered, as the ensuing muddle revealed. Cameron’s failure to see danger coming allowed a motivated right wing to define the agenda. The weeks following the vote was a period many commentators described as a Greek tragedy, which is all about character initiating a fatal sequence of events. Michael Gove and Boris Johnson appeared motivated more by manoeuvring for leadership than deep conviction, as well as being deluded about their own strategic cleverness. But Johnson was rather too good at connecting with the popular mood, at turning the perfect phrase, at echoing and, to some extent, manipulating the popular press, and got the result he almost certainly didn’t want. His stricken face on Brexit morning suggested he had really sought to be the “unifying” leader in a close remain vote. Gove’s downfall came from opportunism, disloyalty, and an overestimation of his ability to outmanoeuvre Johnson. Trump’s latest tweet about nuclear weapons is both daft and dangerous | Simon Jenkins Read more Of course politicians’ characters are always crucial factors in determining the direction of events, and politicians by nature probably have a larger dose of personal ambition and cunning than the average citizen. In robust circumstances when political checks and balances are working well, where attention is given to detail, and where a strong opposition is able to articulate public concerns, then leaders’ character traits and even flaws don’t matter so much. But the Brexit negotiations are finely balanced, and the public is being offered little chance of scrutinising decisions. The current leaders look even more flawed than those whose misjudgments led us to this point. We now have a secretive and controlling prime minister in charge of the biggest team of negotiators to be assembled since the 1945 peace conferences. For a negotiation unwanted by a significant proportion of the electorate, who need to be won over, it doesn’t inspire confidence. Meanwhile, Jeremy Corbyn in opposition seems the embodiment of a flawed character. His vanity prevented him from turning down the leadership, a position for which he was clearly unsuited. In less uncertain times, Theresa May’s control freakery and Corbyn’s inflexibility might not matter. But they matter when what’s needed are leaders who can see the wider picture.

{ "title":"Kerry defends US decision not to veto UN resolution against Israeli settlements", "content": "The US secretary of state, John Kerry, has offered a blistering defence of the US decision to allow a UN resolution condemning Israeli settlements, saying if Washington had vetoed it, Israel would have been given a licence for “unfettered settlement construction” and the end of the peace process. Framing a two-state solution as “the only way to achieve a just and lasting peace between Israelis and Palestinians”, Kerry took aim at the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, for building a coalition that was “the most rightwing in Israeli history, with an agenda driven by the most extreme elements”. Kerry’s speech was the latest chapter in a high-octane diplomatic drama marked by a war of words between the Obama administration and Israel, since the vote on Friday that called Israeli settlements in the West Bank and east Jerusalem a “flagrant violation” of international law. The speech was immediately condemned by Netanyahu, who described it as “skewed” and “obsessively” focused on the settlement issue.

It is the permanent policy of [Israeli] settlement construction that risks making peace impossible.” The US secretary of state’s speech came as Donald Trump vowed once again to reverse US policy, which he has described as hostile to Israel, as soon as he takes office on 20 January.

December 28, 2016 Despite being delivered in the last weeks of the Obama administration, Kerry’s speech – as well as the UN resolution – have been widely seen as a part of an effort to future-proof the two-state solution against the incoming Trump administration, giving the EU and other institutions the tools to continue pressuring Israel on issues such as the settlements. This resulted in one of the most passionate speeches delivered by Kerry during his time as America’s leading diplomat. Pushing back at Israel’s fury over the US abstention , Kerry pointedly questioned Netanyahu’s commitment to Palestinian statehood , asking whether Israelis believed their interests were best served by the recent attacks on the Obama administration by Israeli leaders. Kerry also offered a bleak vision of the risk of the collapse of the Oslo peace process and the two-state solution, describing the alternative one-state solution in the darkest terms. “Today, there are a similar number of Jews and Palestinians living between the Jordan river and the Mediterranean Sea,” Kerry told his audience of diplomats in Washington, out lining the demographic reality on the ground that would colour the future of a unitary state. “[Israelis and Palestinians] have a choice. They can choose to live together in one state, or they can separate into two states. “Despite our best efforts over the years, the two-state solution is now in serious jeopardy … We cannot, in good conscience, do nothing, and say nothing, when we see the hope of peace slipping away. “If the choice is one state, Israel can either be Jewish or democratic, it cannot be both, and it won’t ever really be at peace. ” Kerry also took the opportunity to forcefully deny Israeli accusations that the Obama administration had been behind the drafting of the resolution amid Israeli accusations that the US colluded with the Palestinians . The US, insisted Kerry, “did not draft or originate” the UN resolution, adding : “ Nor did we put it forward [in the UN].” “The United States did in fact vote in accordance with our values, just as previous administrations have done,” Kerry said during the speech at the US state department. “The vote in the United Nations was about preserving the two-state solution. That’s what we were standing up for.” Kerry outlined a series of principles he said should form the basis of a future peace accord between Israel and the Palestinians, with the likely participation of the U S, including a “secure and recognised border” between Israel and the new nation of Palestine. He also said an agreement must help Palestinian refugees, designate Jerusalem as a capital for both states and satisfy Israel’s security needs. Kerry insisted that far from abandoning Israel, the Obama administration had been one of its strongest defenders, not least in the signing of a $38bn (£31bn) defence assistance deal.

{ "title":"The Guardian view on Brexit and the arts: a backlash against the modern", "content": "Having a pop at the absurdities of contemporary art has long been a sport beloved of elements of the press, and it has often been enjoyably and wittily played. The Sun, for example, had great fun in 2001, when Martin Creed won the Turner prize, inviting readers to suggest their own ideas to add to Mr Creed’s scrunched-up paper, Blu-Tack, and lights switching on and off. The British love to puncture anything with a whiff of pretension. Not taking oneself too seriously is regarded as a precious national virtue. Yet the tone of rightwing attacks on contemporary art has sharpened this year in the wake of the Brexit vote, as the critic JJ Charlesworth pointed out in ArtReview magazine. Michael Gove tweeted on the night of the Turner prize that the works were mere “modish crap” celebrating “ugliness, nihilism and narcissism – the tragic emptiness of now”. He later complained that the “last thing you should try to do if you want to win the Turner is apply oil to a canvas in a manner which is any way representational of man or nature”. He must have missed recent Turner shortlists that have featured figurative work by painters including Lynette Yiadom-Boakye and George Shaw, as well as Paul Noble, who makes exquisitely detailed drawings. The accusation lurking in the wings is that contemporary art is a complicated con visited on the public by a fanatical set of EU-loving, liberal-elite curators headed by Sir Nicholas Serota, who have set about suppressing floral paintings (former Turner nominee, and sometime flower painter Gillian Carnegie, clearly having slipped through the net). An analogy was more explicitly drawn by a writer in the Express: “Like EU bureaucrats in denial about Brexit, [curators] fail to acknowledge the disconnect between artists and their audience, blaming ignorance or prejudice for a lack of appreciation.” A strange kind of disconnect, this, that sees almost 5 million visitors a year pour into Tate Modern, and a young wave of contemporary art galleries around Britain, like the Hepworth in Wakefield and Turner Contemporary in Margate, connecting their local communities to the work of artists like never before. The Daily Mail wrote disparagingly of “those wandering round the Tate [Turner prize show] treating it all immensely seriously, taking photographs with their mobile telephones and narrowing their eyes in a show of intellectual involvement”. Just possibly, those visitors were not in fact faking their interest, but were actually curious and involved. Even if gullible Tate Britain visitors are not to be trusted, perhaps the market, so admired on the right, ought to be – in which case it should be noted that the Turner prize winner Helen Marten is as successful commercially as she is critically. As for the liberal elite, ask Turner-nominated Michael Dean, who describes his childhood on a Newcastle Upon Tyne estate as “sub-proletarian”. When he made a work partly consisting of £20,435 in pennies (1p below the official poverty line for a family of four) he knows precisely whereof he speaks. Not all art made now is good; certainly, art of the past should not be flung aside in a relentless search for the next thing. Galleries are not foolproof selectors of the work that will survive. There are toilers on the margins whose work will not get the recognition it deserves, maybe ever. But to suggest that the entire contemporary art world is a conspiracy is, like most conspiracy theories, daft.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"UK in 2030: older, more unequal and blighted by Brexit, report predicts", "content": "Britain faces a decade of disruption after Brexit with low growth, stagnating incomes for the poor and the public finances at breaking point, according to a bleak analysis by a leading thinktank. The report, Britain in the 2020s, by the Institute of Public Policy Research, says Brexit will “profoundly reshape the UK … painful trade-offs are almost certain. Growth is expected to be lower, investment rates worse, and the public finances weaker as a result of Brexit.” The analysis, which draws on data from the OECD, the ONS and numerous economists and researchers, forecasts a 30% increase in the number of over-65s in the population by 2030, and a doubling of the number of over-85s. It predicts that the proportion of the population that is non-white will climb to more than one in five within 12 years. The world of work will be revolutionised with millions of jobs in retail and manufacturing disappearing as a result of automation and the internet, the report says. Income inequality will become more entrenched, as will the wealth gap between London and the rest of the country. By 2030 households will on average be £1,700 worse off per year than they would have been if Britain had stayed in the EU, with a persistently falling currency driving up prices and hitting the living standards of poorer people the hardest, according to the report. Low-income households are predicted to see their earnings rise by just 2% between now and 2030, leaving them little better off than a generation before. Meanwhile, the average FTSE 100 chief executive’s pay is forecast to soar to £9.5m by 2030 – 350 times the median income, up from a multiple of 144 today. The report’s author, Mathew Lawrence, said the IPPR had taken a neutral position during the run-up to the EU referendum, and the report simply highlighted how Brexit would exacerbate challenges around inequality and low productivity that the UK was already facing. New barriers to trade after Britain leaves the EU are likely to drive the currency down and to increase costs, the report says. Government finances may buckle under the strain of NHS and pension spending as Britain ages and Brexit reduces the tax base. The 65-plus population will rise to 15.4 million by 2030, from 11.6 million today, while the working-age population will rise by just 3%. Working age population graphic The IPPR predicts a £13bn shortfall in the funding of adult social care alone by 2030 as the government struggles to finance care for elderly people in their homes. Pressure on schools, hospitals and infrastructure will also increase as Britain’s population continues to grow rapidly despite a short-term post-Brexit reduction in EU migration. The report forecasts that the UK will have the fastest growing population of any major country in Europe, overtaking France’s population by 2030 and Germany’s in the late 2040s. The IPPR also predicts a more diverse country, with the non-white proportion rising from 14% in 2011 to 21% by 2030 and to more than a third of the population by 2050. Vast numbers of workers in the UK face losing their jobs as automation progresses, with the economy soon hitting “peak human” before robots and artificial intelligence take over, the IPPR argues. It forecasts that 2m jobs in retail will disappear by 2030 and 600,000 will go in manufacturing. Britain in the 2020s will continue to see a hollowing out of middle-income jobs, with large numbers of well-paid jobs in a few industries – largely in London and the south-east – offset by a growing precariat of poorly paid, often self-employed workers. “There will be more self-employed workers in the 2020s than public sector employees,” the report says. It says the rest of the world also faces a slowdown in economic growth, partly as population growth slows and partly because of climate change. Energy mix graphic It also forecasts crises for China. By 2030 the country will have 17 of the top 50 cities in the world ranked by GDP, but its rapidly ageing population, credit bubbles and political uncertainty will undermine its rise and ensure the US remains the dominant global power. Keir Starmer MP, the shadow Brexit secretary, said: “This report shows once again the clear dangers of a hard Brexit and the importance of ensuring we get the best possible Brexit deal that protects jobs, the economy and living standards. “It also reminds us that there are wider and profound challenges facing the Britain in the years and decades to come - both to our economy, society and our place in the world. Labour has an obligation to future generations to find progressive and effective responses, and to help bring Britain back together after a deeply divisive referendum.” Gerard Lyons, a leading pro-Brexit economist and former adviser to Boris Johnson, dismissed much of the IPPR’s findings as “second-hand questionable figures” and “meaningless jargon”. He said: “Far from being a constraint, Brexit provides the UK with a great opportunity to adopt both a domestic and a global policy agenda to address many of the challenges highlighted by the IPPR in this report.” David Campbell Bannerman, a Tory MEP and member of the Leave Means Leave group which this week asked business groups across Europe to put pressure on their governments to negotiate a free trade agreement with Britain, also criticised the report. “No surprises here from such a favourite Blairite thinktank which receives EU funding. This is misery wrapped in humbug,” he said. “It takes no account of the benefit of UK negotiating free trade deals around the world, of billions saved in deregulation of EU over-regulation, nor of more jobs, better treatment and greater training of the UK workforce once immigration is controlled and the £12bn net savings from EU contributions reinvested.” Looking ahead: what the IPPR foresees 2% – forecast total income growth for poor households between now and 2030. £9.5m – predicted pay of FTSE 100 CEOs by 2030. £341bn – difference between taxes raised and expected spending by 2050. 76 million – population of the UK when it overtakes Germany and becomes Europe’s biggest country in the late 2040s. 21% – non-white proportion of the population by 2030. 15.4 million – number of over-65s in 2030, compared with 11.6 million today. 80% – increase in the number of adults over 65 with dementia by 2030. 10% – decline in China’s working population by 2030, by which time Africa will have more working-age people than China. 1tn – number of sensors connected to the internet by 2025. 2m – number of jobs lost in retail by 2030. 600,000 – number of jobs lost in manufacturing by 2030. 15m – number of current jobs that will be automated in the coming decades. 3m – number of new jobs that will be created by 2030, largely in healthcare and business services.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Snow cabins and jungle showers: the latest perks of a luxury London flat", "content": "It was once thought to be enough to offer basement gyms and bowler-hatted concierges as a lure for the property-buying global elite. But now potential purchasers of £23m flats overlooking the Thames in London are being offered access to their own “snow cabin”, where they can unwind from the rigours of the capital’s social scene among artificial white drifts. This frosty cousin of the sauna is being offered to buyers of apartments at One Blackfriars, a 50-storey tower with views across to St Paul’s Cathedral. It is one of several novel attractions to lure would-be purchasers to the tower, including a “rainforest shower experience” involving a dousing to the sounds of the jungle, a virtual golf course with a whisky bar, a wine tasting room, a hot stone massage parlour and a 20-seat cinema. UK housing market: what to expect in 2017 Read more The perks are being offered as demand for the most expensive new homes in the capital falls dramatically, forcing some developers and estate agents to look for novel ways to encourage sales. Nine newly built homes worth more than £5m were sold in the six months to October, down 83% on the same period in 2015, according to analysis of Land Registry data published earlier this month by property investment company LCP. Increases in stamp duty announced by the former chancellor George Osborne and the uncertainty of Brexit have been blamed. A Chinese developer in Battersea’s Nine Elms area, where there is a glut of newbuild luxury apartments, is promising that staff will turn down buyers’ bedsheets at night, while a rival is offering membership of a private club complete with a rooftop orangery and transparent swimming pool that spans two towers. Marketing staff for the Blackfriars tower believe the snow facility will contribute to a “five-star hotel experience”. A similar attraction, Snow Paradise at the K West hotel in Shepherd’s Bush, west London, consists of a 2m squared cave-like room kept at -15C (5F), with snow pumped into it from a machine that uses air and water. Natalia Rakowska, a marketing manager at K West, said: “It’s like Narnia. You rub your snow into your skin and it feels amazing.” While no affordable housing is being built on the prime site at Blackfriars – the developers have made a £29m contribution to the construction of homes elsewhere in the borough – little expense is being spared on attractions for residents. As well as the snow cabin and rainforest shower, apartment owners will also have access to more standard facilities: a 20-metre swimming pool, a sauna, a steam room, valet parking and a 24-hour concierge provided by Harrods. The first residents are due to move in in 2018. Tom Copley, Labour’s housing spokesman on the London assembly, said: “These kinds of additions are vastly beyond the reach of most of the people we need to house in London. We need to be building homes that people can actually afford to live in. “If you juxtapose the image of the snow room or the jungle shower with the rising number of people sleeping on the streets and in housing need, it paints a very uncomfortable picture of the inequality that exists in London.” Estate agents recognise that the quality and novelty of perks on offer is increasingly important as demand cools. Lauren Kemp, a spokeswoman for LCP, said: “The top end of the market has been battered by taxes. There have been three increases in stamp duty since 2012 and the top rate of stamp duty, for properties above £1.5m, is now 12%. Anybody buying through a company, which was popular for foreign investors, can be hit by a tax of up to £250,000 a year.” In its marketing literature, Berkeley Homes says: “Maintaining the comfort of the residents at One Blackfriars is essential.” One Blackfriars was criticised last year when it was advertised with a video that showed a young couple arriving in the capital in a private helicopter. A narrator described their visits to “exclusive boutiques” and London’s museums. The video faced criticism accusing it of being elitist. It came amid growing concern that London’s housing market is being distorted by an increasing number of foreign investors, some of whom rarely occupy their homes. Earlier this month, the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, appointed the London School of Economics to carry out an inquiry into the impact of foreign investment on London’s housing market. Earlier this year, the Guardian revealed that a 50-storey block of 214 luxury apartments by the river Thames in Vauxhall was more than 60% owned by foreign buyers. One-quarter of the flats were held by companies in secretive offshore tax havens and many were unoccupied.",diasaster:0},

A Belgian-registered boat got into trouble off the Kent coast on Tuesday night, and two of the crew were rescued by a coastguard helicopter based at Lydd. One of those rescued was taken from the water but later died in hospital; the other had been winched to safety from the stricken boat. The search for the third crew member was called off at about 4.30pm beause of the failing light. The lifeboats have returned to their stations, and it remains unclear whether the search will continue on Thursday. The incident came to light earlier in the day, when the first person rescued was found clinging to the hull of the overturned boat by a passing vessel at about 7.45am – nine hours after the boat capsized off the Kent coast at about 11pm. The man was airlifted and taken to the William Harvey hospital at Ashford. Coastguards carried out a search for the crew members, and a spokeswoman for the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) said the search area extended from Ramsgate to the mid-Channel area. Map On Wednesday afternoon, the exposed hull of the vessel could be seen in the water with most of it submerged. Rescuers found the overturned wreckage empty, leading to fears that the men had been swept away by the tide on a night where sea temperatures dropped to as low as 5C. The coastguard search and rescue helicopter based at Lydd, lifeboats from Ramsgate and Harwich and the coastguard rescue team from Margate were scrambled to join the search for the Belgian-registered boat.

{ "title":"Bradley Wiggins announces retirement from professional cycling", "content": "Sir Bradley Wiggins has announced his retirement from cycling, calling time on a 16-year career as a professional in which he won the Tour de France and a record eight Olympic medals. In a statement posted on his Instagram account the 2012 Tour winner said he had “been lucky enough to live a dream and fulfil my childhood aspiration of making a living and career out of the sport I fell in love with at the age of 12”. He added: “What will stick with me forever is the support and love from the public through thick and thin, all as a result of riding a pushbike for a living.” Wiggins posted his message alongside a photograph of many of the prizes bestowed on him; a career snapshot including five gold, one silver and two bronze Olympic medals as well as many of the jerseys he was zipped into on assorted podiums after successful tilts at stage races such as the Tour de France. As accomplished against the clock as he was in the peloton, the 36-year-old from Kilburn’s palmarès also boasts the prestigious hour record of 54.526km he set in what was perhaps the ultimate “race of truth” at London’s Lee Valley VeloPark in 2015. Bradley Wiggins' life and career – in pictures Read more Born in the Belgian city of Ghent in 1980, Wiggins and his mother, Linda, moved to her parents’ house in Kilburn after his father, Gary, an Australian professional track cyclist, left them when Wiggins was two years old. “He abandoned us,” Wiggins said on an appearance on Desert Island Discs last year. “It’s never left me and it will continue to stay with me for the rest of my life.” Wiggins’s father had problems with alcohol and drugs and was found beaten and left for dead on a roadside in New South Wales in 2008. He later passed away in hospital. For all his understandable abandonment issues, Wiggins had some fond memories of his dad and deliberately chose to end his competitive career with victory – alongside his old friend Mark Cavendish – at the famous Six Day race staged annually on the timbers of Ghent’s famous ’t Kuipke velodrome last November. “I always think of my dad when I’m in here,” he said. “He was a terrible father but I still idolise him as a bike rider because I wouldn’t be here without him.” For all his Olympic medals, those world and Olympic time-trial titles, the eight world track titles and that famous win in France, it was perhaps a photo of Wiggins lounging on a golden throne in front of Hampton Court Palace, flicking victory Vs at photographers in the wake of his time-trial win at the London 2012 Olympics, that officially elevated him to the status of national treasure during a summer in which he also won the Tour de France with Team Sky. It was classic Wiggins: effortless cool mixed with contrarianism, the Kilburn mod playing up to the cameras as he sprawled in regal recline in surroundings that, despite being located less than 20 miles from where he grew up, could scarcely be further removed from Dibdin House in Kilburn. As popular for his outspoken comments, dry sense of humour and fondness for the musical stylings of Paul Weller as he was for his talent as a cyclist, Wiggins went on to win that year’s BBC Sports Personality of the Year Award before making something of a mockery of his man of the people credentials as he accepted a knighthood from the Queen at Buckingham Palace a year later. “It was quite nerve-racking actually,” he said after his investiture. “I’m still shaking now, to be honest. I mean, it’s quite humbling being here.” For all his success and popularity Wiggins’s career path has not been without its bumps and potholes. A likable and funny but occasionally spiky character who has long been outspoken against the use of banned drugs in cycling, he was forced to confront the issue head on when the Fancy Bears hackers leaked his personal medical history, raising legitimate questions about his use of therapeutic use exemptions, which allow athletes with certain medical conditions to use substances that are banned by Wada. Wiggins was revealed to have had three intramuscular injections of a powerful corticosteroid that Team Sky claim was to treat a hay fever allergy shortly before each of his last three Grand Tours in 2011 and 2012. Bradley Wiggins completes victorious circle by winning at birthplace Ghent Read more Wiggins had made no mention of receiving any such treatment in his 2012 autobiography, My Time, written in collaboration with the Guardian’s cycling correspondent William Fotheringham, and the Fancy Bears leaks have left Wiggins and the previously holier-than-thou Team Sky open to accusations they crossed an ethical line in a sport that has long been dogged by high-profile controversies, involving illegal drug use. “I was paranoid about making excuses,” Wiggins explained in an interview with the Guardian when asked why he had not mentioned the allergy in the book. “It wasn’t something I was going to shout from the rooftops.” Perhaps wisely he chose not to shout his retirement from the rooftops either, opting instead for a low-key statement on social media. While it made no mention of the controversy that will forever remain as a black mark on an otherwise pristine CV, it did once again parrot his heartwarmingly irrefutable assertion that he remains living proof that “kids from Kilburn” can win “Olympic golds and Tour de Frances”.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Liberal values and the growth of inequality", "content": "Jonathan Freedland cites compassion for victims of war, the peaceful resolution of international disputes, Enlightenment values and a free press as the hallmarks of liberalism (Don’t fall for these dishonest attacks on the ‘liberal elite’, 24 December). But what of free trade and free markets? Low tax, the small state and deregulation? These too are hallmarks of liberalism in its “neo” form. Liberalism stands for the freedom of the individual and the sanctity of individual liberties – as well as the openness and plurality that Freedland prefers to celebrate. The right of the individual to freedom from regulation or restraint is the notion that has driven globalisation, market fundamentalism and our present, unfettered, toxic form of capitalism. And those are the forces that have stripped many of the Trump voters in the rust belt and Brexit supporters in the north of England of their security, their dignity and their hope for their kids. Clinton (both), Blair, Cameron, Obama, all social liberals, all drank the neoliberal Kool Aid. The failure of progressives to sever social liberalism from its economic counterpart has led us to this crisis (Clegg, take note). Brexit and Trump are in many ways the fruits of liberalism. Equality of opportunity is the liberal touchstone. Well and good. But the chance for the bright, energetic – or lucky – few to get ahead has done nothing to stop the corrosive growth of inequality. What we need now is a commitment to a much greater – and universal – equality of outcomes. Is that a liberal value? Rod Wood Nottingham Don’t fall for these dishonest attacks on the ‘metropolitan liberal elite’ | Jonathan Freedland Read more • Jonathan Freedland casts much-needed light in the gloom of Brexit, Farage and Trump; most of all on Theresa May’s ridiculous reduction of “remainers” to a small metropolitan elite of “citizens of the world and of nowhere”. And yet, there is a danger of a different kind of reductionism. Having trudged the streets of one post-industrial city, Stoke, over recent years, and gathered stories from many people about decline, racism and radicalisation, we have, still, much work to do in understanding why Farage, and Brexit, have played so well. If this is largely to do with the economy, it is because people often feel dismissively stereotyped by metropolitans as passé, “northern”, “failures” and “basket cases”. Note might also be made of how elements of the cultural elite are responsible for a huge and mainly negative representational shift of working-class life over many decades: from Alan Sillitoe’s cussed, rugged but respected characters in Saturday Night and Sunday Morning to the pornography of Benefit Cheats. Alongside all of this, we should also remember the political abandonment of whole estates by an elite called New Labour. Stockbroker Farage appals me too, but his appeal, like that of the BNP or EDL, is partly explained by processes of abandonment and stereotyping by elites in the City, in politics and in parts of the media. And I guess some of those might think of themselves as “liberal”. Professor Linden West Faculty of Education, Canterbury Christ Church University The left needs to use sensible language again • Jonathan Freedland is right to recognise that all sorts believe in that better, more egalitarian and compassionate society where rights and responsibilities set out in a balanced way resonate. The trouble is that many of our ilk (yes, Guardian readers and in particular liberal-minded lefties) wouldn’t last five minutes when talking to so many who voted leave. The left needs to use sensible language again, as Steve Richards implies (Take back control – the slogan the left should make its own, 20 December). We need literate, lateral thinkers who encompass the equivalent of the politics of Crosland to Crossman, who ensured my party was (almost) the natural party of government under Harold Wilson. Labour can do that again if it creates a proper coalition putting emphasis on more but not absolute economic equality, asking the better off (not just millionaires) to pay their dues in return for a Beveridge-style settlement that reduces means tests and workfare and pensioners having to sell homes to pay for care, raising living standards with more full-time employment rather than this zero-hours, triple-job, low-wage economy.

{ "title":"Toshiba shares fall 20% as nuclear writedown sinks in", "content": "Toshiba shares dived more than 20% on Wednesday in their second straight double-digit plunge as the company said it may book a one-time loss of several billion dollars over its US nuclear business. Toshiba’s stock price dropped by 20.42% to 311.60 yen, the largest fall allowed for a single day, about 30 minutes after the opening bell, as the company failed to remove investor worries over the potential risk. On Tuesday the Tokyo-based conglomerate said costs linked to the acquisition in 2015 by its US subsidiary of a nuclear service company would possibly come to “several billion US dollars, resulting in a negative impact on Toshiba’s financial results”. The exact figure of the potential writedown was still being worked out, Toshiba president Satoshi Tsunakawa said after the announcement, apologising for “causing concern”. The company statement suggested the figure would be released soon, citing an end-of-year deadline. Toshiba shares had closed nearly 12% lower on Tuesday on media reports about the potential loss. Analysts said uncertainty was fuelling investor anxiety. “Concerns have yet to be cleared away as they said they didn’t know the figure,” Yukihiko Shimada, senior analyst at SMBC Nikko Securities, told AFP. SMBC Nikko credit analysts Yutaka Ban and Kentaro Harada said in a report that investors “can’t be optimistic about the situation” even though the total writedown may not end up as big as the 500 billion yen (US$4.3bn) reported by local media. Nomura Securities analyst Masaya Yamasaki said in a report issued late on Tuesday that the expected loss “is negative for the company as its financial standing is fragile”. Tsunakawa answered in the affirmative when asked if Toshiba was considering boosting capital. Its chief financial officer, Masayoshi Hirata, said that after the figure was confirmed the company would “explain and seek support” from financial institutions. Toshiba said the possible loss was related to the valuation of the purchase by subsidiary Westinghouse Electric of the nuclear construction and services business of Chicago Bridge and Iron. Westinghouse and Chicago Bridge and Iron turned to an independent accountant to resolve a dispute over differences in asset valuations, Toshiba said earlier in 2016. Toshiba said Tuesday that the potential writedown would “far exceed” the $87m first expected, resulting in a “far lower asset value than originally determined”. Toshiba’s latest full-year forecast is for annual net profit of 145bn yen (US$1.24bn), up 45% from an earlier estimate, on sales of 5.4tn yen. But on Tuesday it said it would release a revised earnings forecast as soon as possible to reflect the coming writedown. Toshiba’s nuclear business woes are the latest blow to the once-proud pillar of corporate Japan. It has been besieged by problems, most notably a profit-padding scandal in which bosses for years systematically pushed subordinates to cover up weak financial results. In an intensive overhaul the company has been shedding businesses and announced the sale of its medical devices unit to camera and office equipment maker Canon. Investors had welcomed the makeover, with Toshiba shares having climbed 77.3% this year through Monday. Tsunakawa was appointed president during 2016 to steer Toshiba past the accounting scandal that has hammered its reputation.",diasaster:0},

May is no Henry VIII – but Brexit has dragged us back to a very Tudor chaos | Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett Read more In an interview with the Guardian, the Labour leader insisted that the prime minister could not be allowed to use the royal prerogative to bypass the Commons over the UK’s future relationship with continental Europe. Earlier this month, May repeatedly refused to commit to a parliamentary vote during a select committee hearing – prompting Corbyn to conjure up an image of the prime minister acting as if she was an overbearing Tudor. “It [a final Brexit deal] would have to come to parliament. She cannot hide behind Henry VIII and the divine rights of the power of kings on this one,” he said, pointing out that MEPs in the European parliament would have a vote on the proposed settlement. “The idea that on something as major as this the prime minister would use the royal prerogative to bypass parliament is extraordinary – I don’t know where she’s coming from.” Facebook Twitter Pinterest Theresa May. Photograph: David Hartley/Rex/Shutterstock The comments, which refer to whatever deal is agreed at the end of the Brexit negotiating process in 2019 rather than the trigger of article 50 next year, came during a wide-ranging interview. Corbyn also: Launched a vehement defence of the benefits of European migration into Britain, saying workers contributed “massively” to the NHS, education, manufacturing, agriculture and care work. Said the answer to fears over immigration was to crack down on exploitative work practices, and that he was sceptical about government plans for a work visa system. Was bullish about the prospect of another leadership challenge from Labour MPs concerned about the party’s poor performance in the polls, saying: “I am always ready for a summer of campaigning.” And suggested that Labour’s previous leader, Tony Blair, would not be making any comeback to the parliamentary party under his watch. The Labour leader said Blair had already ruled himself out of the forthcoming byelection in Copeland, in Cumbria, triggered by the resignation of Jamie Reed. Theresa May 'lacks courage to admit complexity of Brexit' Read more But asked if he would be happy with another constituency amid rumours that Blair was considering a comeback, Corbyn said: “I think the nuanced differences of opinion between me and Tony Blair are quite well known … I don’t see Tony Blair and I working together. I don’t think he does either.” His frank language about both the prime minister and Blair come as Labour strategists seek to ramp up Corbyn’s image as a leftwing populist who is prepared to rail against establishment figures. They believe that while the Labour leader is already seen in that way by part of the population, there are too many voters who may consider the Islington MP to be part of the establishment. Corbyn is expected to appear more frequently on television, as an expanded team of advisers work up policies aimed at underlining a willingness to lead a revolt against vested interests. Despite pressure from Labour MPs, including Manchester mayoral hopeful Andy Burnham, to take a tougher line on free movement, Corbyn did not list immigration among his post-Brexit priorities. Instead, he spelled out a desire to protect “market access” as well as maintaining human rights and opposing racism. Arguing that Britain could not be a “bargain basement economy” on the edge of Europe, he also claimed that there was a “level of exaggeration” about any negative impacts of migration on British society. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Andy Burnham, who has urged Labour to take a tougher stance on immigration. Photograph: Peter Byrne/PA Corbyn said: “We should recognise that European workers in Britain do contribute massively to the health service, education, manufacturing industry, care work, agricultural sector. We’d be in quite a difficult place if they all went. “We have to recognise that people do move around the continent, do move to work, do move to pay taxes and to benefit the economy that they come into. They don’t have unfettered access to benefits the day they arrive in Britain, they don’t have unfettered access to housing the day they arrive.” Corbyn said he wanted people to “think for a moment: who treats them when they go to the doctors, who treats them when they go to hospital, who is doing the technical work often in many places, and you’ll find the same with British people all over the world.” Corbyn argued that companies such as Airbus, Nissan and Hitachi needed to be free to move skilled workers around Europe and would leave Britain if Brexit meant higher tariffs to access the single market. He also hinted that he believed continued free movement would be necessary to secure Labour’s priority of economic access, claiming that a work visa scheme would be “fraught with difficulties” because of the high level of integration with Europe. He also cast doubts on whether Labour would support a system in which people could only come if they had a job. “Well then, that will work in reverse for British people going abroad, which would be difficult to implement and maybe is counter to the principles of the European market.” However, he did set out plans for a policy – which he is expected to stress much more frequently in 2017 – which could result in migration numbers falling. “What we need to address is exploitation, undercutting and the way in which companies are trying to destroy industrial agreements by ignoring what they should be doing, which is paying people properly and not bringing people in to undercut,” said Corbyn. The Labour leader said he was building alliances with socialist parties in other countries because the final Brexit deal hammered out over two years after article 50 is triggered will be put to the European parliament. Corbyn hits back after Obama suggests Labour is disintegrating Read more “Presumably all national parliaments will want a say as well, so our relations with socialist groups in every national parliament could be important,” said Corbyn, before insisting that British MPs also had to be given a vote on the deal. It is not clear whether the government is prepared to offer that or not. The Brexit secretary, David Davis, has hinted that MPs could be given a vote, but May was unwilling to offer that commitment when she appeared in front of the liaison committee last week. Corbyn also urged all members of the leftwing campaigning group Momentum to join the Labour party. He also encouraged the hundreds of thousands of people who joined Labour to back him to get more involved in campaigning, amid claims from MPs that new members were failing to turn out. He said he wanted all MPs to move on from the summer’s leadership contest and insisted that the party was in a strong position despite some dire recent poll ratings. Corbyn said he hoped to gain seats in May’s local elections and claimed the media was ignoring Labour’s successes. “I can’t pretend the two byelection results were good,” he said about results in Richmond Park in London and Sleaford, Lincolnshire. “But on the same day we gained a ward in Telford … with a 20% increase in vote, and overall majority on council. We’ve never won that ward ever – no media reported that. We held a ward in Lancaster.” He added: “Results vary; I want to do better.” Corbyn dismissed reports that he has told friends he is ready to step down in 2019 because of his age, saying: “Friends is obviously a very loose term these days – I’ve never said that. I’m very happy doing my campaigning. This is the age of the 60s – look at Trump, Clinton, Sanders, Angela Merkel – look around you. Sixties is the new 40s, I keep fit.”",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"'A more dangerous long-term threat': Al-Qaida grows as Isis retreats", "content": "When three al-Qaida veterans were killed in Syria, Yemen and Afghanistan in October, it barely created a ripple. So dominant has Isis become in the realm of jihadist lore, that you could be forgiven for thinking that its precursor has been relegated to a mere footnote. You’d be wrong. Those three deaths, all in US airstrikes, paradoxically hint at a resurgence of al-Qaida, at a time when Isis is in retreat in Iraq, Syria and Libya. Quietly, and more through soft power rather than harsh atrocity, al-Qaida is trying to mount a revival. The Pentagon said that at least one of the three leaders killed, Haydar Kirkan, a 20-year veteran of the group, had been actively planning attacks against the west at the time of his death. This is a controversial claim as al-Qaida, founded in 1988, has in recent years foresworn such long-range operations in favour of a strategy privileging a slow and steady building of influence and capability at a local level within the Islamic world. In part, this decision – taken by Ayman al-Zawahiri, the leader of al-Qaida, shortly after he succeeded the late Osama bin Laden in 2011 – was forced on the group by its weakness after years of being targeted by the US and allies in the wake of the attacks of 11 September 2001. Losing ground, fighters and morale – is it all over for Isis? Read more But more recently it has been a deliberate attempt to distance it from Isis, which has been responsible for directly organised strikes in France, Belgium, Germany and Tunisia, among others, and – through so-called “lone wolves” – in the US. Al-Qaida and its affiliates have deliberately shunned the savagery of Isis, seeking to build support across the Islamic world through outreach to tribal leaders, power brokers and sometimes the broader community, rather than outright fear and coercion. The group does not seek publicity. “Al-Qaida’s strategic experience is that if it makes a big deal of seizing territory, it attracts CT [counter-terrorism] resources, so it is simply not being as loud about it,” said Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, an expert at the Foundation for Defense of Democracy, a US thinktank. The three locations of the US strikes two months ago are significant. Afghanistan, Yemen and Syria are all key strategic zones where Isis has either failed to make significant advances or, in the latter case, is on the retreat. South Asia heading map In January 2015, Isis formally announced the establishment of what it called Khorasan province in Afghanistan and western Pakistan. The move, coupled with an attempt to expand in Bangladesh, signified a push to branch out into south Asia and win recruits among the more than 400 million Muslims in the region. But the militants have had little success. “Despite its best efforts … the Islamic State controls little territory in south Asia, [has] conducted only a handful of attacks, failed to secure the support of most locals, and struggled with poor leadership,” wrote Seth Jones, a former adviser to US forces in Afghanistan, this month. A major obstacle to the expansion of Isis in the region has been the opposition of most local militant groups, notably the Taliban. Al-Qaida, which has preserved a close relationship with the Taliban and some other militant groups, is still present in Afghanistan. In October 2015, US and Afghan forces attacked a huge training compound in the south of the country, killing more than 200 militants. The camp was used by al-Qaida in the Indian Subcontinent (AQIS), an affiliate established in 2014. South Asian officials point out that AQIS has so far failed to carry out any significant attacks or attract large numbers of recruits. However, that al-Qaida had survived at all in the region was “impressive”, one said. “There’s been constant pressure on the group, and particularly its leadership element, for 15 years, and they’re still there. The death of al-Qahtani is a blow, but they’ve suffered worse and still come back,” said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity. Yemen heading map Another key battlefield has been Yemen, where, in perhaps the most striking unintended consequence of the Saudi-led military intervention in the country, al-Qaida was able to run a mini-state on Yemen’s coast for many months. The substantial and strategically situated port city of Mukalla provided the group with a revenue of an estimated $2m a day. A 2015 US government report estimated that al-Qaida in the Arabian peninsula (AQAP), the Yemen-based affiliate, could muster at least 4,000 fighters, four times the total a year previously. The group has also built ties with southern Yemenis, who have felt marginalised by the country’s northern elite for years. “We may be facing a more complicated al-Qaida, not just a terrorist organisation, but a movement controlling territory with happy people inside it,” said a regional diplomat who follows Yemen. Africa map Al-Qaida has also successfully expanded its presence in Africa. The violence and brutality associated with the Nigerian-based Boko Haram group, which has now split over its nominal allegiance to Isis, and the Isis expansion into Egypt, Tunisia and Libya, have overshadowed the less spectacular but arguably more effective efforts made by al-Qaida affiliates on the continent. In Somalia, commanders of the al-Shabaab movement ruthlessly eliminated pro-Isis factions that wanted to repudiate the group’s five-year-old allegiance to al-Qaida. A last dissident group is currently under siege from Somali forces in the far north of Somalia, in semi-autonomous Puntland, and facing annihilation. In the Sahel, although one new faction has emerged to launch attacks in the name of Isis, it is the coalition of factions that form al-Qaida in the Maghreb (AQIM) that is dominant. AQIM has exploited deep ties – some through marriage – with local communities and levered ethnic disputes to gain support and capabilities in Mali, a key state that French and other international forces have been unable to rid of extremists. “Al-Qaida is on a trajectory to become by far the most powerful jihadist movement in Africa,” said Gartenstein-Ross. Levant heading map The most significant theatre may well turn out to be the Levant. Though most analysts believe Isis will remain a powerful – even if fragmented – force in the region for years to come, al-Qaida may be the biggest winner. The key to its strategy has been the Syria-based group now called Jabhat Fateh al-Sham (JFS). Formerly known as al-Nusra Front, the powerful faction was rebranded in late July as a force without links to the global jihadi struggle but dedicated only to fighting Bashar al-Assad’s regime and its allies. In recent years, al-Qaida has repeatedly attempted to downplay its links to local groups to avoid alienating communities which do not want to be part of a “global jihad” but which hope Islamic hardliners might impose order and honest, if rigorous, administration in areas they control. Western officials fear JFS will not only dominate the jihadi landscape in the Levant following the defeat of Isis, but may also provide a springboard for al-Qaida to launch strikes into Europe, should the group change its current strategy. Zawahiri has made it clear that although the group may have prioritised local campaigns for the moment, it still remains committed to attacks on the west in the long term. “As the Islamic State continues to lose territory and as the international coalition continues targeted airstrikes, we are likely to see another name in the headlines more often: Jabhat Fateh al-Sham,” said Matthew Henman, of Jane’s Terrorism and Insurgency Centre. Hoffman described JFS as “even more capable than the Islamic State and a more dangerous long-term threat”.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"The lesson of Trump and Brexit: a society too complex for its people risks everything", "content": "By way of a gloomy seasonal party game, try this. Take the proverbial back of a cereal box, divide it into six rectangles, and on each one, write a supposed cause of the political turbulence now gripping the west: “the financial crash of 2008”, “inequality”, “racism and xenophobia”, “Tony Blair, basically”, and all the rest. Then get out the gin, maybe put on a Radiohead album, and enjoy hours of doom-laden conversational fun. Were I daft enough to play the game myself, on one rectangle, I think I’d write an explanation so far barely mentioned in the acres of coverage of 2016’s chaos, but one right at the heart of it all: “Ever-increasing complexity, and the diminishing returns it now creates.” It’s not the snappiest conversation starter, I know. But if you’re looking for a grand catch-all theory that ties together Donald Trump, Brexit, and the general sense of a world spinning into chaos, it might not be a bad place to begin. Complexity, after all, is a 21st-century leitmotif, captured in those news-channel screens on which scrolling tickers and stockmarket data combine to create the impression of a world so elaborate it is beyond anyone’s control. The average browse on Twitter creates exactly the same impression; so does a scroll through a Facebook news feed, now rendered even more confusing by the fact that a great deal of its content may well not be authentic “news” at all. Individual lives are more scrambled and complicated than they have ever been. For a lot of us, modernity is a mess Perhaps more crucially, individual lives are surely more scrambled and complicated than they have ever been. For a lot of us, in fact, modernity is a mess: not just of multiple user accounts, passwords, contracts for smartphones and Wi-Fi, and the generalised insanity of consumerism, but working lives that now have to undergo endless peaks, troughs and reinventions. The latter applies even to those who think of themselves as relatively successful, let alone people at the blunt end. From the US tax code to the structures of the European Union (an organisation so complex that leaving it is starting to look all but impossible), all this complication is also reflected in the workings of states and governments. Moreover, though they were sold to us as a means of simplifying the tangled messes weaved by bureaucracies, the endless marketisation and contracting-out that now define policies across the planet have only made things worse. Consider what the American thinker David Graeber calls his “iron law of liberalism”: “Any market reform, any government initiative intended to reduce red tape and promote market forces will have the ultimate effect of increasing the total number of … regulations, the total amount of paperwork, and the total number of bureaucrats the government employs.” There perhaps was a time when the idea that increasing complexity would benefit most people just about held true: the 1990s maybe spring to mind. But now? As we all know, wages are continuing to stagnate. Across the UK, Europe and the US, there are increasing worries about sluggish-to-flatlining productivity and disappointing economic growth. Automation is already disrupting millions of working lives. Therein, of course, lies huge opportunities for the insurgents now defining the political zeitgeist. Their basic approach is: a withering look at the labyrinthine realties of trade, technology, population movement, international agreements and the rest, followed by the simplest of answers: “Take back control”, “Make America great again”. Facebook Twitter Pinterest ‘Declining returns make complexity a less attractive problem-solving strategy.’ Photograph: Andrew Kelly/Reuters All this began to sit in my thoughts as I was putting together a radio documentary about the new populism, and reading a book by the US anthropologist and historian Joseph Tainter, which brims with implied parallels between far-flung periods of history and more recent events. It may be some token of our turbulent times that it’s titled The Collapse of Complex Societies: I was alerted to it after reading a brilliant post-Brexit piece authored by French writer Paul Arbair, and I have been dipping into it ever since. The book was published in 1988, just before the fall of communism was about to offer another case study in what it describes. One key pattern, it argues, applies to whole chunks of history: the way that increasingly complicated systems initially deliver big economic benefits, only for diminishing returns to set in, as systems of power and control become overstretched. Ever-increasing burdens are not matched by material rewards, and popular resentment kicks in. Don’t fall for these dishonest attacks on the ‘metropolitan liberal elite’ | Jonathan Freedland Read more Tainter’s text covers the demise of ancient Rome and collapse of Mayan civilization in the 9th century, the Minoans and Hittites, and the Chinese Zhou dynasty. He talks about common features of these societies’ fall: “revolts and provincial breakaways”, the end of long-distance trade, resource depletion, declining economic growth, and a point many societies have eventually crashed into: when they are “able to do little more than maintain the status quo”. Currencies become debased; “bridges and roads are not kept up”. Precipitous changes in climate often underlie what happens. At certain points in history, Tainter says, “declining returns make complexity a less attractive problem-solving strategy”. Under such conditions, the option to “sever the ties that link localised groups to a regional entity” could gain traction. If you understand “regional” in a global rather than national sense, that’s surely a pretty good summary of Brexit, and the resentments now festering all across Europe. I got in touch with Tainter, and though he cautioned me against generalised comparisons, he agreed that complexity held the key to a lot of current developments. “The simpler past seems more attractive than today’s complex reality, and so people vote [thanks to] inchoate frustrations,” he told me. “They choose simplicity and locality over complexity; identity over internationalism. Politicians promote themselves by giving voice to this. Hence, in addition to Brexit, we have calls for Scottish independence, Catalan independence, and so forth.” If complexity and globalisation gave recognisable benefits, he said, the phenomenon would not be so widespread. Quite so, but this is the exact way in which modernity is failing. Visions of imminent social collapse might be taking all this a bit too far. Or maybe not, for as Tainter writes: “Civilisations are fragile, impermanent things.” Are modern societies vulnerable? It’s a common belief, he says, that our technological capacity, energy resources and our knowledge of economics and history mean our civilisation should be able to survive “whatever crises ancient and simpler societies found insurmountable”. But as a corrective, he then quotes the revered German classicist Ulrich von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff’s sobering take on the lessons of the Roman empire.

The 40-year-old, who was not identified, was held during a search of his home and business, federal prosecutors said. Calls for Polish truck driver killed in Berlin to receive order of merit Read more The man’s telephone number was saved in the mobile phone of Anis Amri, a fellow Tunisian believed to have driven a truck into the market on 19 December. Amri, 24, was killed in a shootout with police in a suburb of Milan early on Friday. Of the new suspect, prosecutors said “further investigations indicate that he may have been involved in the attack”. Twelve people died in the truck attack. Islamic State has claimed responsibility, and released a video on Friday in which Amri is shown pledging allegiance to the Isis chief, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. Prosecutors have until Thursday evening to determine whether the case against the 40-year-old is strong enough for them to seek a formal arrest warrant. That would allow them to keep him in custody pending possible charges. Investigators are trying to determine whether Amri had a support network in planning and carrying out the attack, and in fleeing Berlin. Tunisian authorities announced on Saturday that they had arrested Amri’s nephew and two other men suspected of being members of a “terrorist cell” connected to Amri, though they made no direct link to the Berlin attack. Investigators are also trying to piece together the route he took to Milan. Two days after the attack, Amri boarded an overnight bus in the Dutch city of Nijmegen, near the German border, that took him to Lyon in central France, a source close to the investigation said, confirming a French media report. Wim de Bruin, a spokesman for the Dutch public prosecution service, said: “We believe he was in Nijmegen, most likely last Wednesday.” “There are video images and it’s very likely him,” De Bruin said, adding that “it’s most likely here where he received a sim card,” which Italian police later found on his body. Amri got off the bus at the Lyon-Part-Dieu rail station, another source said. Surveillance cameras filmed Amri at the station last Thursday. From there, he took a train to the French Alpine town of Chambéry before heading to Milan, in northern Italy. He then made his way to the suburb of Sesto San Giovanni, where he was shot dead by police after opening fire on them during a routine identity check. A train ticket from Lyon to Milan via Turin was found on his body. Investigators are still trying to determine how Amri was able to leave Berlin and traverse most of Germany to reach the Netherlands.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"US recounts find no evidence of hacking in Trump win but reveal vulnerabilities", "content": "There is no evidence of a successful cyberattack to change votes in the US presidential election, according to a crowdfunded effort to recount the vote in key states, but the review also highlighted the unprecedented extent to which the American political system is vulnerable to cyberattack, according to two computer scientists who helped the effort to audit the vote. J Alex Halderman and Matt Bernhard, both of the University of Michigan, campaigned in favor of a recount of the US presidential election, which was eventually spearheaded by Jill Stein, the Green party candidate. What we know about Russia's interference in the US election Read more Only the Wisconsin recount was substantially completed, with the recount in Michigan eventually stopped and a potential recount in Pennsylvania killed before it had even begun. But the researchers say the recounted counties and precincts were enough to give them confidence that Donald Trump is the genuine winner of the election. “The recounts support that the election outcome was correct,” Bernhard told the Chaos Communications Congress cybersecurity convention in Hamburg, where he and Halderman gave a talk summarising their findings. In Wisconsin, the only state where the recount was finished, Trump’s victory increased by 131 votes, while in Michigan, where 22 of 83 counties had a full or partial recount, incomplete data suggests was a net change of 1,651 votes, “but no evidence of an attack”, Bernhard said. “I can sleep at night knowing that Trump won the election.” After the talk, Bernhard clarified that no evidence of hacking is not the same as evidence of no hacking. “We didn’t conclude that hacking didn’t happen,” he told the Guardian, but “based on the little evidence we have, it is less likely that hacking influenced the outcome of the election. “Just because evidence [of hacking] wasn’t found, that doesn’t mean the results were completely valid.” But the experience of pushing for the recount hasn’t reassured Halderman and Bernhard that American democracy is safe. In fact, quite the opposite, said Halderman. “Along the way, we found that hacking an election in the US for president would be even easier than I thought.” His previous research had already demonstrated security vulnerabilities in every model of voting machine examined, for instance, which would enable an attacker to silently rewrite the electronic record of how many votes each candidate received. But only this election did he learn the extent of centralisation in the organisations that are in charge of maintaining and preparing the voting machines. In Michigan, for example, 75% of counties use just two companies, each around 20 employees large, to load their machines. Compromising those two companies would theoretically be enough to swing the vote in the state. “How central these points of attack are, that was news to me,” Halderman said. Similarly, Halderman’s previous research had demonstrated the importance of an auditable paper-trail for electronic voting: either the physical ballot for a machine that scans ballot papers, or a countable receipt for a fully digital system. Theoretically, the existence of that paper trail should provide a protection against attempts to centrally hack the vote. How 2016 became the year of the hack – and what it means for the future Read more In practice, however, the last two months have shown that that’s cold comfort. “Also shocking is how unlikely states are to look at any of the paper, even in a surprising and close election like this,” Halderman said. “Even if a candidate can force a recount – and this is probably the most damning thing about the entire experience – there are many many opportunities for the apparent winner to try to stop them, and they will probably be successful.” The pair called for three significant changes to the electoral process as a result of their experience with the 2016 recount, which should help protect the state. “What we need in the US, quite badly, is some specific reform to the election process,” Halderman said. “Even if the 2016 election wasn’t hacked, the 2020 election might well be; we’re facing increasingly powerful and successful state attackers. We need some defence.” Firstly, Halderman called for a “common sense” hardening of voting technology, ensuring that the technological flaws which he and his colleagues have been demonstrating for over a decade are finally dealt with. Secondly, he called for a mandatory requirement for voting machines to provide a physical ballot in addition to a digital record: in Pennsylvania, for instance, 70% of digital votes leave no paper record at all. The final defence requested was for states to actually use the evidence they have, by instituting mandatory “risk-limiting audits”. By counting a small but statistically significant and randomly selected sample of paper ballots, the state can prove statistically that the vote has not been tampered with, without needing to go to the expense of initiating a full recount, and without losing the organisational benefits of digital voting machines. “I’m pretty sure my undergraduate security class could have changed the outcome of the presidential election,” Halderman said. “It really is that bad.” This article was amended on 29 December 2016 to clarify comments made by Matt Bernhard.",diasaster:0},

{ "title":"The two-state solution in the Middle East – all you need to know", "content": "The US secretary of state, John Kerry, has set out the parameters for a potential resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in a last throw of the dice on this issue for the Obama administration. His speech focused on the “two-state solution”. What’s the basic idea? For decades, the two-state solution has been held up by the international community as the only realistic deal to end the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Its basis is two separate states, Israel and Palestine, living peacefully side by side on the land between the western bank of the Jordan river and the Mediterranean Sea. This territory would be divided broadly along the pre-1967 armistice line or “green line” – probably with some negotiated land swaps. Jerusalem, which both sides want as their capital, would be shared. What are the obstacles? Past negotiations have failed to make progress and there are currently no fresh talks in prospect. The main barriers are borders, Jerusalem, refugees, Israel’s insistence on being recognised as a “Jewish state” and the Palestinians’ political and geographical split between the West Bank and Gaza. The Palestinians demand that the border of their new state should follow the green line, giving them 22% of their historic land. But Israel, which has built hundreds of settlements on the Palestinian side of the green line over the past 50 years, insists that most of these should become part of Israel – requiring a new border which would mean, according to critics, the annexation of big chunks of the West Bank. Land swaps could go some way to compensate but negotiations have stalled on this fundamental issue. Jerusalem is another obstacle. Israel has said it cannot agree any deal which sees the city shared or divided between the two sides. The Palestinians say they will not cede their claim and access to their holy sites, all of which are located in East Jerusalem, on the Palestinian side of the green line. Facebook Twitter Pinterest John Kerry: Israel must adopt two-state solution for lasting peace The Palestinians have long insisted that refugees from the 1948 war and their descendants should have the right to return to their former homes, although many diplomats believe they would settle for a symbolic “right of return”. Israel rejects any movement on this issue. Israel insists that the Palestinians must recognise Israel as a “Jewish state”. The Palestinians say this would deny the existence of the one in five Israeli citizens who are Palestinian. Any potential deal is complicated by the political breach between Fatah and Hamas, the two main Palestinian factions, and the geographical split between the West Bank and Gaza. Can it still happen? For years, international diplomats, Palestinians and some Israelis have been warning that time is running out as Israel’s continued settlement expansion swallows up land that would become part of Palestine. Many Palestinians and some Israelis now say the line has already been crossed and the two-state solution is impossible; privately many diplomats agree. What is Trump’s view? During his election campaign, Donald Trump pledged to move the US embassy to Jerusalem, a potentially explosive move as it would signal that the US considered the city to be Israel’s capital. The president-elect has also suggested that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict simply may not be a priority for his administration. He has appointed as US ambassador to Israel David Friedman, a fervent opponent of a two-state solution, a big supporter of settlement expansion and a vocal champion of an undivided Jerusalem as Israel’s “eternal capital”. Is there an alternative? The Israeli hard right has pushed for annexation of the West Bank, with its Palestinian population living permanently under military rule or being pressed to relocate to neighbouring Arab countries. Many Palestinians and some Israelis now advocate a “one-state solution”, with the focus turning to a civil rights campaign for Palestinians – who would soon be a majority in a binational state. This would effectively be the end of the Jewish homeland, and thus unacceptable to the vast majority of global Jews and many others.",diasaster:0},

The disclosures by Goldman, JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley and Bank of America Merrill Lynch show that 971 of their staff received €1m in 2015. The information was provided in regulatory disclosures instituted since the 2008 banking crisis, when it became apparent that bankers were being paid huge sums that could not be withheld when banks got into trouble.

Morgan Stanley, for instance, said that 40% to 60% of its pay deals were deferred over three years, with part of it in shares. Scrap bonuses?

Morgan Stanley’s data shows 198 staff received €1m or more and Bank of America Merrill Lynch shows 186 staff being handed €1m or more. The disclosures relate to legal entities based in the UK so the majority of the individuals involved will be based in the City, though some may be located in other parts of the EU. They help to shed light on the pay deals being offered in the City in the wake of the 2008 financial crash and at a time when the sector is facing scrutiny as a result of the vote to leave the EU.

The EBA’s data covered 2014, the first year of the cap that limits bonuses to 100% of salary, or 200% if shareholders approve. This has had the effect of shifting remuneration towards fixed salaries. In 2014, the average ratio between variable and fixed pay for high earners more than halved to 127% from 317% in 2013.

{ "title":"Obama set to hit Russia with further sanctions before leaving office", "content": "The outgoing US administration is poised to hit Russia with further sanctions before Barack Obama leaves office next month, in response to allegations of Russian hacking and interference in the US electoral process. The Obama administration has had a rocky relationship with Russia and has already imposed several rounds of sanctions on Moscow, mainly for its actions in Ukraine. The US president-elect, Donald Trump, by contrast, has repeatedly praised the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, and has dismissed claims that Russia intervened to get him elected. But the prominent Republican senator Lindsey Graham, a hardliner on Russia and a constant critic of Trump, told a news conference in Latvia that Congress would “investigate the Russian involvement in our elections”. “There will be bipartisan sanctions coming that will hit Russia hard, particularly Putin as an individual,” Graham told CNN. “I would say that 99 of us believe the Russians did this and we’re going to do something about it.” A recent report in the Washington Post said the White House was already close to announcing new sanctions on Russia in retaliation for the hacking. The White House did not respond to a request for comment on the report. The fate of new sanctions remains unclear, however, with Trump due to take over the White House in little more than three weeks. During the campaign, Trump not only suggested he might lift sanctions on Russia, but also said he would look into the possibility of recognising Crimea, annexed from Ukraine in 2014, as part of Russia. Asked by reporters at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida if the US should sanction Russia over hacking activities, Trump said on Wednesday: “I think we ought to get on with our lives. I think that computers have complicated lives very greatly. The whole age of computer has made it where nobody knows exactly what’s going on.” Rex Tillerson, Trump’s pick for secretary of state, has also raised eyebrows, given his long history of doing business with Russia as head of Exxon Mobil, and his close personal friendship with Igor Sechin, head of the Russian oil giant Rosneft. Sechin is one of Putin’s closest associates, and is on the US sanctions list. Tillerson said in 2014 that Exxon did not support sanctions in general because they were hard to implement effectively. At an economic forum in Russia earlier this year, he laughed off a question on sanctions, while saying he agreed with “my friend Mr Sechin”. Not all the sanctions currently in place would be easy for Trump to revoke, even if he wanted to do so. Most difficult would be those against Russian individuals implicated in human rights abuses, linked to the Magnitsky Act, named after the whistleblowing lawyer Sergei Magnitsky, who died in prison. They were put in place in 2013 using an act of Congress, and as such Congress would be required to revoke them. It is likely that the White House would also ensure any new sanctions related to hacking could not be easily rescinded by Trump. However, the wider ranging sanctions that were introduced by the Obama administration over Russia’s annexation of Crimea and meddling in east Ukraine were implemented by presidential executive order, and as such could be revoked by Trump with the stroke of a pen. Were Trump to do so, European businesses would put major pressure on their governments to lift EU sanctions as well, so as not to allow US companies an unfair advantage on the Russian market. In a televised interview last week, Putin’s spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia was hoping for “new, fresher and more constructive approaches” from Trump’s administration. He said Russia would welcome further dialogue but was not pushing for sanctions to be lifted. “We didn’t initiate the sanctions dialogue and we won’t initiate their removal,” said Peskov. He said Russia and the US had not been particularly affected by sanctions, unlike European agricultural producers, who suffered losses from Russia’s counter-sanctions banning the imports of many food items. However, there is no doubt that Russia would be extremely pleased to see the sanctions gone, not least because of the broader redefinition of the relationship it would signify. There have also been US business voices keen for the sanctions to be dropped. Alexis Rodzianko, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Russia, said: “The sanctions have been annoying and unhelpful for business interests. They had a direct impact, in the banking sanctions, and an indirect impact in that attitude towards US business.” Brian Zimbler, managing partner at Morgan Lewis law firm in Moscow, said: “There is intense interest in Russia about future US policy, and lots of speculation that sanctions may be reduced or removed next year. “Reduced sanctions would open up new opportunities to obtain funding for Russian-based projects, and potentially generate momentum for increased foreign investment in Russia, which has fallen to low levels.” Bilateral ties have been extremely strained since Russia’s annexation of Crimea and the sanctions. US diplomats say they have been routinely harassed by Russian authorities. Footage released over the summer showed a diplomat rugby tackled to the ground by a policeman while trying to get back inside the embassy compound. The diplomat was later accused of spying and expelled. In June, the foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said: “Diplomacy is based on reciprocity. The more the US damages relations, the harder it will be for US diplomats to work in Russia.” Russian officials, who cheered Trump’s victory, are hoping he will launch a complete overhaul of western policy towards the country, including sanctions. “Officially nothing has changed, but the mood has changed perceptibly. It’s like a pre-honeymoon honeymoon period. They are openly happy, but only time will tell if they are right to be,” said Rodzianko.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Bovis profit warning takes investors by surprise", "content": "Bovis Homes, one of Britain’s biggest housebuilders, has issued a profit warning, sending shivers through the sector. Bovis said it would complete about 180 fewer homes than expected this year, blaming operational issues. It expects between 3,950 and 4,000 completions, rather than the 4,170 forecast by the City, a fall that will affect profits. Bovis now expects pre-tax profit for 2016 of £160m-£170m, compared with analysts’ forecasts of about £183m. Revenues are expected to total £1.04-£1.06bn. “We have experienced slower-than-expected build production across the group’s sites during December, resulting in approximately 180 largely built and sold private homes that were expected to complete in 2016 being deferred into early 2017,” it said. The unscheduled stock market announcement, which followed a prediction of record annual revenues in November, took investors by surprise. Shares in Bovis dropped by 5.3% to 811p, making it the biggest faller on the FTSE 250. Other housebuilders were also hit, including Persimmon, Barratt, Crest Nicholson and Berkeley Group. Russ Mould, investment director at the stockbroker AJ Bell, said: “A profit warning from FTSE 250 firm Bovis is another crack in the wall when it comes to the housebuilders sector.” Bovis insisted there was no impact from the Brexit vote in June. A spokesman said there had been delays in getting the final sign-off for 180 houses before the end of the year, so people had not moved in yet – a logistical issue rather than a fundamental problem, he said. The production delays mean that instead of 5% growth in house completions this year, there will be growth of 0% to 2%. Mould said the numbers implied that completions in the second half fell by 1%-2% year on year, “raising questions as to whether the market is slowing down in a post-Brexit [vote] world after all”. Bovis said its average sale price was up by about 10% this year to £255,000. Mould said this implied a “marked second-half deceleration, as prices rose 14% to an average of £254,500 in the first six months of this year”. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Photograph: Company accounts/AJ Bell The housebroker Numis cut its 2016 profit forecast by 11% to £165m, but left its 2017 estimate unchanged at £196m. The Numis analyst Chris Millington said: “Obviously it is disappointing to reduce forecasts again and in our view this reflects company-specific factors, with the fundamentals of the new-build market remaining robust [although with flatter house price inflation and some cost inflation] due to the help-to-buy scheme and low mortgage rates.” The coming year is set to be the first since the financial crash of 2008 in which the UK builds 200,000 homes, the housebuilder Redrow predicted on Wednesday. The government has set a target of building 1m homes by 2020 and a £2.3bn housing infrastructure fund was unveiled in the autumn statement last month, which was welcomed by the industry.Shortly before the EU referendum, a group of 17 UK housebuilders – including Berkeley, Barratt and Crest Nicholson, but not Bovis – warned that a vote to leave the EU would make it harder and more expensive to build homes. The property market slowed straight after the Brexit vote but has held up better than expected along with the rest of the economy in the months since June. However, analysts expect the economy and house price growth to slow sharply next year. Savills, the upmarket estate agent, is forecasting that house prices will flatline next year after five years of increases, while Britain’s biggest mortgage lender, Halifax, is predicting growth of between 1% and 4% for the UK and price falls in London.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"UK's key role in brokering UN resolution on Israeli settlements confirmed", "content": "Britain played a key behind-the-scenes role in brokering the UN resolution condemning Israel for violating international law with its policy of building settlements on occupied Palestinian territory, it has been confirmed. The UK helped draft some of the key wording to ensure it met US concerns. The UK role, first highlighted by Israeli diplomatic sources, leaves the UK on a collision course not just with Israel, but at odds with Donald Trump, the US president-elect and a strong opponent of the UN resolution, the first to be passed that is critical of Israel for seven years. The UK has never hidden its support for the UN resolution, voting for its terms, and subsequently both UK ministers and diplomats have publicly justified its wording. It is also usual for the UK to play a key brokering role on UN resolutions, especially on the Middle East. It has been confirmed the UK helped with drafts of the resolution with Egypt and the Palestinians in a bid to ensure that it met with the concerns of the US president, Barack Obama. The US said it did not veto the resolution because it was balanced, condemning violence and incitement, as well as illegal settlements. The US has insisted it did not draft the text, and did not even tell other delegations how it intended to vote in the key consultations process. Formally the Foreign Office did not deny it had been involved in the drafting process. It stressed “the resolution was proposed and drafted by the Egyptian delegation”, adding that the UK, as one of the five permanent members of the security council, “engaged with” the text “as we do with all security council texts”. Israel claims the UK’s diplomatic activity in New York, conducted in liaison with the French and the US, took place behind its back. It is dubious that the US played a hands-off role. Israel’s ambassador to the US, Ron Dermer, speaking to the US media this week, said: “This is not a text that was formulated by the Palestinians or Egypt, but by a western power.” It was not clear if this was a reference to the US or the UK. In particular the UK is thought to have played a major role in mediating between the Palestinians and the Americans to ensure the text eventually put forward by New Zealand, and not Egypt, met the concerns of both sides. The UK in conjunction with Gulf states said the resolution should go ahead even when Egypt decided not to sponsor it. A last-minute glitch came up when Russia’s ambassador to the United Nations, Vitaly Churkin, proposed postponing the vote until after Christmas, according to an interview the deputy Russian ambassador to Israel gave on Israel Army Radio. This reportedly followed a phone call between the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and the Russian president, Vladi­mir Putin. The other security council ambassadors refused to wait, however. The UK Foreign Office minister Tobias Ellwood welcomed the UN resolution on Twitter, and the UK ambassador to the UN, Matthew Rycroft, also highlighted the UK support for the resolution. The British foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, has not so far issued any public statement either way, but it is not claimed this is significant. The UK support for the UN resolution has already led to reports that a tentatively planned meeting between Theresa May, and Netanyahu scheduled for Davos international summit this month has been cancelled. The UK role has divided opinion inside the Conservative party. Conservative Friends of Israel’s parliamentary chairman, Sir Eric Pickles, said: “CFI is disappointed by the UK’s decision to support the controversial UN security council resolution, which legitimises the Palestinian Authority’s attempts to internationalise the issue and avoid the necessary direct peace talks. “In addition, the resolution will embolden the hardline BDS movement and the ramifications for Jerusalem and Judaism’s holiest site – the Western Wall – are seriously troubling.” By contrast the Conservative Middle East council said the resolution affirmed the “establishment by Israel of settlements in the Palestinian territory occupied since 1967, including east Jerusalem, has no legal validity and constitutes a flagrant violation under international law and a major obstacle to the achievement of the two-state solution”. The UK is also backing the French-hosted Middle East conference on 15 January, where more than 70 countries may endorse an international framework, including a two-state solution for peace between Israel and the Palestinians. Israel has long vowed not to attend, with the Israeli defence minister, Avigdor Lieberman, comparing the summit to “a modern version of the Dreyfus trial” at a meeting of his party’s deputies. Israel says it will only hold bilateral talks with the Palestinians.",diasaster:0},

She wouldn’t have normally, but there was something different about her that day. Perhaps it was the shoes – chunky silver platforms covered in glitter which caught the light wherever they went. “They were £6 in a closing-down sale,” she told me. “It’d be rude not to buy them.” It was New Year’s Eve and we were finishing up a belated Christmas dinner. I’d spent Christmas Day with my in-laws and this was our surrogate celebration, but now it was time for Mum to go and she was gathering up her things. The blinking lights from the Christmas tree bounced off her wedding-best bangles, unboxed just once this year, and in the low light the shoes spoke to me. Mum was nowhere to be found. I wandered around until my ears tuned in to cheering on the dancefloor They said two words: disco inferno. I had a change of heart. A nearby mega-pub had a large back room it used for occasional club nights, playing that specific brand of inoffensive, decade-old pop you’d probably hear at a wedding. That in itself was significant. My mum doesn’t “do” pubs; she doesn’t “do” drinking, even in moderation. Drinking was a source of conflict between us, but it wasn’t really about the alcohol. Rather it was a symbol of something bigger, and not just in the obvious way: that I was becoming “westernised”. It was everything else that followed. My hunt for hedonism regularly took me into central London. On breaks from university, I would temp in the City. I made friends there; I slept on their couches. When I came back to our modest council house, I talked about avant-garde theatre, cocktail bars and essays about Karl Marx in papers you could only read by subscription. I once corrected my mum’s pronunciation of fajita (she said it with a hard j) and I saw her eyes well up. “Pubs are for white people!” she would say as I slammed the door behind me. She wasn’t completely wrong about that. If I think about every time I’ve been really heinously abused for the colour of my skin, when I think about the times I’ve been truly afraid, a finger hovering over the call button having already typed in three nines, and if I think of the times I’ve been reminded I am a mere visitor in the nation in which I was born, they have been in a boozer. And now, here she was, in the pub: my mum. The queue for the bar was five deep and when I finally squeezed myself out of the scrum, Mum was nowhere to be found. I wandered around until my ears heard cheering from the dancefloor. Approaching the crowds, a familiar song came over the speakers. I’d recognise the Nile Rodgers-esque guitar intro anywhere. It was Mark Morrison’s Return of the Mack. I pushed past people until I fell into a clearing, at the centre of which was my mother, eyes closed and lost in her own world, doing what I can only describe as a kind of Bollywood dad dance – noticeably retro, creaky and totally out of time to the music. One hand was on her hip as she slowly shuffled around in a circle; the other arm was up, her hand doing a kind of exaggerated “come hither” gesture synonymous with Hindi dance (especially from the 70s). People were surrounding her, whooping and cheering: “Go Saima, go Saima, go go go Saima!” I laughed, touched to the heart. Then I noticed a group of three lads also laughing, perhaps a little too hard. One of them was recording my mum on his phone, while another stood in between her and the camera as though he was “presenting” the video. The presenter was copying my mum’s dance while throwing in a couple of stereotypical gestures. He clasped his head in a namaste gesture and gave a little head wobble, followed by a bow to the camera. They were laughing at her. Was everybody? What’s your New Year resolution? This can be the cruellest question | Linda Tirado Read more Before I’d had a chance to gather my thoughts, the countdown to midnight began; people were kissing and hugging – now really was not the time to start a fight. Mum practically skipped home, regaling me with stories about how, before she got married, people said she could have been a dancer, and did I know that she even had an audition once? I didn’t mention what I’d seen. In the weeks after that, I thought a lot about those lads, and looked for them every time I went to the pub. I wanted to know what, or who, the joke was and why exactly it was so funny. I even decided to search online to see if they’d uploaded the video. By the end of the search I’d watched hours of grainy, shaky footage: a slightly different accent here, a different outfit there, all seemingly hilarious for reasons I didn’t want to think about. But in all those videos, I never found my mum. I still don’t understand why that night was so significant. Each time I try to figure it out, I come to a dead end.

Two hours after François Hollande gave her a complete pardon, Jacqueline Sauvage, 69, was seen leaving a prison southeast of Paris after spending more than three years behind bars. Hollande had issued a partial pardon at the end of January, but the courts twice rejected applications for her release. The case drew public attention to the issue of domestic abuse. Facebook Twitter Pinterest ‘Total pardon for Jacqueline Sauvage’ – a protester at a demonstration calling for the release of Jacqueline Sauvage. Photograph: Francois Guillot/AFP/Getty Images Two different juries had sentenced Sauvage to 10 years in prison for fatally shooting her husband, Norbert Marot, three times in the back with a hunting rifle in 2012. During the trials in 2014 and 2015, Sauvage said her late husband had beaten her for 47 years. The couple’s adult daughters also claimed Marot had abused them. Neither Sauvage nor the daughters ever filed a complaint against him. The three women said they were too humiliated to seek help and instead suffered violence that included sexual abuse silently behind closed doors. In a statement, the Elysée Palace said Hollande decided: “The place of Ms. Sauvage was no longer in prison, but with her family.” Women’s rights advocates, politicians and sympathisers around France had mobilised to support Sauvage, with a petition calling for her to be pardoned signed by hundreds of thousands. Nathalie Tomasini, one of Sauvage’s lawyers, told RTL radio the pardon was a “very strong message sent by François Hollande to all women victims of domestic violence.” Actress Éva Darlan, who chairs a support committee that advocated for Sauvage, said on BFM television that the presidential pardon is a “strong gesture toward men who hit [women]”. In January, Hollande granted a partial pardon to Sauvage, allowing her to seek parole. But two more courts made up of professional magistrates refused to free her. The president of the main union of French magistrates said Hollande made a “deplorable” decision “to please the public and to respond to a media request.” “It is a political decision … that challenges the functioning of our institutions,” Virginie Duval said on BFM.

{ "title":"Airbus forced to postpone delivery of 12 A380 jets to Emirates", "content": "Airbus has suffered yet another hitch in the troubled life of its A380 “superjumbo”, as it was forced to postpone delivery of 12 aircraft to its largest customer, Emirates. The double-decker A380, the world’s largest passenger jet, has proved a disappointment for Airbus since its much-delayed debut in 2007 and the firm has already been forced to cut production after winning fewer orders than expected. The latest obstacle to throw the €25bn (£21bn) aircraft programme off course has left analysts questioning whether executives at Airbus might consider cancelling it altogether. The Toulouse-based aviation firm said it would delay delivery to Emirates of six jets due to arrive next year until 2018, with a further six put back from 2018 to 2019. The postponement is said to be linked to technical issues Emirates is having with the new Rolls-Royce Trent 900 engines it has ordered for its fleet of A380s. It comes days after Airbus revealed that an order from Iran Air for 100 planes, some of which were expected to be A380s, did not include the aircraft at all. Airbus developed the A380, which can carry 850 passengers, believing that airlines would turn to larger jets to feed more people through hub airports serving a growing number of “megacities”. This vision of the future prompted the firm – part-owned by the French, German and Spanish governments – to predict huge demand for the giant twin-aisle, four-engine planes. Despite cost overruns and long delays that cost several executives their jobs, the jet eventually took to the skies for its first public flight in 2007 to great acclaim from its early passengers. But stagnant economic growth and a lack of orders from countries such as the US and Japan have forced Airbus to rein in production. It has delivered just 193 superjumbos and has only a further 126 orders left to fulfil, having initially predicted demand for 1,200 over two decades. At the same time, smaller but longer range twin-engine jets with large cargo capacity – such as Boeing’s 777 – have proved popular because airlines see them as less risky economically. John Strickland, a veteran aviation industry analyst and director of JLS Consulting, said the A380 was well-liked but that there had not been a sufficient market for it so far. “It’s regarded as a fantastic aircraft by the airlines that have taken it. [IAG chief executive] Willie Walsh has praised it, [Emirates chief executive] Tim Clark has praised it. They say passengers even choose it, asking to go on an A380 if there’s a choice. “But these days, given the economic climate, airlines are more risk-averse and the A380 has a lot of seats to fill.” Airbus has said that it can break even at an annual production rate of 20 A380s, which carry an order book price of $430m but are typically sold at a discount. It beat this target in 2015, with 27 rolling off the production line, but a slowdown in orders forced the company to slash scheduled annual deliveries to just 12 from 2018. The firm is also cutting costs to make up for the shortfall in income. Strickland said Airbus now faced a difficult decision over whether to continue making the jet at a loss in the hope that its patience would be rewarded within a few years. “So the question is whether Airbus can get through this challenging period to the brighter future which they envision, where airlines are falling over themselves to get hold of larger planes,” he said. “They will have to keep it under continuous review because it’s a commercially driven business, even though it’s government-owned. “They have many other calls on their investment. At the moment it’s a greater risk to throw in the towel, but there’s a challenge of how to maintain very low levels of production if you’re actually losing money.” The aviation analyst Alex Macheras said the A380 was highly popular with passengers and had created an “overall feeling that this is what all modern day airliners should feel like”. But he also cast doubt on how long Airbus could remain loyal to the aircraft, which was conceived and developed before the tenure of the current chief executive, Tom Enders. “There is the sad reality that not enough airlines are ordering A380s to keep the production alive for as long as Airbus would have liked,” said Macheras. “Emirates are taking the majority of the remaining A380s on order, and so with a delay to their deliveries, it doesn’t leave a demand for many A380 air frames for other carriers.” But he said Airbus could take solace from the potential success story of its new A350-1000 plane, which is due to enter service next year.",diasaster:0},

The A40 was closed in both directions after the pile-up, which stretched for more than half a mile (1km), the ambulance service said. The female motorist, who was in her 50s, was declared dead at the scene, while a man and a woman were taken to hospital with serious injuries, Thames Valley police said. A further 10-15 casualties were treated at the scene after several collisions at about 8.25am, David Gallagher, a spokesman for South Central ambulance service, said. The accident took place in heavy fog, and with temperatures as low as -5C (23F), according to the Met Office. Similar conditions are expected to continue on Thursday, with fog covering large parts of southern England. A40 map Images showed the mangled wreckage of several of the cars involved, with debris strewn across the road. Six vehicles were reported to be badly damaged, while a further 10-15 were also involved, with the most serious injuries happening in the middle of the pile-up. The incident is likely to cause major disruption for many people travelling across the country after the Christmas break, as the road connects London to Wales. The A40 eastbound remained closed on Wednesday afternoon as investigations continued, and police expected the rest of the carriageway to reopen at about 7.30pm. One lane of the westbound carriageway was reopened at 2pm and police said the other lane was expected to be back in use once the central reservation was repaired. Gallagher said: “There was a collision towards the front of the queue and the more serious one about halfway down.” He said three ambulances, three rapid response vehicles, two ambulance officers and an air ambulance car had attended the scene. A Thames Valley police spokesman said: “Officers were called today at about 8.25am following reports of a collision involving multiple vehicles on the A40, Witney. “Officers are at the scene along with the fire and rescue services. A number of people are believed to have been injured. Road closures are currently in place, and drivers are advised to avoid the area.” Ami Gaston, a pregnant mother of two from Carterton, was in a car with her partner when she saw the first vehicle crash. She said the accident happened about half a mile from the Witney exit, blocking the right lane. “A man on his own had skidded and crashed into the middle barrier. My partner was driving – we had to swerve out of the right lane to avoid hitting him. His door was open and airbags were released,” Gaston said. “I phoned an ambulance but couldn’t stop. My partner wouldn’t stop because I am 20 weeks pregnant and didn’t want to put us in danger.” She said heavy fog meant the situation was “really dangerous”, as it was difficult to see any other car until you were “on top of it”. Another eyewitness arrived at the scene later and described the “carnage” as multiple cars swerved and crashed on the busy road. The woman, who asked not to be named, said she “luckily” saw hazard warning lights ahead as she approached on the slip road from Carterton, and moved on to a grass verge before witnessing the pile-up. “I saw cars going zooming past me and trying to swerve out the way of the stationary cars but crashing into them,” she said. “I saw one car try to swerve in between a Mini and another car, ending up crashing into the Mini and [flying] up in the air. I saw two cars swerve as they braked so hard and go flying into the barrier in the middle of the road … it was carnage.”",diasaster:0},

Her eye for the entertaining anarchies of old age was also deployed in The Vicar of Dibley and 2point4 Children. However, Smith is likely to be best remembered for her work as Norma Speakman, or Nana, in The Royle Family, the groundbreaking comedy written by Caroline Aherne and Craig Cash, for which Smith won a Bafta nomination.

Her mother died in childbirth when Betty was two and she was brought up by her widowed grandmother.

When she was seven, her father walked out without explanation – his daughter only discovering, many years later, that he had married another woman who had insisted that his previous life did not exist. “He was a weak man and did as he was told, so he just disowned me,” she recalled in the later years of her success. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Liz Smith with Max Wall in We Think the World of You, 1988. Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo She discovered acting at her local school but left at 16 and took a job with a dressmaker. During the second world war she served in the Women’s Royal Naval Service and in 1945 married a sailor, Jack Thomas, whom she met on service in India. She contracted hepatitis and returned to London. In 1947, she managed to get a job with a small repertory company called the Gateway theatre in Westbourne Grove, using the stage name Liz Smith. But she and her husband and their children, Sarah and Robert, soon moved out to Buckhurst Hill, near Epping, Essex, which put the repertory theatre out of range. The marriage ended in divorce in 1959. Acting was both an emotional release and a way of earning a living. The American director Charles Marowitz, a devotee of the Method school of acting, introduced his ideas to London at rooms in Fitzroy Square, London. Smith was auditioned and chosen to be in the first improvising group. Marowitz did not pay her, and only a series of day jobs, including one as a postwoman, made it possible for her to attend his school for four nights a week over a period of five years. Then, one day, Marowitz simply did not turn up and Smith was told he had gone to link up with the Royal Shakespeare Company. “And that was that. He dropped us – just like Father,” Smith said. She then joined the Forbes Russell Repertory Company, which played at Butlin’s holiday camps.

For Bleak Moments in 1971, Leigh could find the children he wanted but not the eccentric mother, because it was difficult to find actors used to improvisation. Smith, who rarely gave media interviews, once told of how she was selling toys in Hamley’s at Christmas when Leigh told her he needed a middle-aged woman to do improvisations. Smith was cast as a woman who could not leave her bed, so she stayed in bed for the six weeks of rehearsals and shooting. She later said that Bleak Moments, which was Leigh’s first film, “changed my life” and cued up an exhaustive list of TV credits. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Liz Smith in 1984. Photograph: Popperfoto/Getty Images Leigh was so satisfied with Smith that he cast her again in his first television play, Hard Labour, this time as a charwoman. She scrubbed the floors of the Territorial Army hall in which rehearsals took place until her stockings were full of holes and she was satisfied that she knew what a charwoman really felt like. Smith found her first agent in 1973 and began to work steadily, mostly for television, from Dickens to The Sweeney. By the 1980s she was an established face who did not lack work. Her films included Lindsay Anderson’s Britannia Hospital (1982) and Malcolm Mowbray’s A Private Function (1984), for which she won the Bafta award for best supporting actress. In 1988 she played the mother of a young gay hustler in We Think the World of You, directed by Colin Gregg and starring Alan Bates. The following year, for Peter Greenaway, she appeared in the film The Cook, The Thief, His Wife and Her Lover. Her late-life successes included Letitia Cropley, a provider of ghastly cakes, in The Vicar of Dibley. When the popular character was killed off by the writer Richard Curtis, the first Smith heard of it was when a motorcycle messenger came to her door with next week’s script, accompanied by a note reading, “Here is a script for the next episode, which contains your death.” She confessed to being hurt and bewildered.

She was Grandma Georgina in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (2005) and the voice of Mrs Mulch in Wallace and Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit in the same year. When well into her 70s, she said she was always “completely energised” by work. Smith, who often complained that whatever she did on stage made the audience laugh, appeared when she was in her 80s in a 2004 production of Samuel Beckett’s Endgame at the Albery theatre, with Michael Gambon, who thought her “bloody marvellous”. In 2009, she announced that she was retiring from acting following a stroke. But in 2010 she appeared in The Young Ones for the BBC, in which older celebrities reminisced about the 1970s.

Both events sent shock waves through financial markets and will have repercussions for businesses in the year ahead. Even without the political turmoil, 2016 was a dramatic year for business leaders. The collapse of BHS led to intense pressure on Sir Philip Green and demands that he fill the £571m hole in the store chain’s pension fund, while Mike Ashley was summoned before MPs to explain the working practices the Guardian had exposed at Sport Direct’s Derbyshire warehouse. MP hits back after Sir Philip Green calls BHS collapse report 'bizarre' Read more The annual general meeting season started with a bang when two FTSE 100 companies – BP and Smith & Nephew – had their pay schemes voted down. There were also big events in industry, with Nissan securing a post-Brexit deal, approval for the Hinkley Point C nuclear power station and concerns over the commitment of Indian company Tata to its UK steel plants. So as the year draws to close, who were the winners and losers in the business world in 2016 – and who has most at stake in the year ahead? Losers No sooner had 2016 begun, that Marc Bolland, the chief executive of Marks & Spencer, announced he was leaving. His successor, M&S lifer Steve Rowe, scaled back the retailer’s international expansion and announced plans to close stores and convert 45 sites into food-only outlets. By the end of the year, Robert Swannell, the chairman, announced his retirement. It was not long before another chief executive, Katherine Garrett-Cox also left. She walked away from the investment trust firm Alliance Trust in March when her role became obsolete in a restructuring that followed a long-lasting tussle with activist investors. By the end of the year, the Dundee-based firm outlined a dramatic plan to outsource the management of its investment funds. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Katherine Garrett-Cox.

The company said she had doubled profits and revenues during her tenure – but the shine was taken off by a profit warning three weeks earlier that knocked 25% of the share price. Phil Bentley, who used to run British Gas and Cable & Wireless Communications, took over. Bosses at a string of companies faced revolts. Besides BP and Smith & Nephew, companies as diverse as engineering group Weir, Shire Pharmaceuticals, estate agent Foxtons and betting company Paddy Power Betfair were also subjected to pay rebellions. Ashley’s problems began at the end of 2015, when the Guardian revealed how his retail empire was effectively paying below the minimum wage. He spent 2016 dealing with the consequences. The Newcastle United owner was hauled before MPs, and at an open day at his warehouse in Shirebrook, Derbyshire, he stunned observers by producing a wad of £50 notes from his pocket during a security check. The company’s shares have crumbled from about 570p to below 300p. There has been better news for Sports Direct workers, who have been promised back pay. For BHS workers, though, the news was dire. In August, BHS tores closed their doors for the last time after 88 years of trading. A parliamentary inquiry was looking into why the chain collapsed barely a year after being sold by Sir Philip Green to the thrice-bankrupt entrepreneur Dominic Chappell. A damning report by MPs concluded the business had been subjected to “systematic plunder” by former owners. MPs voted to strip Green of his knighthood, although the vote was purely symbolic and carried no official sanction. A deal to plug a £571m deficit in the pension fund is yet to be secured. Navinder Singh Sarao spent most of the year fighting extradition to face charges that he had been “spoofing” markets from his parents’ house in Hounslow, west London. Eventually extradited, Sarao appeared in a Chicago court and pleaded guilty. Martyn Dodgson’s conviction for insider dealing was secured using evidence from bugged offices, CCTV images and a crucial password of “Lamborghini55”. The former Deutsche Bank managing director was jailed for four and half years. His friend Andrew Hind was jailed for three and half years for acting as his middleman. Three others were acquitted. Four former Barclays bankers were sentenced to between 33 months and six-and-a-half years in jail for conspiring to rig global benchmark interest rates. Just before Christmas, former BlackRock fund manager Mark Lyttleton was jailed for a year after pleading guilty to insider dealing through a Panamanian company in the name of his wife.

Winners Andrew Bailey’s year started with his unexpected appointment as chief executive of the Financial Conduct Authority. Poached from the Bank of England, where he was one of the deputy governors, Bailey made a number of eye-catching moves after taking the helm in the summer. Crowdfunding, the fund management industry, high-cost consumer credit and the spread-betting industry are in his sights. Executives enjoyed big pay days. Sir Martin Sorrell, chief executive of advertising company WPP, received £70.4m in cash and shares. It was one of the biggest pay deals in UK corporate history – and was opposed by a third of the company’s shareholders. Simon Segars and Mike Muller at ARM Holdings shared a payout of £55m when the British microchip designer was sold to Japan’s SoftBank for £24bn. Angus Thirlwell and Peter Harris, the founders of luxury chocolate maker Hotel Chocolat, received £43m when the business was floated on AIM in May. And after a difficult 2015, Ivan Glasenberg, boss of mining company Glencore, had a good end to 2016 as the share price in the natural resources group rallied from from 85p to about 270p, boosting the value of his personal shareholding from £1bn to £3.2bn. Revealed: how Sports Direct effectively pays below minimum wage Read more Carmaker Nissan secured a deal from the government to seek tariff-free access to the single market when EU exit negotiations start. The Japanese company announced it would turn its Sunderland factory into one of the biggest car plants in the world, saving more than 7,000 jobs. While the news was good for Nissan workers, the prospects for workers at Tata Steel’s plants were mixed. The Scunthorpe works was saved by a rescue deal in June, led by Greybull, the family investment firm. In Port Talbot, workers are still awaiting confirmation of a deal with the Pensions Regulator. The on-off Hinkley Point C nuclear power station was finally given the go-ahead after the government signed an £18bn contract with French utilities firms EdF and China to start construction at the site in Somerset.

However, the competition commissioner, Margrethe Vestager, later said the full amount may not be payable to Ireland. In the empire-building stakes, supermarket chain Sainsbury’s won control of Argos, Shire Pharmaceuticals took over Baxalta, ABInBev, the world’s biggest brewer, completed its £79bn acquisition of SAB Miller and as the year drew to a close, Rupert Murdoch’s 21st Century Fox lodged an £11.7bn bid to take full control of Sky. The London Stock Exchange and Deutsche Börse also announced a merger. Ones to watch Emma Walmsley Even before she gets started as chief executive of GlaxoSmithKline, Walmsley is already being described as the most powerful woman in the FTSE 100. When she takes charge in March, Walmsley faces shareholders pushing for a breakup of the pharmaceutical business. Her background is in the consumer arm: Sensodyne toothpaste, Horlicks malted drinks and Panadol painkillers. Paula Nickolds Nickolds is taking over as the first female chief executive of John Lewis, replacing Andy Street, who has stepped down to run as the Tory candidate for mayor of Birmingham. Nickolds, who once considered a teaching career, started as a graduate trainee at John Lewis in 1994 and climbed the ladder through buying roles in clothing and furniture, before becoming buying and brand director. In the latter role, Nickolds had responsibility for the all-important Christmas ad, including 2013’s bear and the hare animation. She was named commercial director last year, with responsibility for shops and product development. It’s a big gig, running “middle England’s” favouite department store, but she is taking over at a tricky time: profits slumped 31% to £32m in the first half of this year as the chain struggled to adapt to the shift to online shopping.

Ross McEwan The New Zealander who runs Royal Bank of Scotland will be hoping to reach a settlement with the Department of Justice over a bond mis-selling scandal and find a buyer for 300 branches that must be sold under state aid penalties imposed by Brussels. Until these are resolved, the Treasury will struggle to sell off its 73% stake in the bank. In February, RBS will announce its ninth consecutive year of losses – which have already topped £50bn since its bailout. Sean Clarke Already six months into his role running Asda, the UK arm of US retail giant Walmart, Clarke has inherited a business that has dropped into third place out of four big UK supermarkets. A Briton who has had a global career, Clarke will need to use all the expertise of the Walmart empire to fight back against the German discounters Aldi and Lidl. Asda’s selling point has been price. Clarke will need to find another reason to get shoppers through the door. Facebook Twitter Pinterest An Asda supermarket.

Keith Hellawell The clock is ticking on the former police officer’s tenure as chairman of Sports Direct. In September, 53% of the embattled retailer’s independent shareholders voted against his re-election to the role. In January, another vote will be called. He is likely to survive it – as this time 55% shareholder Mike Ashley gets a say – but he has pledged to stand down if the majority of independent shareholders vote against him at the next AGM. Andy Parker The boss of Capita ended 2016 on a sour note after the outsourcing company issued two profit warnings in three months. The blame is being placed on Brexit and problems with IT for London’s congestion charging zone. The shares dived to 10-year lows, putting pressure on Parker, who has been running the outsourcing company since 2014 and will want to avoid taking the axe to the dividend. Marco Gobbetti: the man tasked with putting Burberry back in fashion Read more Marco Gobbetti The chief executive designate of Burberry will not take the helm until the middle of the year – 12 months after his appointment was announced in a move that marked the end of Christopher Bailey’s unusual dual role as creative director and chief executive. Gobbetti won plaudits while running the French luxury brand Celine, and Bailey, who will become president and focus on his role as creative director, welcomed him with a promise of a “wonderfully collaborative relationship”. 2017 will be the test of that. Jamie Dimon As chief executive of America’s biggest bank, JP Morgan, Dimon’s words and actions will be of particular interest in the UK in 2017. In the run-up to the 23 June referendum, Dimon had warned that 4,000 jobs were at risk if there was a vote for Brexit. The bank employs 19,000 people across the UK in Canary Wharf, Bournemouth and Glasgow and any move by JP Morgan to start shifting jobs could set the tone for other banks. Alex Cruz Six months into taking control of British Airways in a management reshuffle, Cruz ended 2016 having staved off strike action by baggage handlers, check-in staff and cabin crew.

{ "title":"Richard Adams obituary", "content": "Richard Adams, who has died aged 96, was the author of one of the most successful books of the 1970s. Published in 1972, Watership Down, Adams’s story about a colony of rabbits travelling across the country in search of a better home in the Berkshire Downs when their burrow is destroyed, became a cult novel, with a “crossover” readership. Despite being published as an adult book, Watership Down won the two most distinguished children’s book prizes, the Carnegie medal and the Guardian children’s book prize, and sold more than 100,000 copies in Britain in its first year of publication. Unlike some such instant successes, Watership Down was not just a book of its time; it is now firmly established as a classic and has sold more than 50m copies worldwide. The story of the publication of Watership Down is an example of the quirky nature of publishing. As a manuscript of more than 200,000 words, it was turned down by all of the major publishers and many of the smaller ones, before Rex Collings, a small independent company, picked it up. From the moment of publication, it was widely hailed as an exceptional title and almost instantly became a bestseller. At one point, it held the record for the highest sum paid for paperback rights. Its mass success and cult status was furthered by its subsequent adaptation in 1978 to animated cartoon film, with a soundtrack that included the hit single Bright Eyes. The origins of Watership Down lay in stories Adams wrote down to entertain his daughters on long car journeys, based on his observation of rabbits from the train window on his daily commute to work. However, Adams himself did not categorise it as a children’s book. Once published, its evocation of the English countryside (the Downs near Adams’s home), combined with its detailed descriptions of rabbit society – much taken from RM Lockley’s The Private Life of the Rabbit (1964) – which includes a sharply observed study of leadership through the characters of Fiver, Bigwig and Hazel, made it as much a political allegory as a simple adventure story. Son of Evelyn Adams, a country doctor, and his wife, Lilian (nee Button), Richard was born in Newbury, and brought up in Berkshire. He was educated at Bradfield college, Berkshire, and Worcester College, Oxford, where he studied history for two years until he was called up in 1940. He served in the Royal Army Service Corps in Palestine, Europe and the far east before returning to Oxford in 1946 to finish his studies. Adams then joined the civil service, where he worked in the Ministry of Housing and Local Government and in the Department of the Environment, before becoming a full-time writer in 1974 after the success of his first book. Subsequent books followed quickly, including Shardik (1974), the story of a hunter and a giant bear, which was particularly poorly received by readers wanting more Watership Down; The Tyger Voyage (1976), a picture book in verse with illustrations by Nicola Bayley; and The Plague Dogs (1977). None had the same success as the tale about rabbits. Adams was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of Literature in 1975 and held posts as writer in residence at both the University of Florida (1975) and Hollins University in Virginia (1976). He continued to write for both adults and children. He revisited Watership Down in Tales from Watership Down (1996) and contributed a short story to Gentle Footprints: A Collection of Animal Stories, which was published to raise funds for the Born Free Foundation in 2010, just before his 90th birthday. For almost all his writing, Adams drew on his deep affection for the countryside and the wildlife that lives in it that was formed during his childhood. In his autobiography, The Day Gone By (1990), he describes how, as a child, he lost his heart twice, once to the River Kennet and once to the Downs, of which he writes: “I can’t remember ever to have done anything – anything at all – more delightful than walking on the crest of the Downs, looking away to the purple, heat-rimmed edge of the horizon.” Adams was invited to become president of the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals in 1980, having been a lifelong campaigner for animal welfare and an active member of the society, including taking part in a lecture tour in Canada in 1977 to drum up opposition to the hunting of baby seals. In a subsequent RSPCA members watchdog publication Adams was described as giving a stirring and inspiring speech as president elect, but his time at the RSPCA was short lived. Already going through a turbulent time internally, as traditionalists and modernisers fought and tried to put right the £1m deficit that had accrued, the RSPCA council voted to shorten Adams’s term of office as president and he resigned in protest. He later commented angrily that senior members of the council were more interested in their own careers than in the welfare of animals. He continued to be honoured for his work throughout his life, and was the recipient of the inaugural Whitchurch arts award in 2010, given by the Hampshire town in which he lived in later years. Earlier this year, it was announced that the BBC planned a new adaptation of Watership Down for release in 2017. Adams married Elizabeth Acland in 1949, and they had two daughters, Juliet and Rosamond. They all survive him. • Richard George Adams, writer, born 9 May 1920; died 24 December 2016",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Monte dei Paschi shortfall €8bn, ECB says", "content": "The cost of rescuing Monte dei Paschi has escalated after the European Central Bank told the struggling Italian lender that it required €8.8bn (£7.5bn) to mend its finances. The lender, Italy’s third-largest bank, has tried in vain to arrange a €5bn rescue package with private investors but the ECB said the sum would not have been enough. Monte dei Paschi, whose history can be traced back to 1472, said it had asked the ECB to approve a “precautionary recapitalisation”, a type of state intervention that allows the institution receiving it to stay solvent. The government is now expected to inject €6.5bn into the bank, according to reports, taking its stake in to about 70%. The remainder will come from institutional investors seeing their bonds converted into shares, ridding the bank of about €2bn in debt. In a statement, Monte dei Paschi said the ECB had written to the Italian finance ministry warning that the bank’s liquidity position – its ability to turn assets into hard cash – had suffered a “rapid deterioration”. This was partly down to a large number of loans made to people who cannot pay them back, among the factors that saw Monte dei Paschi come last out of 51 banks in stress tests to check lenders’ resilience to economic shocks. “The bank has quickly started talks with the competent authorities to understand the methodologies underlying the ECB’s calculations and introduce the measures for a precautionary recapitalisation,” it said in a statement. Monte dei Paschi said the ECB had told it that the €8.8bn bailout figure was determined by the results of stress tests that the bank failed this summer. It also noted that the bank’s liquidity position had worsened between the end of November and 21 December. The European commission said on Friday it would work with Rome to establish conditions for a bailout of Monte dei Paschi, likely to involve tapping a €20bn rescue pot approved by the Italian government last week. But the proposals have not met with support from more hawkish official in the ECB. Jens Weidmann, the president of Germany’s Bundesbank and a member of the ECB’s governing council, said the Italian government ought to consider whether it should rescue the bank if it was in a bad financial state. “For the measures planned by the Italian government the bank has to be financially healthy at its core,” he said in an article published in the German newspaper Bild. “The money cannot be used to cover losses that are already expected. All this must be carefully examined.” Monte dei Paschi has struggled to recover from the 2008 banking crisis, when it paid Santander €9bn (£7.6bn) for Banca Antonveneta. The deal doubled the size of the lender, transforming it into Italy’s third largest behind UniCredit and Intesa Sanpaolo. Three years ago, Monte dei Paschi’s problems worsened and it was forced to ask the government for €4bn amid a scandal over loss-making derivatives contracts and alleged fraud. It will now go back to the government for funds after talks with private investors failed, with Qatar’s sovereign wealth fund thought to have scuppered the plan by refusing to take part. The Italian government already has a 4% stake in Monte dei Paschi.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"The Guardian view on climate change: bad for the Arctic", "content": "Not even donkeys get a worse deal in popular culture than the reindeer. Rabbits, mice, cats and even bears all have their distorted images in cartoons, but all of them show some sympathetic qualities of intelligence or kindness. Only the reindeer is forced in songs and cartoons to live down to the mangy and dispirited creatures chained up and sweating in rainy British theme parks. Even rats make cartoon heroes. Only reindeer are always caricatured as drunken, stupid and quarrelsome beasts of burden. In real life the partnership of the reindeer with the Sami peoples of northern Scandinavia is one of the great triumphs of domestication, enabling humans to build a culture in a landscape so cold, bare and hostile that without the reindeer it would have been impossible to live there at all. The Sami and their reindeer live far to the north of the Inuit of North America, and have for hundreds of years been pushed further into the wilderness by settled farmers encroaching from the south. Until recent times the reindeer supplied almost all the technology their herders needed: bone needles, and thread made of sinew to sew together warm clothes from skin. Together the herds and their herders travel hundreds of miles every year, in search of food, minimal warmth, and escape from mosquitoes. But it is important that the warmth not be too great. One of the greatest catastrophes that can befall a herd of reindeer is a warm spell in spring, where warmth is defined as anything above freezing. If in the daytime rain falls instead of snow, it will freeze into ice when the weather returns to normal and, while reindeer can dig through deep dry snow to reach the lichen on which they live, they cannot break through a crust of ice. The food remains as inaccessible as if it were behind glass. This is a natural disaster that can wipe out an entire population – about 60,000 reindeer died in one Siberian incident in 2013 – and even those animals that survive will be greatly weakened. Now there is evidence that this effect is attacking the wild reindeer population of the Svalbard archipelago as a result of climate change. That has progressed at an astonishing rate. The mean temperature in January has risen by nearly 10C in the last 26 years. In July, over the same period, it has only risen by a 1.5C, but both changes have had profound effects. The slightly warmer summers have crossed an important threshold for plant life, so that there is now a great deal more nourishment available in the fat times. But this seems to be outweighed by the loss of food caused by wintertime warming. It might seem that a warmer world would be unambiguous good news for the plant and animal life of the arctic. Indeed, there are now more reindeer in the population studied than there were 20 years ago. But the problem of rain refreezing over plants turns out to be more important than all the gains from plants growing larger in a longer summer. The average weight of reindeer on the island has shrunk by 12% over the last 16 years as the island has grown steadily less cold. Warm summers mean more adults, but the warm, or less cold, winters mean malnourished mothers that have fewer successful pregnancies and weaker babies if they are carried to term. The disruptions caused by climate change will be greater than we can easily imagine, and much less predictable.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Hilarious realist: Carrie Fisher was the person everyone would want to sit next to at a wedding", "content": "During the later decades of her life, Carrie Fisher became better known for her persona than her actual achievements, although she would probably argue that the shaping of this persona was an achievement in itself, and she would be right. The broken but not bowed survivor, the rehab graduate with black wit, the former Hollywood wild child who tells it like it is: those were the roles Fisher played, perfectly, to the day she died. I saw her perform live only once, when she monologued her life story, titled Wishful Drinking, on the New York stage – in the former Studio 54, appropriately enough, as quite a few of her life stories happened on that dance floor. Star writer: Carrie Fisher shines brightest in her books Read more But I’d also happened to have met her five years earlier, through a mutual friend who took me to Fisher’s house in Los Angeles. Although her show had plenty of attention-grabbing fodder – from Fisher’s parents’ absurdly famous divorce, to her sudden Star Wars celebrity when her face was on every kid’s lunchbox, to her well-documented (by her) addictions and mental illnesses – what struck me most was how Fisher on stage was pretty much identical to how Fisher was at home. That cynical self-deprecation, that black humour that could turn even the story about waking up next to a dead man into a knowing epigram: they were as much a part of her stage show as they were her chat on a Tuesday night in the kitchen. She was the person anyone would want to be sat next to at a wedding, because you know she would give you all the gossip about who the bride had slept with before and whether the groom was secretly gay. She was certainly the dream interviewee: to promote her return to Star Wars in The Force Awakens, she rocked up to Good Morning America, a popular US breakfast TV show, and brought along her dog, Gary, whose opinion she sought in answer to various questions. Was she wacky? She was often described as such, and if wacky means, as I suspect it does, a woman who doesn’t give a stuff about the rules of the game, then, yes, she was probably wacky. In that same interview, when the journalist mentioned that Fisher lost weight to get back on screen, Fisher replied, with a wry smile, “Yes, and I think that’s a stupid conversation.” And guess what? She was right. Carrie Fisher on Harrison Ford: ‘I love him. I'll always feel something for him’ Read more There’s no doubt that the persona Fisher carved for herself – etched out to perfection in Postcards from the Edge, her terrific semi-autobiographical novel about her drug addiction and relationship with her mother, Debbie Reynolds – was created partly as armour. She spoke often about her lifelong insecurities and in The Princess Diarist, her most recent book, in which she revealed that she and Harrison Ford had had an affair during the making of Star Wars, she writes at length about feeling like an impostor both on set and off it. And yet she was a talented actor, and it is a real shame that she didn’t make more movies. She was note-perfect in When Harry Met Sally as Marie, Meg Ryan’s neurotic single friend, and adds a necessary dash of sass to counterbalance Sally’s gentler flavour. But her persona became, perhaps deliberately, almost too well known, and whenever she appeared in a cameo – in Sex and the City, in The Big Bang Theory, even to a certain extent in the new Star Wars films – the joke was always: “Oh, there’s Carrie Fisher.” Instead, as a gifted writer, she worked increasingly behind the scenes, doing script doctoring and writing memoirs. Read any book about celebrities in New York in the 1970s and you’ll come across Fisher, ingesting more drugs than the whole of the Saturday Night Live cast put together. That Fisher ended up as sane and self-aware as she was, despite her addictions, despite her ridiculous Hollywood upbringing, is a testament to her, as she knew. An interesting comparison can be made between her and Liza Minnelli, who had similar lives. But whereas Minnelli idealises her past and her parents, Fisher preferred to look both squarely in the eye and say it as she saw it. It made living harder for her, I suspect, but a lot more fascinating for those of us gazing up at her, just listening.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Abuse and secrecy in the family courts", "content": "As a retired lawyer I read your front-page report on the abuse of women in the family courts (23 December) with sadness, frustration and anger. Toward the end of my career, the government was determined to cut the civil justice budget by steamrollering the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishing of Offenders Act 2012 through parliament. My energy and that of colleagues in other organisations went into providing detailed and considered responses to the government’s consultation. We highlighted the serious issues that would result from an increase in litigants in person, and the effect on women of the government’s proposals. We pointed out that the government had not understood the findings of research on litigants in person, and drew attention to the fact that their civil servants were keen to know more about this. We brought our concerns the justice select committee’s inquiry into Access to Justice in 2011. We were ignored and the proposals passed into law, with the devastating and predictable effects your article describes. Alan Bean (Co-chair Association of Lawyers for Children, 2009-12) Birmingham • I was horrified but not surprised to read your report concerning abuse of women in the family courts. As an approved chairman of the family courts I saw at first hand the difficulties faced by all parties in giving evidence and carrying out the necessary cross-examination required for justice to be seen and undertaken. The cross-examinations were undertaken by carefully trained and sympathetic solicitors who were able to obtain the necessary information without resorting to aggressive tactics and who gained the respect of all parties for their careful work and preparation. As family panel magistrates we were carefully trained in overseeing the process and ensuring that the intimidation of witnesses was never allowed. In this we were again supported by the solicitors who understood the procedures and all of us were prepared and had sight of the relevant paperwork well in advance. In this manner all parties were protected from aggression and invasive cross-examination. Sadly, over time, with the cuts in legal aid and procedural changes we began to see a rise in litigants in person with unrepresented parents having to conduct these extremely complicated cases without the necessary support provided in the past by solicitors. While we could, and did, protect women and sometimes men from aggression, it became increasingly difficult since magistrates are not there to take the place of the advocates available in the past but to hear the evidence and make a judgment based on the presentations by all parties. What is urgently required in the family courts is a return to the system where submissions and cross-examinations are made by carefully trained solicitors sympathetic to the parties but with a clear understanding of family law and the role of the courts. The role of the family proceedings court was never to act in an adversarial fashion but to hear and evaluate the often complex evidence in an atmosphere that enabled all parties to have the best interests of the child in mind. It is the current changes and lack of funding that has led to this situation where parties can feel free to intimidate and act in a manner that helps no one and only causes the distress highlighted so well in your article. Michael Shaw JP (Supplemental) St Albans • Magistrates have long argued for the same provisions in the family court as in the criminal courts to protect victims of domestic abuse from their perpetrators. We argued at the time of the debates concerning what is now the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act that removing most legal aid from family cases would heighten the risk of that abuse being continued in the courtroom, but our call for the extension of the requirement on the court to appoint a lawyer to conduct any examination of the victim in family proceedings was rejected. Practice Direction 12J when followed, as it always should be, is a good attempt by the judiciary to achieve the same end, but it is not as good and would not be necessary if family court users were afforded the same protection as those in the criminal court. Malcolm Richardson JP National chairman, Magistrates’ Association • Shared parenting charity Families Need Fathers welcomes suggestions by Sir James Munby, chief family judge in England and Wales, to bring further transparency to the family court (Report, 24 December). According to a survey of our service users, on average £23,000 is spent (per parent) on legal costs in family disputes. These disputes typically escalate to absurd levels, largely because they take place behind closed doors and are egged on by our adversarial legal system which cannot help but divide people into winners and losers. We believe that separated parents would behave very differently when resolving their disputes in an open court. They would be deterred from drawing out proceedings into lengthy battles with allegations and counter-allegations, and costing sums they (and the state) can ill afford. Could it not be a simple matter to reach a reasonable, responsible parenting agreement – especially if that entails the parents doing what they had been doing perfectly well for years before separation? Children suffer far more from these battles than they would if their parents’ protracted debates were shortened by several years by being exposed to public scrutiny. Our current experience is of a closed system that inadequately serves the children and families it is meant to protect. Sir James is to be praised for stripping back the cloak of excessive secrecy from the family court. We believe that, with adequate safeguards for children and vulnerable adults alike, transparency will lead to great improvements in family dispute resolution, possibly taking many cases out of court altogether. Currently the public don’t realise how ineffective the family justice system is at producing good outcomes for the difficult cases that turn to it. Nor are they aware of how the hidden and adversarial system actually escalates many family disputes instead of resolving them.

Stamp duty changes introduced two years ago had already started to have an impact at the top of the market, where the upfront cost of buying a home had increased substantially. Another change, the introduction of a higher rate of duty on second homes, was introduced in April. From the beginning of the year, the Brexit poll had triggered uncertainty in the market and the shock result ensured that the feeling will linger into 2017. Here is a round-up of the state of the British property market in 2016 and where it could be heading in 2017. House prices The official house price index, relaunched in June by the Office for National Statistics, looks at the prices paid for homes and is published a couple of months after the data is collected. The latest figures, for October, show that across the UK prices were up by 6.9% year-on-year – the lowest figure since the end of 2015. The average price was £217,000. Figures from all of the main indices show growth has slowed since the start of the year. What growth there has been is a result a shortage of homes for sale, according to the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (Rics). For several months it has reported a fall in the number of properties coming on to the market while buyer numbers have risen since the referendum. House prices Rics predicted 6% growth for the year, and the ONS figures are not far off. Simon Rubinsohn, chief economist at Rics, said 2016 had been “characterised by the stamp duty change” in April. “The stamp duty impact has been a much bigger factor in the profiles of activity over the year than the referendum.” For 2017, Rics has forecast growth will fall by half, to 3%. The UK’s largest estate agency group, Countrywide, has a gloomier outlook and has predicted a 1% fall in 2017, with Brexit-fuelled uncertainty and higher inflation fuelling the drop. Its chief economist, Fionnuala Earley, said consumers faced rising costs, particularly for essentials like food and fuel. “These sort of things will be happening slightly later than expected,” she said. “They will make it more difficult for people to afford homes and also may make some people think twice about whether it is a good time to buy.” Luxury market The top-end of the property market started the year sluggishly and carried on in the same way. Sales of homes above £1m have been dented by the changes to stamp duty brought in at the end of 2014, and uncertainty around the referendum, together with this year’s further stamp duty change, have not helped. Since the referendum, estate agents have reported interest from overseas buyers attracted by the weak pound, but some developers have reported falling sales. There have been price cuts in some of the most expensive developments, and also some reconfiguring of newbuilds so that apartments are smaller and cheaper. Property firm Savills has said prices in the prime market for central London are set to end the year down 9%, while in other upmarket parts of the capital they will be down by 5%. For 2017, Savills predicts no luxury price growth in the centre of the capital. Rubinsohn agrees: “The high end is beginning to flatline now. It may be that there are overseas buyers starting to sniff around, and maybe some domestic buyers who previously didn’t think they could afford to buy there.” Buy to let The buy-to-let market has been dominated by April’s stamp duty change. Sales boomed in the run-up to the introduction of the higher rate – figures from HM Revenue & Customs showed that in March, 162,000 properties changed hands, a rise of 77% on a year earlier. Data from the Council of Mortgage Lenders (CML) showed 29,300 mortgages were advanced to landlords that month, more than treble the number in March 2015. Lending to landlords fell after that and the numbers have run at just over half those recorded in 2015. More changes face landlords in 2017 in the form of tougher affordability checks for buy-to-let mortgages and the start of the withdrawal of tax relief on mortgage interest. The CML said it expected activity to slow as a result and that 2015 will be viewed as the high watermark for buy-to-let purchases. However Rubinsohn said it was unlikely investors would completely lose their appetite for buy to let. “You do have to bear in mind the alternatives,” he said. “Also the mentality of property investment is quite embedded despite these changes.” Buy to let Rental market Some parts of the country have seen a flood of properties into the market and the balance has tipped in favour of tenants. Countrywide has reported that in London rents are falling. In November the average rent was 0.7% lower than a year earlier, the biggest fall in six years. Savills, however, has forecast that while across the UK rents will rise by 2.5% in 2017, in London the increase will be 3%. It said this would be supported by higher earnings growth and households made up of more sharers to pay the rent. Across the UK most commentators predict rent rises of 2-3%. Housebuilding The latest government figures show that in the 12 months to the end of September the number of new homes that started construction in the UK in England was up by 4%, at 147,880. The net additions of housing, which factors in conversions and takes into account demolitions, shows that in the year 2015-16 just under 190,000 homes were added to England’s stock. This is the highest number since the financial crisis, but a House of Lords committee has called for 300,000 new homes per year in England. And there are fears that market uncertainty could mean fewer homes are started in 2017. The property firm JLL suggests the number of housing starts could fall to 134,000. Housebuilding North-south divide Growth has been driven by the south-east and east of England in 2016, but there are suggestions that some parts of the north will see higher growth – or lower falls – in the next 12 months. Rics forecasts that East Anglia will see higher growth than the UK average, but also picks the north-west and West Midlands as areas that will outperform. Of the east of England, Rubinsohn said: “Away from Cambridge much of the area is affordable and it is still commuting distance to London.” Earley said the effect of the Brexit decision could be felt most keenly in London, which is the part of the UK most vulnerable to issues in financial services sector and exports. “The might actually be a boost in areas outside London with strong export markets, perhaps the West Midlands, as long as they are not buying a lot of materials in from overseas,” she said.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Cafeteria manager jailed for insulting Turkish president, lawyer says", "content": "Turkish authorities have arrested the cafeteria manager of the opposition Cumhuriyet newspaper for insulting the president after he said he would not serve tea to Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, one of the manager’s lawyers said. Şenol Buran, who runs the canteen at the Istanbul office of Cumhuriyet, was taken into custody after police raided his home late on Saturday, Özgür Urfa said. The newspaper is among the few still critical of the government. Insulting the president is a crime punishable by up to four years in prison in Turkey. Lawyers for Erdoğan, who has dominated Turkish politics for more than a decade, have filed more than 1,800 cases against people including cartoonists, a former Miss Turkey winner and schoolchildren on accusations of insulting him. After a failed coup in July, the president said he would drop the outstanding suits in a one-off gesture of national unity. Buran has been jailed pending trial and a court date has not been announced. The justice ministry would need to approve the launch of a court case. The cafeteria manager was detained after a police officer providing security for the newspaper said he heard Buran use a derogatory term to describe Erdoğan and say he would refuse to serve the president tea if he ever visited the establishment, his lawyer said. According to court documents obtained by Reuters, Buran has denied using an insulting term, while confirming that he had said he would refuse to serve Erdoğan tea. He also said he had a dispute with the police officer two years ago. A judge at an Istanbul court on Sunday ordered Buran’s arrest pending trial, citing “strong suspicion of crime committed” and saying the suspect might otherwise put pressure on witnesses, the documents showed. Cumhuriyet has confirmed Buran was arrested. Ten staff including the newspaper’s editor in chief and senior executives were jailed in November pending trial on suspicion of crimes on behalf of Kurdish militants and the US-based cleric Fethullah Gülen, who is accused of instigating the failed coup on 15 July. The newspaper’s previous editor, Can Dündar, was jailed last year for publishing state secrets involving Turkey’s support for Syrian rebels. He was later released and is now overseas. Since the coup attempt, more than 110,000 people have been sacked or suspended and 40,000 jailed pending trial. Western allies and rights groups say they fear Erdoğan is using the attempted overthrow to crush dissent. Turkish authorities last week froze the assets of 54 journalists who have been under investigation – and some already jailed – over suspected links to what Ankara calls the “Gülenist Terror Organisation”, according to the Hürriyet newspaper. Gülen has said the charges against him are false and has condemned the attempted coup.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Laura Kuenssberg says source told her the Queen backed Brexit", "content": "The BBC’s political editor, Laura Kuenssberg, has reignited the row over whether the Queen was in favour of Brexit, saying a source told her before the referendum that the monarch made comments supportive of leaving the EU. Nine months after the Sun sparked controversy by publishing a headline, “Queen backs Brexit”, in March, Kuenssberg recalled what a contact had told her. The front page caused one of the biggest rows of the EU referendum campaign and prompted a successful complaint to the press regulator, Ipso, by Buckingham Palace, which said it was misleading. Speaking to BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, Kuenssberg revealed she had been told something similar but decided not to report it because it came from a single source. The BBC generally requires a story to be double-sourced before it can run. “In a casual chat with one of my contacts, they said, ‘Do you know what? At some point this is going to come out, and I’m telling you now and I don’t know if the BBC would touch it, but the Queen told people at a private lunch that she thinks that we should leave the EU,’” she said. “Apparently at this lunch she said: ‘I don’t see why we can’t just get out. What’s the problem?’ “My jaw hit the floor. Very sadly, I only had one source. I spent the next few days trying to prove it. I couldn’t find the evidence. Lo and behold, a couple of months later, someone else did. Of course then ensued a huge row between that newspaper and the palace over what had really been said or not said. “There were lots of moments in the referendum campaign, but for me that was one when my jaw did hit the floor. Very frustratingly, the story did eventually emerge, whether it was true or not.” The Sun stood by its story, saying it had two sources for the claim that the Queen had “let rip” at the then deputy prime minister, Nick Clegg, about Europe at a lunch at Windsor Castle. Clegg said he could not recall the conversation and dismissed the Sun’s account as “nonsense”. He went on to point the finger at Michael Gove, the former justice secretary and leave campaigner, who had also been present. Gove has never confirmed being the original source for the story, saying: “Well, as I’ve said before I don’t know how the Sun got all its information, and I don’t think it’s really worth my adding anything to what’s already been said about this story.”",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Trains halted across UK as 200 engineering projects begin", "content": "Britain’s rail network ground to a halt on Monday for the traditional Boxing Day travel disruptions, which are likely to extend into the new year in many cases. About 200 engineering projects were scheduled to start on the day after Christmas, with services on most of the country’s biggest train lines suspended and disruption on some lines lasting until early January. On Sunday night, the shadow transport secretary, Andy McDonald, accused the Conservatives of hypocrisy for being critical of the last Labour government during the regular Boxing Day rail standstills, but failing to do anything to tackle the problem now they were in power. Among the companies to have suspended services were Arriva Trains Wales, c2c, CrossCountry, East Midlands, Grand Central, Great Northern, Great Western, London Midland, Northern Rail, South West, Thameslink, TransPennine Express and Virgin. London’s Paddington station will be closed until 30 December while work on the new Crossrail line is carried out, and some services into London’s Liverpool Street station will be cancelled until 4 January. People travelling into Charing Cross and London Bridge will see a reduced service until 28 December and the Heathrow Express, transporting passengers between the airport and central London, will not run until 29 December. The line between Cardiff and Newport will be closed into the new year, and services into Manchester will be reduced until 28 December. Road users were advised to plan their routes carefully before they set off, taking into consideration the higher volume of traffic that would come with the reduced rail services. A Department for Transport spokeswoman said: “Deciding the level of service on specific days is a matter for train operators. But we know some passengers want to travel on Boxing Day, and that’s why we have worked with the rail industry to ensure there are limited services on some franchises on that day, and that the scope for Boxing Day services is considered when we are planning future franchises.” The transport difficulties came as the southern fringe of Storm Conor continued to hit parts of northern Scotland, causing heavy snow and winds of more than 80mph, as it moved past the British Isles and up towards Norway. The Met Office issued an amber “be prepared” weather warning for the Highlands and Northern Isles, which was due to expire at 6pm on Monday, with lesser yellow warnings issued for much of the rest of Scotland where winds were reaching 50mph to 60mph. Helen Roberts, a Met Office meteorologist, said Monday would see “a north-south divide” in weather conditions, with strong winds and wintry showers in Scotland, but fine weather and “crisp winter sunshine” elsewhere. While it was forecast to be a cold, frosty start to Tuesday morning – with temperatures in towns and cities around freezing, and temperatures in more rural areas a few degrees lower – the next few days were expected to be bright and dry. The “generally fine” weather was predicted to last until the end of the week.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Mervyn King: Britain better off going for hard Brexit", "content": "Britain may be better off going for a hard Brexit that would mean leaving the single market and customs union, Mervyn King, the former governor of the Bank of England, has suggested. Lord King, who has been more optimistic about leaving the EU than many economic commentators, acknowledged that Brexit would bring great political difficulties and would not be a “bed of roses”. Speaking to BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, he also said there would be many opportunities economically for the UK striking out on its own. The crossbench peer, who led the bank for a decade until 2013, said the UK should leave the European single market and warned there were “real question marks” over whether it should seek to remain in the customs union, which would limit its ability to forge trade deals on its own. Theresa May’s cabinet is split on the issue of the single market and customs union, with the most pro-Brexit ministers seeking a clean break and others warning of the economic dangers of being cut adrift from the UK’s closest trading partners. King said before the referendum that warnings of economic doom about leaving the EU were overstated. Since then, he has welcomed the fall in the pound and said he believes Britain can be better off out than in the EU. He told the BBC on Boxing Day: “I think the challenges we face mean it’s not a bed of roses – no one should pretend that – but equally it is not the end of the world and there are some real opportunities that arise from the fact of Brexit we might take. “There are many opportunities and I think we should look at it in a much more self-confident way than either side is approaching it at present. Being out of what is a pretty unsuccessful European Union – particularly in the economic sense – gives us opportunities as well as obviously great political difficulties.” King said it made no sense for the UK to seek to join Norway as a non-EU member of the single market, which would allow free access for businesses but probably mean accepting freedom of movement of EU citizens. He also raised doubts over the merits of remaining within the customs union, which would allow Britain to trade goods without border tariffs, like Turkey, but restrict its ability to strike its own trade deals. Facebook Twitter Pinterest People taking part in a March for Europe rally in London. Photograph: Daniel Leal-Olivas/PA A Turkey-style arrangement would make it more difficult to take advantage of those opportunities, said King. “I don’t think it makes sense for us to pretend we should remain in the single market and I think there are real question marks about whether it makes sense to remain in the customs union. Clearly, if we do that we cannot make our own trade deals with other countries.” He said the government should outline its policies on immigration sooner rather than later, arguing that it would be a mistake to make them part of the withdrawal negotiations that will be triggered when the prime minister invokes article 50 next year. King’s comments were immediately welcomed by Nigel Farage, who said they were “wise words” that Britain could thrive outside the single market. However, a former member of the Bank’s monetary policy committee said Lord King’s intervention was “political” and should be ignored. Prof David Blanchflower told LBC radio: “I don’t think Mervyn King is a credible source on this. “If you look back, there are three huge mistakes he made. First, he was the governor of the Bank of England who never spotted that Northern Rock was going to fail. He was in charge when the biggest recession in 300 years came. Then RBS failed in September 2008 and he had no idea that was happening. “In 2010, he advised the government that austerity ought to be really good for growth, and that turned out to be a disaster. I don’t think he is a credible source on any of that and we shouldn’t believe in what he says in terms of his forecasts.” King’s assessment of Brexit came as it was reported that Wilbur Ross, the billionaire businessman chosen by the US president-elect Donald Trump as his new trade chief, had said earlier this year that Brexit represented a “God-given opportunity” for other countries to take business away from the UK. The US commerce secretary-designate said Britain was facing a “period of confusion” following the vote to leave the EU and that it was inevitable there would be relocations, according to the Times. Ross will be responsible for negotiating a free trade deal with the UK and his reported comments will raise concerns the incoming US administration will seek to exploit Britain’s isolation following Brexit. His remarks were said to have been made to an audience of Cypriot financiers in the days following last June’s referendum vote – before he had been appointed to Trump’s cabinet. “I recommend that Cyprus should adopt and immediately announce even more liberal financial service policies than it already has so that it can try to take advantage of the inevitable relocations that will occur during the period of confusion,” he is quoted as saying. Ross is said to have added that the UK’s withdrawal from the EU was a “God-given opportunity” for financial rivals of the City of London, naming Frankfurt and Dublin in particular. Labour said his comments should be a “salutary warning” that other countries were ready to take advantage of the UK’s vulnerability post-Brexit. But a UK government spokesman sought to play down the reported comments, saying: “We will build a relationship with the new administration based on substance not rumour.” Blanchflower said Ross’s comments “don’t augur well for the future”, when the UK will need to find new trade deals outside the EU. He told LBC: “There is great uncertainty coming. Firms have no idea what is coming, and in that circumstance, they are going to hold back on investment and hiring ... We have no idea what is coming. It is a considerable worry. My expectation is - and virtually every economist now thinks - that the economy is going to slow pretty fast as the uncertainty rises.”",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Dickens used wild weather to great effect in his Christmas books", "content": "You should have seen him, writes Charles Dickens, of his eponymous hero The Haunted Man (1848), the fifth of his Christmas books. “You should have seen him in his dwelling, about twilight, in the dead winter time. When the wind was blowing shrill and shrewd, with the going down of the blurred sun. When it was just so dark, as that the form of things were indistinct and big – but not wholly lost. When sitters by the fire began to see the wild faces and figures, mountains and abysses, ambuscades and armies, in the coals. When people in the streets bent down their heads and ran before the weather.” Dickens introduced A Christmas Carol with a hymn to the frost, and The Chimes with an incantation to the winter rain. By the time he started his last Yuletide novella, he had gone into narrative autopilot and at least two dozen consecutive descriptive sentences begin with the same word. “When those who were obliged to meet it were stopped at angry corners, stung by wandering snowflakes alighting on the lashes of their eyes – which fell too sparingly and were blown away too quickly, to leave a trace upon the frozen ground.” On and on he goes, evoking travellers by land, and the moment “when mariners at sea, outlying on icy yards were tossed and swung above the howling ocean dreadfully.” He turns hostile climate into literary atmosphere and makes heavy weather of it, for more than two pages of the Chapman & Hall Fireside Edition, to open a story that shamefully many of us have never finished.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Care funding crisis needs national debate", "content": "Government proposals to deal with the care funding crisis in the local government finance settlement by allowing a small increase in council tax will not be nearly enough to plug the gap, and we are very clear that full reform of funding is needed (Council tax rise ‘not enough to fill funding gap in social care’, 16 December). The 2% increase in council tax this year brought in about £360m nationally, and still leaves a predicted gap of £2.2bn by 2020. This would suggest that council tax would need to increase by about 14% to deal with this problem, ignoring any other inflationary problems faced by any provider of services. If council tax was a fair tax then this might be acceptable, but council tax is an inherently unfair tax. People who own a small terrace house in Liverpool already pay as much as the owner of a mansion flat in Westminster because of the way that the system works. Poor people pay a much higher proportion of their income in council tax than rich people. In some parts of the country the needs of the extremely poor will be paid by the relatively poor if council tax is the only route for dealing with this problem. This is why the Liberal Democrats support a root and branch review of the entire funding programme for health and social care. We need a national debate about these issues if we are to stop such panicked measures like the one the government took in the finance settlement.

Of the full list of 30, 21 were shown on the BBC. Police dramas Line of Duty on BBC2 and Happy Valley on BBC1 occupied the second and third slots, with BBC3’s Fleabag the only comedy in the top 10, at number four. Planet Earth II, which racked up the largest audiences for a natural history programme in at least 15 years, was ranked at number eight. The only programmes not shown on the corporation’s channels to make the top 10 were Netflix royal drama The Crown, which came in at number seven, and Channel 4’s National Treasure, starring Robbie Coltrane and Andrea Riseborough. Netflix’s Stranger Things, which became a water-cooler hit this summer, just missed out on the top 10, but beat the BBC’s second series of Poldark at number 12 and Sky’s only entry, Westworld, at number 13.

Fake news: an insidious trend that's fast becoming a global problem Read more The exchange of tense public words between two countries with a difficult relationship and no diplomatic ties comes the same month that a fake news story about a child abuse ring prompted a gunman to fire shots inside a pizza restaurant in Washington. The spat appeared to have been prompted by the publication of a fake story headlined “Israeli Defense Minister: If Pakistan send ground troops to Syria on any pretext, we will destroy this country with a nuclear attack”. The story appeared on 20 December on the site AWD News, which has been identified by fact-checking organisations as a fake news site. Snopes, one of five organisations chosen by Facebook to vet questionable stores, said AWD News “doesn’t have more than a nodding acquaintance with facts, instead playing on nationalistic fantasy and conspiracy theory to create alarming … stories.” Facebook Twitter Pinterest The original article mis-identified Israeli minister Moshe Ya’alon. Photograph: Jim Hollander/AP The article mis-identified Moshe Ya’alon as the Israeli defence minister when he actually resigned in May, changed the title of a senior official from the Pakistan government and was dotted with grammatical errors and strange syntax. Undeterred by those warning signs, Pakistan’s defence minister, Khawaja Mohammad Asif, apparently read the article as a genuine threat of a pre-emptive nuclear strike and took to Twitter to warn Israel that “Pakistan is a nuclear state too.” Khawaja M. Asif (@KhawajaMAsif) Israeli def min threatens nuclear retaliation presuming pak role in Syria against Daesh.Israel forgets Pakistan is a Nuclear state too AH December 23, 2016 Israel’s defense ministry responded the next day, also on Twitter, saying the original story was “totally fictitious” and the quote had been invented. Ministry of Defense (@Israel_MOD) @KhawajaMAsif reports referred to by the Pakistani Def Min are entirely false December 24, 2016 After the Twitter spat pushed the story into the spotlight, AWD updated it to identify Ya’alon as a former defence minister in the body of the text, but left the headline unchanged. It continued to mis-identify Tariq Fatemi, special assistant to the Pakistani prime minister, as minister of state for foreign affairs. There was no immediate reaction from Pakistan to Israel’s response, but Asif did take time to direct an oblique message at the New York Times. After the paper described his own tweet as a “nuclear threat”, Asif insisted that Pakistan’s nuclear programme “is only a deterrence”. Khawaja M.

Their dispute is the latest case of fake news, peddled by sites with political aims or simply to earn money from advertising, influencing the real world. Concern about real world spillover spiked in early December after a man opened fire in a pizza restaurant in Washington DC after becoming convinced by fake news reports that it was used for child sex abuse. He claimed he had come to investigate “Pizzagate”, a baseless conspiracy, which falsely claims Clinton and her campaign chief John Podesta were running a child sex ring from the restaurant’s backrooms. Tech companies have come under increasing pressure to roll out changes to attempt to thwart the trend, which has become a global problem.

But beyond the investment headlines, we also need to see evidence of a joined-up approach to finding a long-term solution to providing universal superfast broadband, which, as well as improving 4G and 5G, will mean converging fibre broadband and local wireless infrastructure, rather than still relying in many areas on the old copper systems we have today.

{ "title":"The Guardian view on the colonial past: a German lesson for Britain", "content": "The colonial history of modern Germany was relatively short. Germany itself only came into existence in 1871. Less than half a century later, in 1919, its colonial possessions were stripped from it. By comparison with Britain, France, the Netherlands, Spain and others, Germany’s empire left a relatively small imprint on the history of the globe. Yet Germany’s colonial history was violent and bloody. It claimed possessions in west, east and southern Africa, as well as the south-west Pacific. These involved sustained plunder and racially driven violence against native peoples. When the Herero and Nama peoples of modern Namibia rebelled against German rule in 1904, for example, they were butchered, forced off their lands, their wells poisoned and the survivors imprisoned in concentration camps where they were often worked to death in squalid conditions. Why this focus on Germany, readers may be asking? After all, other European colonial powers pursued similar policies over longer periods across more of the globe. The answer is that, unlike them, modern Germany has made a serious institutional effort to debate its colonial past and engage with former colonies on issues including reparations and formal apology. Delicate negotiations between Germany and Namibia about the events of 1904 are set to be completed by June. Meanwhile in Berlin, the German History Museum is currently hosting a special exhibition on Germany’s colonial past. It is impossible to imagine either thing happening in Britain. As the Cecil Rhodes row a year ago showed, British educational and cultural life struggle to deal with a colonial past whose scale, duration and impact far exceeded that of imperial Germany. The British empire is rarely taught in schools. A museum on the subject in Bristol collapsed amid acrimony in 2012. Public debate rarely gets beyond the clash of jingoism and guilt. Occasional calls for reparations and acts of contrition are met with short shrift, and dismissed as legally invalid. Meanwhile, although Britain has other museums, from the British Museum downwards, with a range of imaginative historical programmes, there is no official museum of British history of the kind that Germany now supports in the heart of Berlin, let alone a national museum dedicated principally to the imperial past. It is worth reflecting on why an official exhibition in London about British colonialism, similar to the kind that is now running in Berlin about the German equivalent, is so inconceivable. It’s because it is too difficult and painful. Such an event would not be an act of collective national reflection, because that seems beyond us. The passions of supporters and opponents alike would make any kind of consensus approach difficult. It would be a partisan political act. The Daily Mail and Michael Gove would dismiss it as political correctness gone mad. This predictability is a reminder of three things. The first is that, whether we acknowledge it or not, the colonial past is still with us in Britain today. The second is that Britain has a lazy tradition of taking a rosy view of its own history, in which national crimes play little or no part and from which there is no lesson except British greatness. The third is that modern Britain lacks not just a shared view of history, but a common culture generally, as the clumsy arguments about British values always expose. Because of its past, modern Germany does not have these luxuries of self-deception and self-glorification. Germany has no alternative but to balance pride about some aspects of its inheritance with the imperative of facing up to others. Until recently, Germany has been so preoccupied with its Nazi past that the colonial era has been ignored. Yet some historians argue that the racial theories and treatment of native peoples connect directly with the mentalities and horrors of the Nazis. These things are never neat and tidy. The US has one of the most self-glorifying cultures on the planet. But the US also has a better record of publicly debating important aspects of its own history than Britain. Even in the Trump era, Washington DC has outstanding and popular museums on Native American and African American history for which Britain has no equivalent. Yet Britain needs somehow to learn from what these German and American museums are doing. Over Christmas Theresa May called on Britain to come together after Brexit.That’s a tall order, but part of it would mean seeing ourselves as others see us. Another would involve telling and facing complex and difficult truths about the national past. Right now, we are very bad at both of these things.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Russia plane crash: terrorism not thought to be cause, say authorities", "content": "Russian authorities say they do not believe a terrorist attack was responsible for the crash of a Syria-bound military plane with 92 people on board. However, the cause of the crash is still unclear: the main possibilities under consideration are pilot error, technical malfunction, poor quality fuel or an unidentified object lodging in the engines. Early on Tuesday, the Russian defence ministry confirmed it had found a flight recorder from the Tu-154 jet. The aircraft, which was carrying more than 60 members of the internationally renowned Red Army choir to entertain Russian troops in Syria for the new year, went down off the resort city of Sochi shortly after takeoff early on Sunday morning. From the start, there was little hope that any passengers had survived the crash. More than 3,000 rescue workers laboured through the night, racing to find the remaining bodies and debris before the currents carry them further away from shore. The first 10 bodies have been flown to Moscow amid a national outpouring of grief. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Vladimir Putin orders investigation into plane crash The FSB security services said on Monday that terrorism was not deemed a likely cause, as did the transport minister, Maksim Sokolov, in a televised briefing. “Currently, the main versions do not include an act of terror,” he said. “There could be various causes – they are being analysed by specialists, experts, the investigative committee.” Vladimir Putin orders probe into military plane crash with 92 lost Read more The search operation included 39 vessels covering more than 100 sq km (38 sq miles), with planes, helicopters and drones searching from above and deep-water equipment and divers hunting below the surface. “I think we will be able to find the location of the plane on the bottom of the Black Sea today,” Viktor Bondarev, the commander of the Russian air force, told Russian agencies. “When we find the plane, we will raise the flight recorders to the surface. We know they are located in the tail and I am sure that the tail was damaged the least,” he said. On Monday, evening, agencies reported that parts of the fuselage had been found and lifted from the seabed, but the black boxes had not yet been found.

Photograph: Yekaterina Lyzlova/AFP/Getty Images Sokolov said some of the bodies could have already been carried off by the current to Abkhazia, the separatist region of Georgia. Search operations were under way there too. By Monday evening, 13 bodies had been found, as well as more than 150 body fragments. “The search is complicated by the large depth range and the sea bottom relief characteristics in the presumed crash area,” Igor Konashenkov, a defence ministry spokesman, said in a briefing. Along with the first 10 bodies, 86 body parts were flown to the capital for DNA analysis, he added. The passenger jet went down at 5:25am local time (0225 GMT) on Sunday, minutes after taking off from Sochi’s airport where it had stopped to refuel after flying out from the Chkalovsky military aerodrome in the Moscow region. On board were 64 members of the Alexandrov Ensemble – the army’s official musical group, also known as the Red Army Choir – and their conductor, Valery Khalilov. “The ensemble has been orphaned by a third,” said the state channel Rossiya. The choir was due to perform for Russian troops deployed in Syria during new year’s celebrations at the Hmeimim airbase, which has been used to launch airstrikes in support of Moscow’s ally, President Bashar al-Assad. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Russian rescuer boats patrol off the coast of Sochi looking for debris. Photograph: Yekaterina Shtukina/AFP/Getty Images Other passengers included military officers, journalists and Yelizaveta Glinka, a popular charity worker also known as Doctor Liza who had been flying with medical supplies for a hospital in the coastal city of Latakia. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, ordered a day of national mourning on Monday, with state television flashing black and white pictures of the victims across the screen while entertainment programmes were cancelled. There has been little public discussion of Russia’s war in Syria, except for a simple narrative about fighting terrorism. In a carefully phrased editorial on Monday, the daily newspaper Vedomosti said the plane crash was a tragedy, but the dead were “victims of a war which we are taking part in, whether freely or not”. “We understand the depth of this tragedy, but we do not think it should limit public discussion of whether Russia should be taking part in this war,” it said. People brought flowers to improvised memorials at the port in central Sochi and the city’s airport, as well as to the Moscow headquarters of the Red Army Choir and the office of Fair Aid, the non-governmental organisation that Glinka headed, which primarily worked with the homeless. Tu-154 aircraft have been involved in a number of accidents and are no longer used by commercial airlines in Russia. But Sergei Bainetov, the air force head of flight safety, said on Sunday that the plane involved in the crash was “in good condition technically”. In April 2010 many high-ranking Polish officials, including the then president Lech Kaczynski, were killed when a Tu-154 airliner went down in thick fog while approaching Smolensk airport in western Russia.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"UK factories wary of sterling's fall and rising costs in new year", "content": "Britain’s manufacturers are bracing for more swings in the exchange rate and rising costs, as the start of Brexit negotiations in 2017 threatens to keep the pound under pressure. Factories have had to cope with sharp rises in energy and raw material costs in recent months as the weak pound makes imports to the UK more expensive. For manufacturers that export there has been a small silver lining as the fall in the pound since the Brexit vote has made their goods cheaper to overseas buyers, but that boost has only partially offset the pressure from higher costs. The British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) says that six months on from the EU referendum, its members in the manufacturing industry have become more worried about moves in the pound and about inflation. Its poll of 1,775 manufacturers showed 56% felt that the exchange rate was more of a concern to their business than three months ago, up from 48% in September. There was also an increase in the proportion worried about rising prices, reflecting official figures for November that showed manufacturers faced the sharpest rise in their costs for five years. The BCC survey found 26% of manufacturers now saw inflation as more of a concern, up from 21% three months ago. Suren Thiru, the BCC’s head of economics, highlighted the pressures on manufacturers from the pound’s drop since the referendum which has seen it lose its value 17% against the dollar and 10% against the euro. “While the post-referendum slump in the value of sterling is benefiting some exporters, a weak currency is something of a double-edged sword, as many UK exporters also import goods and raw materials, so will be facing higher input costs,” he said. The business group wants more help for firms to offset the pressures from the Brexit process, which has already shown signs of slowing business investment and knocking consumer confidence. Thiru highlighted business rates, a tax that firms pay on their commercial property, as one cost that could be lowered by the government. “Uncertainty over future currency movements is also a growing concern for businesses. With further expected rises in the US interest rate in the coming months likely to place further downward pressure on sterling, it is vital that more is done to address the high input costs faced by businesses, particularly business rates.” The economic news since the vote to leave the EU in June has generally defied gloomy predictions of a sharp slowdown from forecasters like the Bank of England and International Monetary Fund. But the most recent indicators suggest the Brexit vote is starting to be felt and that the effects will become more pronounced in 2017 when negotiations over the leaving the EU being in earnest. The latest official figures on inflation suggest the weak pound is now feeding through to prices paid by consumers, particularly for fuel. Inflation hit a two-year high of 1.2% last month and forecasters expect it to continue rising and approach 3% in 2017. The jobs market has also shown signs of strain. The pace of hiring has eased off and there has been a jump in the number of people considered “economically inactive” – out of work and not looking for work. Consumer confidence polls have pointed to growing worries about the economic outlook and about inflation in particular. Thinktanks have warned higher prices and a slowdown in wage growth will squeeze household incomes. There have also been indications that business investment is slowing but a separate poll from the Institute of Directors (IoD) suggested firms were still willing to spend and expand in 2017. Its survey of 844 business leaders suggested they were cautiously upbeat about the year ahead. More than 60% were optimistic or very optimistic about their prospects in 2017, and the net optimism against pessimism figure, at 50%, was the highest since the vote to leave the EU in June. But business bosses also warned of a number of concerns that could see their expectations prove over-optimistic. Half felt current UK economic conditions were having a negative effect on their business’ growth, and 45% felt an uncertain trading status with the EU was holding them back. There were also worries about skills shortages amid the prospect of an immigration clampdown after Brexit.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"The New Year’s Eve party when a bad fairy turned into a good friend", "content": "Everyone I know is tense about New Year’s Eve. The superstition is that if the evening itself is appalling, that’s how the next year is going to be. We need to be in the company of people we love, or at least like, and with strangers who might become friends. With this in mind, some years ago I decided to host a party. On the morning of the big night, I woke up to find that the left side of my face had swollen up. My cheek looked like a red leather boxing glove. An emergency dentist gave me some antibiotics and murmured the words “root canal treatment”, which he said I could look forward to in the new year. Her smile was sultry and spiteful at the same time. I could see that it really turned him on, but then he screamed and dropped the samosas on the floor. Two friends arrived in the afternoon to help me prepare. One of them made samosas and the other brewed a big pot of soup that she insisted was related to vichyssoise. It looked like grey, slimy gruel. My wish to host a party in the style of The Great Gatsby, in which “men and girls came and went like moths among the whisperings and the champagne and the stars”, was fading. Guests began to arrive. The atmosphere was friendly. Everywhere I looked were men and women engaged in lively conversation. Some of them were even dancing while corks popped and glasses smashed. Then, as we moved closer to midnight, a bad fairy came to the ball. She was a friend of a friend and everyone was a little scared of her. I would call her Henrietta, but she was mostly known as Henry. It was well known that Henry was very hostile to all women, for reasons best known to herself. She had icy-blonde hair and was wearing a white halterneck dress. Henry sidled up to me. Six-foot tall in her heels, she lifted a finger and prodded my swollen cheek. “Shame it’s not Halloween,” she said. Henry began to say things that were undermining and mean in a vague sort of way, in a little girl’s voice. Her real voice was quite deep and authoritative. I told myself it was just her ironic humour. She waved to her boyfriend who had offered to pass around a plate of samosas. He was Swedish and I knew he was anxious about taking Henry to his wooden house on the archipelago. He had rented it out for the winter but had texted the tenants to see if they would leave a week early. His smartphone kept buzzing in the pocket of his jacket – presumably his furious tenants. Meanwhile, penniless poets were opening the champagne bottles I was saving for midnight and the alcoholic who came to every party had fallen over. Henry’s boyfriend told me he was translating a book from Swedish into English. “Will you work on the translation in your wooden house on the archipelago?” I asked. “Well,” he was sweating, “it looks like the tenants are refusing to leave early.” Henry had now taken off her shoes and was walking barefoot towards him. Her smile was sultry and spiteful at the same time. I could see it really turned him on, but then he screamed and dropped the samosas on the floor.  A plume of smoke was billowing out of his jacket pocket. It took a while to work out what as going on, but it became clear his phone had caught fire. Everyone started to pull off his jacket. My best friend ran with it into the garden and threw it on the grass. There was a debate about what to do next. Someone said to pour water over it. A guest advised we use baking soda instead. I found some and we sprinkled it over the smouldering phone. It was a minute to midnight so we left it and ran inside to sing Auld Lang Syne. Henry held hands with her boyfriend who now was stripped of his jacket and singed shirt, but OK. He looked like an American marine in his white vest. We kissed and hugged each other (avoiding Henry) and drank to the new year. Later on, I walked up to my bedroom. I was in agony. Root canal treatment. Another year had begun. There was a knock on the door and in walked Henry carrying my cat in her arms. She said she was concerned about it playing near the stupid smartphone in the garden. She sat on the bed and we talked for a long time. We became friends. She died a few years ago and I miss her, but it would be true to say that she was the inspiration for the sort of complicated woman, not particularly likeable at first but with many fronts to disguise her own sadness (a bit like Jay Gatsby), who lives on in some of my fiction.",diasaster:0},

{ "title":"Barack Obama: I'm 'confident' I could have won a third term as president", "content": "Barack Obama has said he believes he would have won a third term in office were he eligible to run in the 2016 presidential election, while also casting a skeptical eye at the UK Labour party under Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership. In a wide-ranging interview with former aide David Axelrod, the outgoing president expressed his belief that he could have won re-election in 2016, based on his view that most Americans still subscribed to his progressive vision and ideals. “I am confident in this vision because I’m confident that if I had run again and articulated it, I think I could’ve mobilized a majority of the American people to rally behind it,” Obama said on Axelrod’s CNN podcast. The outgoing president summarized this progressive American spirit as one that “manifests itself in communities all across the country”. “We see it in this younger generation that is smarter, more tolerant, more innovative, more creative, more entrepreneurial, would not even think about, you know, discriminating against somebody for example because of their sexual orientation.” Ultimately, Obama did not think the election represented a sea change in American politics or a repudiation of his administration, insisting that “the culture actually did shift, that the majority does buy into the notion of one America that is tolerant and diverse and open and full of energy and dynamism”. To an extent, this was reflected in the final outcome of the election, where Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by nearly 3m votes. Despite Clinton’s popular plurality, however, she lost several industrial states in the Rust Belt by narrow margins. She lost Pennsylvania by 44,000 votes, Wisconsin by 23,000 votes and Michigan by 10,000 votes. Had she won all three states, Clinton would have bested Trump in the electoral college and won the White House. Obama might very well have fared better in the 2016 election. Clinton was unable to turn out as many African American voters as Obama had in the previous two general elections. Her support among blue-collar white voters also collapsed. This was particularly notable in Wisconsin, a state where Obama won white non-college-educated voters in both 2008 and 2012. Clinton was unable to compensate for these demographic losses with sufficient gains among Hispanic, white and college-educated voters. Trump responded to Obama’s comments on Twitter late on Monday afternoon. “President Obama said that he thinks he would have won against me. He should say that but I say NO WAY! - jobs leaving, ISIS, OCare, etc”, the president-elect wrote. Obama currently has a favorable rating of 55% according to an average of polls compiled by HuffPost Pollster, while Trump is at 43%. However, the outgoing president insisted that he didn’t fear what Axelrod called “a Corbynization” of the Democratic party following this bruising loss in the November election, “partly because I think that the Democratic party has stayed pretty grounded in fact and reality”. Obama indirectly compared the state of the Labour party under Jeremy Corbyn to that of the Republican party in the US, which he said had “started filling up with all kinds of conspiracy theorizing”. The president contrasted this with the Republican party, which he characterized as “mov[ing] further and further and further away from what we would consider to be a basic consensus around things like climate change or how the economy works”. The result, Obama said, was that “it started filling up with all kinds of conspiracy theorizing that became kind of common wisdom or conventional wisdom within the Republican party base. That hasn’t happened in the Democratic party. I think people like the passion that Bernie brought, but Bernie Sanders is a pretty centrist politician relative to ... Corbyn or relative to some of the Republicans”. A spokesman for Corbyn said: “Both Labour and US Democrats will have to challenge power if they are going to speak for working people and change a broken system that isn’t delivering for the majority. What Jeremy Corbyn stands for is what most people want: to take on the tax cheats, create a fairer economy, fund a fully public NHS, build more homes, and stop backing illegal wars. “For the establishment, those ideas are dangerous. For most people in Britain, they’re common sense and grounded in reality.” Obama is barred from running for a third term under a provision of the US constitution. Since the ratification of the 22nd amendment in 1951, presidents have been unable to serve more than two terms in office. Although there had previously been no limit on how many terms one could serve in the presidency, the two terms served by George Washington had served as an unbinding precedent on his successors. However, this precedent was broken by Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s decision to run for a third term in 1940. After Roosevelt won that election as well as the succeeding one in 1944, hostility from Republicans towards his actions led to the 22nd amendment’s passage.",diasaster:0},

{ "title":"George Michael was a defiant gay icon. His life must not be sanitised", "content": "More than 18 years ago, George Michael was famously outed for a “lewd act” in a Beverly Hills toilet – and promptly humiliated by institutionally homophobic newspapers. Some might have been consumed with shame and grovelled before a tabloid press that had assumed the position of hypocritical moralisers once occupied by the medieval church. Instead, Michael penned the biggest “fuck you” in musical history: Outside, a song that unapologetically flaunted his human sexual appetite, and declared war on the hypocrisy of others. Sex was natural, the song said; it was the attitudes to it that were not: “There’s nothing here but flesh and bone.” No sanitising or erasing who Michael was. He was a gay man, a gay icon, and being gay was central to his identity and his music. Like many gay men, coming to terms with his sexuality was a fraught process: he thought he loved women and only accepted he was gay in his mid-20s, still years before he told his parents. Some are saying: why wait until he was 35 to come out, and only under duress? Coming out wildly differs from person to person: it is an experience imposed upon gay men – and all LGBT people – by a society still far from entirely accepting us. For a superstar back in the 1990s, it was considerably harder than it was today. According to the British Social Attitudes survey, in the year Michael came out half of all Britons thought same-sex relations were always or mostly wrong (nearly four in 10 said “always”), while only 23% opted for “not wrong at all”. From section 28 (only a decade old) to a different age of consent, the anti-gay laws were still in place. Pop superstar George Michael dies aged 53 Read more Coming out should not be some sort of duty for public figures: it is a highly personal experience, and life is complicated. But, undoubtedly, Michael coming out offered a liferaft to so many LGBT people – not just gay men – struggling in a society that judged them and made them internalise shame. It is difficult to describe how lonely this experience is. But here was a household name: the girls at school – and their mums – fancied him. Yes, it’s true that the manner in which he was outed became a standard playground homophobic trope, a means for bigots to express their revulsion at how sordid and morally corrupt they deemed gay men to be. But haters gonna hate, as the expression goes – homophobes will latch on to anything to confirm their bigoted narrative. For LGBT people consumed with terror at the realisation of who they were, to see the man who sang Last Christmas telling his tormentors where to stick it was liberating. In the 1980s and much of the 1990s, gay men were dying in their thousands from HIV/AIDS. Much of society alternated between pity, disgust and a sense of “they’ve brought it on themselves” as they perished. Michael was among those who watched his lover, Anselmo Feleppa, tortured and killed by the illness. His No 1 1996 hit, Jesus to a Child, was about this terrible loss, underlining how his sexuality and his music cannot, and must not, be divorced. Being gay and out is one thing, but often it is on the terms of a disapproving society. As long as you are sanitised and, preferably, sexless in appearance, you can gain acceptance – or so the unspoken pact goes. While once bigots persecuted gays, as Matthew Parris noted, now “they haven’t stopped hating, and their new cry is this: ‘Why don’t you just shut up about it? Who asked what you get up to in bed, anyway? Your private life is your affair but please stop ramming it down our throat [snigger, snigger]’ …” Michael rejected the unspoken pact. He had an open relationship. He loved anonymous sex. “You only have to turn on the television to see the whole of British society being comforted by gay men who are so clearly gay and so obviously sexually unthreatening,” he told the Guardian’s Simon Hattenstone in 2005. “Gay people in the media are doing what makes straight people comfortable, and automatically my response to that is to say I’m a dirty filthy fucker and if you can’t deal with it, you can’t deal with it.” Or as he put it rather enthusiastically on Twitter: “I have never and will never apologise for my sex life! Gay sex is natural, gay sex is good! Not everybody does it, but … ha ha!” Facebook Twitter Pinterest Singer, songwriter, pop superstar: George Michael dies aged 53 Here was a man who proudly campaigned for LGBT rights, becoming a high-profile supporter of HIV charity the Terrence Higgins Trust. He was profoundly political in many other ways, too, backing Labour through the trauma of Thatcherism and backing Britain’s striking miners. He put on a free concert for NHS nurses to say thank you for looking after his dying mum. In 2003, he reworked Faith alongside Ms Dynamite into an anti-Iraq war track, and even released a single – Shoot the Dog – that castigated Tony Blair’s alliance with George W Bush and the neocons. I can already here the cries: “Stop politicising him!” It is the cry of people who want to erase the aspects of those they admire that contradict their own worldview. But when people die, we have a responsibility to remember who they actually were, not a sanitised and false version that is palatable to some. We live in an age where bigots are newly emboldened. They treat supporters of anti-racism, feminism and LGBT rights like this: “You’ve had your party, now it’s over, and it’s our turn.” It is tempting to turn and retreat.

{ "title":"'It's just who I am': George Michael's long career and turbulent life", "content": "George Michael had not been ill immediately before his death, his publicist said on Sunday night, which made his sudden, abrupt passing from a heart attack all the more shocking. But in a long career and at times turbulent private life, the singer had already survived more than one brush with death, as well as enduring depression, bereavement, paralysing grief, legal battles with his record company, public embarrassment, several encounters with police and a long and unhappy period where he felt unable to acknowledge his homosexuality. A life in pictures - George Michael Read more Michael very nearly died in 2011, after he fell ill from severe pneumonia during his Symphonica tour and spent a week in intensive care in Vienna. Two days before Christmas that year, shortly after being released from hospital, he made an emotional speech outside his home in London paying tribute to the staff at Vienna general hospital whom he said had saved his life. It had been, he said, “by far the worst month of my life”. Asked what had kept him going, he said: “The fact that I have been so lucky and the fact that I have plenty to live for. I have an amazing, amazing life.” Facebook Twitter Pinterest George Michael: singer, songwriter, pop superstar, dies aged 53 Eighteen months later, in May 2013, he was airlifted to hospital with a head injury following a bizarre incident on the M1, when he fell from his car on to the road. He spent several days in hospital the following year, after concerned friends dialled 999 when he fell ill at home. For 12 years from 1991, Michael said in 2005, he was trapped in “depression and fear and lots of other shit. I swear to God it was like I had a curse on me”. His long-term boyfriend, Anselmo Feleppa, died from an Aids-related illness in 1993 without the singer able to publicly acknowledge their relationship. His mother died shortly afterwards, followed by a beloved new puppy. “I had an overwhelming feeling that the best was behind me,” he said later, turning to Prozac and marijuana. At one point he was smoking 25 joints a day. Since 1992 he had been embroiled in a bitter dispute with his record company, Sony, after he claimed the label had failed to sufficiently promote his second solo album, Listen Without Prejudice Vol 1. Two years later he lost the case. Michael’s arrest in 1998 for performing a “lewd act” in a Beverly Hills toilet was the first of several high-profile encounters with the police. But while the episode could have ended other careers in disgrace, the singer was unapologetic, acknowledging his sexuality for the first time and turning the incident into the defiant gay anthem Outside. Back in the UK, he was arrested several times for drug offences, including a conviction for driving when unfit through drugs when he was found collapsed in his Mercedes in 2006. In 2010, he was given a five-year driving ban and sentenced to eight weeks in prison after crashing his Range Rover into a branch of Snappy Snaps in Hampstead, north London. Michael’s barrister told the court the singer was “deeply ashamed” of the incident, and that he had checked himself into rehab immediately afterwards. “His creativity, so long hampered by his drug dependence, is re-emerging,” the lawyer said. Michael said he had had his first relationship at 27, and having lived unhappily in the closet for so long, the singer defended his lifestyle, which included frequent cruising for sex on Hampstead Heath while living with his partner Kenny Goss (the pair split in 2009). Some people wanted to view him as a tragic figure “with all the cottaging and drug-taking”, he told the Guardian in 2009, because “those things are not what most people aspire to, and I think it removes people’s envy to see your weaknesses”. To Michael, however, those were not weaknesses. “It’s just who I am,” he said.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"China to rein in outward investment as domestic growth stalls", "content": "Beijing has signalled plans to curb Chinese firms’ investment in foreign assets, after revealing that companies from China are on course to spend 1.12 trillion yuan (£130bn) on everything from British football clubs to a Hollywood film producer in 2016. Companies from China ramped up their spending on overseas assets during the year, as a weakening domestic economy saw investors turn their attention overseas. A diverse array of targets included the maker of Godzilla, Aston Villa Football Club and the pub in which former prime minister David Cameron and Chinese premier Xi Jinping once shared a pint. The spending spree boosted non-financial overseas investment 55% in the first 11 months of 2016, putting Chinese companies on course to spend £130bn this year, compared with £86bn in 2015, said commerce minister Gao Hucheng. Oscar's £52m move to Shanghai is worrying for Chelsea FC – and China Read more While foreign investment has soared, the amount of money flowing into the country is set to remain broadly flat at £92bn. This means the difference between investments abroad and those coming into China has reached an unprecedented £39bn. The widening gap has triggered concerns about capital flight, where investors send their money out of the country rather than investing it to spur domestic growth. Gao signalled that Beijing would move to address the investment gap by reining in Chinese firms’ overseas spending and making it easier for firms from abroad to access the Chinese economy. He said the government would “promote the healthy and orderly development of outbound investment and cooperation in 2017”, in remarks at a conference that were published on the commerce ministry’s website. In November it was reported that China was preparing a clampdown on non-Chinese mergers and acquisitions. Separately, the ministry said on its blog that China would sharply reduce restrictions on foreign investment access in 2017 to make it easier for overseas firms to spend their cash in the People’s Republic. No details were given on what restrictions would be changed. Major Chinese investors have spread their investment around the world and across multiple sectors during 2016. One of the most high-profile purchases was part of a multi-billion dollar bet on high-end US real estate by Chinese buyers. Insurer Anbang spent $6.5bn (£5.3bn) on luxury group Strategic Hotels & Resorts from private equity group Blackstone, continuing a flood of Chinese money into prime US property. The deal came two years after the same firm paid Hilton Hotels $1.95bn for the Waldorf Astoria in New York, a landmark art deco building ranked among the world’s most fabled hotels. British assets have also proved tempting for Chinese firms and wealthy businessmen looking to add to their already sizeable clutch of UK investments. State-backed China General Nuclear took a 30% stake in the £24bn Hinkley Point C nuclear power plant, helping France’s government-owned energy group EDF fund the project. While Hinkley was the highest-profile Chinese foray into the UK, its investors have also showed they are partial to English football clubs, particularly those from the West Midlands. Entrepreneur Guochan Lai bought West Bromwich Albion for a sum thought to be between £150m and £200m earlier this year. Businessman Tony Xia spent £76m to buy Aston Villa, even after the club had been relegated from the Premier League, vowing to restore the club to its former glory. Investment group Fosun International paid £45m to gain control of Wolverhampton Wanderers. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Chinese businessman Tony Xia bought Aston Villa for £76m earlier this year. Photograph: Neville Williams/Aston Villa FC via Getty Images Among the larger British acquisitions by Chinese firms in 2016 was the £1.4bn that travel firm Ctrip.com paid for flight comparison website Skyscanner. The takeover was announced just a day after the chancellor, Philip Hammond, promised to stem the flow of British firms being sold to foreign investors before reaching their full potential. Government-backed SinoFortone sealed a much smaller but diplomatically significant deal when it bought a 16th-century Buckinghamshire pub for an undisclosed fee. The Plough at Cadsden, Buckinghamshire – a rural tavern near Chequers, the official country retreat used by British prime ministers – hosted former PM David Cameron and Chinese premier Xi Jinping during a diplomatic visit that saw them set the world to rights over a pint of Greene King IPA. Chinese investors were also involved in the consortium that agreed to pay £13.8bn by a majority stake in the National Grid’s gas pipeline network. This year’s deals increase the scale of investment into the UK from China, which already owns or holds large stakes in household names such as Weetabix, Pizza Express and Thames Water. One huge deal that was agreed this year but may not complete until early 2017 is ChemChina’s $43bn takeover of Swiss seeds and pesticides giant Syngenta. The deal would be China’s largest ever foreign acquisition and is seen as a key plank of its strategy to ensure food security for its huge population. The bright lights of Hollywood have also attracted Chinese money. Investment group Wanda, headed by China’s richest man Wang Jianlin, paid $3.5bn for the Legendary studio behind films including Godzilla and Pacific Rim. Elsewhere, copper-processing company Anhui Xinke New Materials proved a more unlikely investor in the silver screen. The firm paid $350m for the company that owns Voltage, the studio behind Oscar-winning films The Hurt Locker and Dallas Buyers’ Club.

{ "title":"The Guardian view on child refugees: an appeal to give what you can", "content": "Hassan was 14 when he fled Damascus on his own to join family in western Europe. He has made it safely to Athens. Like many of the young refugees, what he most wants is the chance of an education and a future. But now he is stuck, and he has been for weeks. One of the toughest things these young lone refugees must face is uncertainty. Hassan (not his real name) has just learned that he will be going nowhere for at least another four months; his first interview with the authorities who must process his application to get to his family in Berlin will not happen before April. But at least he is no longer eking out a perilous existence on the city streets, trying to avoid the pimps, the people smugglers and the drug dealers that prey on refugee children travelling alone. Help Refugees, one of the three charities the Guardian and Observer are supporting this Christmas, cannot help his battle with bureaucracy. But it has rescued Hassan from the street, and it’s paying for his accommodation; with 63,000 refugees in Greece overwhelming state services, it’s all down to charities like Help Refugees. Last year’s Guardian and Observer appeal, which raised an extraordinary and unprecedented £2.6m for refugee charities, was made against the backdrop of a crisis that was self-evidently one of the great humanitarian disasters of our time. It was clear then that it was unlikely to be over within the year. But not only are hundreds of thousands of people still fleeing war and hunger; the savage turmoil in Syria remains the biggest driver of the crisis. Readers are responding even more generously than last year, partly in angry riposte to the mean and laggardly response of the British government to those who want to join family in the UK. Help Refugees was set up 16 months ago by a group of friends, frustrated by official inaction and inspired to help the refugee crisis in Calais. Their original plan was to raise £1,000 to buy food and clothes. In a week they had collected £56,000 and tonnes of donated goods. In the space of a year they raised £3m. Help Refugees is now one of Europe’s largest distributors of emergency aid, supporting more than 50 projects in Greece, Turkey, France and Syria. Safe Passage, another charity set up in response to the crisis by Citizens UK, tries to fill another gap in the journey that child refugees face by identifying unaccompanied minors on the streets of Greece and Italy, and in the camps and hostels in Germany and France – and sometimes in police cells. Then it works with other NGOs to provide a legal route to get them to the UK. It successfully lobbied parliament to amend the Immigration Act to allow more unaccompanied minors into the country. With Help Refugees, it was awarded a Liberty Human Rights award, a new award given in memory of the MP Jo Cox. But for many of the child refugees, reaching the UK is not the end of their journey. That is where the Children’s Society steps in. It runs a network of nine programmes across England that support young refugees, asylum seekers and migrants. It can help provide legal advice and housing support, advocacy, mentoring and befriending, help with language skills, therapeutic support, social and creative activities, and life skills, from money management to relationship counselling. Readers’ generosity has already exceeded all records.

I had been thinking along very similar lines myself. Perhaps I could go a little further. Here at All Saints church in Kingston-upon-Thames, a busy, seven-days-a-week town-centre church, we have just enjoyed huge congregations at our four main Christmas services. The same will have been true of thousands of other churches of all Christian denominations throughout the country. Of course, we know very well that most of the people who have come to church during the last couple of weeks, people of all ages and of various ethnicities, will not be with us Sunday by Sunday – although many will be. But the fact is that they were there willingly and apparently gladly too, not under compulsion. It is clear to me that we are meeting a need – arguably an instinct that is deeply embedded in the national DNA – to go church at special times. Christian Britain is emphatically not dead. It may be different from the way it was in previous eras, but there is life and vitality in abundance in our churches, which by their very existence are making an invaluable contribution to the country’s precious reservoir of social and cultural capital. It would be good to see more of this acknowledged in the pages of the Guardian, rather than the weary but all too familiar journalistic tropes of “emptying pews”. There’s really so much more going on than that. John Dewhurst Churchwarden, All Saints Church, Kingston-upon-Thames • Re your report (Pope says Christmas has been ‘taken hostage by materialism’, 26 December), who exactly is the hostage-taker? Pope Francis conveniently forgets that it was Christians who took pagans’ midwinter festival hostage. After centuries under Christmas’s yoke, people are free once more to celebrate the lengthening days and the promise of spring in, yes, a material way. In return, Christmas has not been taken hostage: the church is still free to celebrate Jesus’s birth, but it does nobody any favours in our increasingly divided world to set that spiritual celebration against the materialist instinct to bring light and laughter, food and drink, into the darkest days of our northern winter.

{ "title":"NHS mental health services failing young people, say psychiatrists", "content": "NHS services for the soaring numbers of children who have self-harmed, tried to end their life or are having a breakdown are woefully substandard and risk prolonging their suffering, according to their psychiatrists. More than seven out of 10 (72%) consultant psychiatrists who specialise in treating children and adolescents say that NHS care for under-18s experiencing a crisis in their mental health is either inadequate (58%) or very inadequate (14%), according to a survey undertaken for the Guardian. Only 19% said NHS services were adequate and just 9% said they were good. Experts said that the results of the survey, in which 253 of about 2,000 specialist psychiatrists working in Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) care took part, are further proof of how poor NHS services are for the growing number of children and young people struggling with serious psychological and psychiatric illnesses. Earlier this month, the Guardian disclosed that the NHS in England is sending under-18s with life-threatening eating disorders for residential care in Scotland because it regularly runs out of beds. “These are worrying findings. They are from very experienced clinicians who look after the most troubled young people in the country, children and young people who are having mental health crises and who are in a desperate way. They tell us that NHS care for children and young people in mental health crisis is very patchy,” said Peter Hindley, the chair of the Royal College of Psychiatrists’ faculty of child and adolescent psychiatry, which undertook the research. “These young people feel very upset, very distressed, they may have self-harmed, they have very negative self-thoughts, possibly including suicidal intent, and they feel hopeless and that they can’t go on. Some may recently have tried to take their own lives,” he added. The survey results come as pressure on mental health services for children is increasing, with figures from NHS Digital showing that the number of under-18s attending A&E in England due to a mental health crisis has risen by more than half in the past five years. Those turning up as a result of psychiatric conditions such as psychosis more than doubled from 6,950 in 2010-11 to 14,917 in 2014-15, while those seeking treatment after harming themselves rose from 13,504 to 17,019 over the same period. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Jeremy Hunt, the health secretary, recently said CAMHS services were the NHS’s greatest area of weakness in the care it provides. Photograph: Alamy One major problem was A&E staff being unsympathetic to under-18s who end up there seeking care in the midst of their mental health crisis. “They sometimes encounter a very negative attitude from A&E staff, such as being told that they are wasting staff time, why have they come, and that they are wasting valuable resources that other people need, and staff not realising the severe distress that these children and young people are experiencing. This can be very bad for their health,” said Hindley. Three out of four psychiatrists said that the inadequacy of child and adolescent mental health crisis services meant that the young person’s mental state could deteriorate further, while 71% said it resulted in an increased chance of risky behaviour, including impulsive behaviour or aggression to others. Two thirds (66%) said that a failure to give young people in crisis immediate expert help meant that psychiatric problems were in danger of becoming more chronic as a result. Jeremy Hunt says child mental health services are NHS's biggest failing Read more Services for children in crisis were also hampered by a lack of inpatient beds for under-18s, delays in their condition being assessed and a postcode lottery in out-of-hours crisis care, in which a psychiatrist or mental health nurses comes and assesses the young person, Hindley added. “This feedback from clinicians working at the frontline exposes the depths of the crisis facing child and adolescent mental health services in England. Where else in the NHS do 72% of our doctors tell us that the services being provided are inadequate or very inadequate?”, said Luciana Berger MP, a member of the Commons health select committee and ex-shadow minister for mental health. “This worsening situation is totally unacceptable and compromises the recovery and future life chances of some of the most vulnerable young people in our country,” she added. Sarah Brennan, the chief executive of the charity Young Minds, said that for such distressed and vulnerable young patients, getting timely help was vital. “When a child goes through a mental health crisis, getting the right support quickly can be life-saving. But at the moment, too many children are being placed on adult wards or in police cells, or are forced to travel long distances to find the nearest available bed. Our helpline often receives calls from parents who are desperate because of the lack of appropriate services,” she said. Cuts in recent years to early intervention services provided by the NHS and local councils meant children’s mental health problems worsened because they were not detected or treated quickly enough, often leaving schools to pick up the pieces, Hindley added. Councils’ spending on early intervention schemes fell from £3.2bn a year in 2010-11 to just £1.4bn in 2014-15. Jeremy Hunt, the health secretary, recently said that CAMHS services were the NHS’s greatest area of weakness across the range of care it provides. Responding to these new findings, he said: “Every child in crisis should get the support they need, which is why we are investing £1.4bn in children and young people’s mental health care, and why every local area is transforming their services. “There are a record number of CAMHS beds and there will be liaison mental health services in every A&E by 2020. But we know that must be done and we will say more on our plans to improve children’s mental health services soon,” Hunt added. • In the UK, the Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123. In the US, the National Suicide Prevention Hotline is 1-800-273-8255.

{ "title":"Welcome to crocodile country: the remarkable comeback of Australia's Jaws of the north", "content": "For the people of Australia’s tropical north, a wary coexistence with crocodiles is a fact of life. Protected for more than four decades after being hunted to near extinction, the ancient reptile – on the credible numbers that are available – has staged a remarkable recovery. Rogue crocodiles: Indigenous councils want more power 'before a human life is taken' Read more In the Northern Territory there are now as many as 100,000 saltwater crocodiles, up from just 3,000 in 1971. There are similar estimates in neighbouring Queensland but the true population will not be known until the first systematic government survey is completed over the next three to five years. With that resurgence has come inevitable reminders that in natural settings people and crocodiles share, the former’s place at the top of the food chain can be an illusion. Keith Saalfeld, a principal scientist with the NT environment and natural resources department, says it is worth noting that crocodiles, although deadly, are “one of the laziest animals on the planet”. “Everything for them is about how much energy it costs to do something for what it gets in return,” he says. It’s not uncommon to see one sitting on the banks of a river with its mouth open, “waiting literally for a fish to swim inside their mouth”. “Crocs are a stalk-and-ambush predator … They don’t go chasing things like a cheetah. They hide and sneak up very carefully and wait and wait until whatever they’re after finally moves within their range of grab.” Official figures record 29 known deaths across the Top End since hunting was outlawed: 21 in the NT since 1974 (including four in 2014) and eight in Queensland since 1985. Facebook Twitter Pinterest A crocodile will sit on the banks of a river with its mouth open ‘waiting for a fish to swim inside its mouth’. Photograph: Shutterstock/Tim Ezzy The impact of fatal crocodile attacks arguably lies as much in their inherent horror as their frequency. Highly publicised coronial inquiries into two crocodile attacks in the NT last year heightened community fear. Lanh Van Tran was taken by a 4.5-metre crocodile from the banks of the Adelaide river in front of his wife. Two months earlier, a 4.7-metre saltie latched on to the outstretched arm of Bill Scott, an experienced fisherman who had sought to steady himself after the creature had rocked his boat on a billabong. Crocodiles, although deadly, are one of the laziest animals on the planet Keith Saalfeld Until this year the last fatal attack in Queensland was in 2009 when five-year-old Jeremy Doble was taken by a crocodile in front of his older brother on the family property on the Daintree river in the state’s north. Then last May, a tourist, Cindy Waldron, 46, was arm in arm with a friend on a moonlight walk through shallow water at Thornton beach, near the Daintree rainforest in north Queensland, when a crocodile struck. Such cases invariably revive calls for protections to be scrapped in favour of the old lethal approach. Culling and even safari hunting will restore humans’ rightful place as apex predator amid an explosion in crocodiles, some argue. Australian territory minister invites visit by Trump – crocodile insurance included Read more The NT and federal governments – the latter overseeing laws that protect crocodiles – tend to humour these calls and then reject them. They bow to expert advice from the likes of Saalfield, who says short of wiping out crocodiles entirely waterways could never be considered safe. “What we currently believe is that a cull is not going to have a great deal of impact in terms of making us able to say it’s safe to go swimming in that particular area,” he says. In Queensland, the state opposition flirted briefly with the idea of culling before ruling it out – after being told to “grow a spine” by the environment minister. That was immediately after opposition from the likes of Terri Irwin, wife of the late “Crocodile Hunter” Steve, whose famous handle belied his staunch support of the species’ protected status. The most prominent calls for culling can often be traced to the same source. Bob Katter, the veteran independent federal MP from north Queensland, routinely makes a colourful case. Last month he accused Terri Irwin of being disconnected from the “world of reality”. “I don’t care if she’s St Gabriel’s mother, we’re being eaten and ripped to pieces,” he said. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Terri Irwin is vehemently opposed to culling crocodiles. Photograph: Matt Roberts/Getty Images Katter claimed Indigenous Australians had historically kept croc numbers in check by harvesting their eggs. “If you are a respected naturalist you would know that this was the territory of man, not the territory of crocodiles,” he said. In the closing months of 2016, the Queensland environment department began investigating three cases of people in the north reportedly trying to illegally catch crocodiles by baited fishing lines. The environment minister, Steven Miles, slammed the reported behaviour as “frankly unbelievable” and “seriously life-risking”. One of the alleged cases involved someone seemingly trying to bolster their social media presence”. Calls for crocodiles to be killed are notably absent among families of recent victims. In a powerful message at a public meeting in Port Douglas last month, Steve Doble invoked the deaths of his son and of Waldron to argue against crocodile culls. “I would like everyone to respect the fact that we lost loved ones because of a mistake made by human beings,” he said. “Stop always looking at the wildlife and saying it’s their fault. We are land-based creatures. If we don’t go in their water it won’t happen.” The family of Waldron had the same attitude after of her death, says Julia Leu, the mayor of Douglas shire council. “It was dreadful and we really felt for them,” she says. “And even they weren’t calling for any culls. They just acknowledge it was just a really sad event and a lack of judgment.” Woman shoos away crocodile in Northern Territory as rangers call for safety measures Read more It is understood Waldron was warned three times about a crocodile that had been shadowing a tour boat off the beach on the morning of her death. It was the third recorded death in the Daintree region, more than anywhere else in Queensland in living memory. And yet the idea of “people swanning in paying $30,000 just to knock off a few crocs” was equally horrifying to locals, Leu says. “We acknowledge the fact we live in crocodile habitat,” she says. “There are classic do’s and don’ts. No one in their right mind would swim in the Daintree river. You certainly wouldn’t go dipping late at night in any sort of murky waters. For a long time, any parent with children has been very, very wary.” Still, more can be done to improve safety, with more signs and brochures to warn tourists in particular, Leu says. Anecdotal evidence is that more crocs are cropping up in places they haven’t been seen before, including popular beaches. “We don’t know the reasons,” she says. “Is it hotter? Is it because of a change in climate?” Crocs that pose a danger should be promptly removed, says Leu, which is not always the case when environment department officials are responding from more than 100km away in Cairns. Douglas shire council wants the state government to allow trained Indigenous rangers and other locals in remote areas to share that responsibility. The local council also wants to trial “hazing”. It sounds like a school bullying ritual, but is the term for strategic harassment of crocs to discourage them from haunting populated areas. This could include the use of rubber bullets to stun them. But there is little public appetite in “croc country” for the lethal approach, if a Queensland government survey serves as a guide. Fewer than 14% of residents believe treating crocodiles as dangerous animals was the key to managing them, and only 3% called for culling, hunting or harvesting. More than a quarter of north Queenslanders supported conserving and protecting crocodiles, and most (52%) wanted an approach that balanced human safety and crocodile conservation. The survey concluded that “many in the community would prefer to see all or most crocodiles left alone, with public safety being achieved through community education to support safe behaviours”. Authorities in the NT maintain a mosaic of control measures, educational campaigns – including specifically for Indigenous communities – and dedicated spotlight surveys and monitoring. Traps are set across waterways and Kakadu national park. In high population areas such as greater Darwin, any reported crocodile is considered a problem and rangers attempt to catch and remove it. The animal goes straight to a crocodile farm where it may end up as meat, a breeder or an accessory. More than 300 are taken from Darwin Harbour each year and a further 1,200 live animals are taken by licensed harvesters annually. “In that regard, there is actually what you could describe as a targeted culling process already happening,” Saalfield says. Egg harvesting has less of an impact on the population than expected, as more than 80% of eggs don’t survive to hatch owing to poor nesting. Licensed harvesters are allowed to take up to 90,000 eggs from the wild each year. It’s a hairy job that often involves one person with a long stick finding and distracting the mother while a second person snatches the eggs. NT crocodile farms supply skins to some of the world’s most sought-after high-end brands. Since repopulation is no longer a goal, the growth of the $25m industry is now a key driver of crocodile conservation. It and the tourism value are significant boosts to jobs and the economy in the NT, particularly for its Indigenous communities, hundreds of whom are on crocodile-inhabited country and waterways. In the NT, numbers approach the pre-hunting era estimates of up to 140,000, where Saalfield expects they will plateau. “That’s what the habitat will support,” Saalfield says. “The limit on the size is the available nesting habitat, and we’ve got reasonable info that all the available nesting habitat is being used.” This probably also applies across the Top End. No longer endangered but still protected, for crocodiles it is now habitat and not human hunters that will determine their ultimate numbers.",diasaster:0},

Choi Soon-sil, a longtime friend of the president, has repeatedly ignored summons to appear before a parliamentary committee investigating a corruption scandal that triggered Park’s impeachment this month. So the politicians came to her, with the committee organising a special hearing on Monday morning – with TV cameras – inside the detention facility. Choi initially refused to leave her cell, but eventually agreed to meet eight selected members of the committee behind closed doors. Citing the politicians, the Yonhap news agency reported that Choi denied all her charges, including allegations that she colluded with the president and set up two dubious foundations that were later used for her personal gain.

She said she was feeling “dizzy” both physically and mentally and refused to answer most of the politicians’ questions during the near three-hour meetings, Yonhap said. Two former top presidential aides being held in a separate facility also refused to appear for questioning. There are no legal grounds for forcing witnesses to attend a parliamentary hearing, although they can be held in contempt and face a maximum five-year prison term for not doing so. South Korea impeachment vote: the key facts behind a presidential crisis Read more The national assembly voted to impeach Park earlier this month, stripping away her substantial executive powers. She remains president in name, pending a decision by the constitutional court on whether to ratify parliament’s impeachment motion. Earlier on Monday, prosecutors seized documents during a raid on the central Seoul residence of Kim Ki-choon, who served as Park’s chief of staff between 2013-15. Kim has a long association with Park’s family, having also served her father – the late military strongman Park Chung-hee who led the country for 18 years after seizing power in a 1961 military coup. Those close ties have led to allegations that he must have been aware of the inappropriate influence that Choi – dubbed a “female Rasputin” by the local media – wielded over the president. Park allegedly leaked confidential documents to her friend, and allowed her to meddle in state affairs – including the appointments of senior officials. • This article was amended on 25 January 2017.

{ "title":"Philip Green demands Dominic Chappell pays into BHS pension deal", "content": "Sir Philip Green wants the Pensions Regulator to force Dominic Chappell, the former owner of BHS, to put money into the failed retailer’s pension fund as part of any settlement to resolve the £571m deficit in the scheme. Green has made a payment into the scheme from Chappell or his company Retail Acquisitions a condition of any rescue deal, according to sources close to negotiations. BHS collapsed into administration in April, leading to the loss of 11,000 jobs and leaving a £571m pension black hole. The demise of the 88-year-old retailer sparked a public and political outcry because Green and Chappell, the former owners, made millions from the business. Green owned BHS for 15 years until he sold it to Chappell, a former bankrupt, for £1. During his ownership, the Green family and other shareholders collected at least £580m from BHS. Chappell’s company Retail Acquisitions received payments of up to £25m from BHS despite owning the department store chain for just 13 months until it collapsed. Green promised to “sort” the problems facing the BHS pension scheme in June when he appeared in front of a parliamentary committee, but no deal has been forthcoming. The Pensions Regulator has started legal proceedings against Green and Chappell in an attempt to force them to fill the deficit. It is understood to be seeking around £350m from Green and as much as £17m from Chappell. However, a source close to the situation confirmed that negotiations have taken place between Green and the regulator since it initiated legal action in November. Those involved in the talks believe a settlement could be agreed early in the new year, before the regulator proceeds to the next stage. As part of any deal, it is understood that Green wants the regulator to ensure that Chappell pays into the pension scheme as well. The billionaire tycoon believes he was misled by Chappell about his track record in business and the money that Retail Acquisitions was paid by BHS. Green declined to comment. Chappell told the Guardian that he fulfilled all his duties as a director of BHS and “at no stage did we trade immorally”. He blamed Green for the collapse of BHS because of his failure to support the pension scheme after he sold the retail chain. Chappell said he had agreed a “deal in principle” with the regulator and the Pension Protection Fund, the government-backed lifeboat scheme, to restructure the pension fund before BHS collapsed. This involved Green pumping in £127m, BHS making annual contributions for the next five years, and the Pension Protection Fund (PPF) taking a 30% stake in the retailer. However, Green did not agree to the proposal, according to Chappell. Facebook Twitter Pinterest The retail chain collapsed in April. Photograph: Jack Taylor/Getty Images The former owner of BHS also criticised the conduct of the Pensions Regulator, saying that the retailer was “screwed” by the investigation into the pension scheme shortly after it was sold by Green. This prevented Retail Acquisitions hiring a top chief executive and affected its finances, Chappell said. “A big notice to them, why don’t they look themselves in the mirror and look at how they behaved through the whole process?” A spokesperson for the Pensions Regulator said: “We have issued warning notices setting out evidence for use of our contribution notice power and our financial support direction power, to a number of parties including Sir Philip Green. “The warning notice is an important milestone in our work to obtain redress for the thousands of members of the BHS schemes who have been placed in this position through no fault of their own. “Those who have received the warning notices now have the right to make representations to us, which we will consider and respond. At that stage, if we decide to progress the case, it will be heard by our determinations panel, which is independent of the case team and will determine whether to exercise the powers in this case. We cannot give specific timeframes but we would expect a panel hearing during 2017. “We remain in discussion with Sir Philip’s advisers. Any settlement offer we accept has to be robust enough to stand the test of time and mean that members and the PPF are not left in a worse position further down the road.” Alan Rubenstein, chief executive of the PPF, added: “The BHS pension schemes remain in the PPF assessment period, and members continue to be protected and paid at PPF levels of compensation. “This means members who were retired when we started looking at the schemes will continue to receive 100% of what was in payment, while members who retired since then will receive 90% of what they were promised, subject to a cap. “We are working closely with the BHS pension trustees who continue to administer the schemes. Meanwhile the liquidator is now working to maximise the recovery to the pension schemes.”",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Encounters with George Michael – 'His publicist thought I was tabloid scum'", "content": "There was something wonderful about George Michael. Great singer (when he hadn’t smoked too much), great looking (though he didn’t like one side), great songwriter (before he got creative block), great personality (when not too stoned), and of course a great source of tabloid scandal. He didn’t give many interviews, but when he did he really did give good interview (I interviewed him twice, in 2005 and 2009). He didn’t believe in holding back. The last time we met was at his home in Highgate for that second interview. Again, that was typical Michael. Few pop stars let you anywhere near their real life; Michael showed you everything when the time was right. He was a recluse of sorts, but he hid in plain sight. Everybody knew George lived opposite the big pub, that he was likely to drive into the front window of Snappy Snaps when he’d had a toke too many, that he frequented Hampstead Heath most nights for casual sex. Obsessive fans would wait for days outside his house hoping for a glimpse, photo or chat. There were a couple outside that time I was there – they’d come from Germany on the off-chance. His home was frequently stalked. George Michael: 'I'm surprised I've survived my own dysfunction' Read more It was a dark December day, and George was in confessional mode. When I’d interviewed him four years earlier, much of the discussion was about death (he felt he was cursed following the death of his mother and boyfriends; even the puppy he bought to replace his dead dog had drowned), and his inability to write. He was haunted by his creative block, though he always insisted he was one chorus away from a purple patch. George was a complex man. What had been so private in his life (his sexuality) became an open book. What had been so public (his music) became strangely private. He told me he was in the studio writing new songs, but when I asked about them he became coy and embarrassed. So he smoked spliff after spliff and stuck with what he regarded as safe territory – sex and drugs. There had been stories in the tabloids that he had been caught cottaging on the Heath with a pensioner who resembled Bernard Manning. Michael was outraged by the reports. There was something sweet as well as narcissistic about him. Yes, he was a bit embarrassed about how the story reflected on him, but he also felt for the man. “His only crime was being the least fortunate looking person to come off the Heath after me.” And was the cottaging true? Of course, he said. As if that wasn’t enough, he provided a run-through of a typical day in the life. “I normally get up about 10am, my PA will bring me a Starbucks, I’ll have a look at my emails … Then, if I’m in the mood, I’ll come up to the office in Highgate, do some work, writing, backing tracks or whatever. Come home. Kenny [his then boyfriend] will be here, the dogs are here. Maybe eat locally, hang out, and then probably go off and have a shag or have someone come here and have a shag.” Michael brought out the paternal in me. There had been reports that he had been cautioned for possession of crack, but he had never talked about it. As I asked him about it I could feel my voice changing. We were the same age, but I could have been his father. Facebook Twitter Pinterest George Michael: singer, songwriter, pop superstar, dies aged 53 I asked if he’d been smoking crack, and he blustered about doing things at different times he wasn’t proud of. In the end, I asked him to look me in the eye and tell me whether he had been smoking crack on that occasion. “Was I? On that occasion? Yeah.” he finally mumbled like a lost little boy. 'There was so much death' Read more The interview ended up making the news. It wasn’t just the crack and the cottaging, it was what he’d said about Elton John, who had told people he was worried about Michael. “Elton lives on that. He will not be happy until I bang on his door in the middle of the night saying, ‘Please, please, help me, Elton. Take me to rehab.’ It’s not going to happen. You know what I heard last week? That Bono … Oh for God’s sake …” He’s choking on his laughter. “Geri [Halliwell] told Kenny that Bono, having spoken to Elton, had approached Geri to say, ‘What can we do for George?’ This is what I have to deal with because I don’t want to be part of that social clique. All I’d have to do to stop it is hang out in London, so people realise I don’t look close to death.” But, of course, they were all right to worry for him. Michael lived a short drive away from me. Despite the spliffs, he insisted on driving me home. Typical of his generosity, if a little reckless on my part (this was only a few months before the Snappy Snaps incident). I asked him if he’d knock on the door while I hid. My elder daughter answered the door, said “It’s George Michael!” and almost passed out. His publicist hated the interview, and said I was the worst kind of tabloid scum. George was perfectly happy with it. He gave me his email, but he was a hopeless correspondent, and never replied. Then, one day, out of the blue I got a gloriously optimistic email from him. Hi Simon, I’m sure the right time for another interview will come. In hindsight you may consider me a little less paranoid than you thought I was the last time we met. I considered joining the Leveson inquiry fiasco but decided against it, partially because there were so many idiots involved but also because I believe fuck all will change. I did however send them the extensive letter that the poor old bastard they tried to “attach” me to (on every level :) at Hampstead Heath sent me. He told me how they blackmailed him without even telling him who he was supposed to have met up there in the dark, and some other horrific details of his ordeal, poor bastard … It had a ghastly effect on him, and as no one gives a shit about celebs I thought his evidence might be of more use. Plus, being totally honest, I couldn’t help wanting to let the world know that portly pensioners are not to my taste. Even in the dark :) I feel great these days, clean as a whistle, and with almost a complete album ready to go, this year is going to be a good one i think. Would make a lovely change. I hope you and your family are well, was lovely to meet them. Take care , The Singing Greek xx That was four years ago. The album never materialised.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Monte dei Paschi bailout shouldn't be seen as a done deal, says ECB member", "content": "A bailout of struggling Italian bank Monte dei Paschi should not be seen as a done deal, a key European Central Bank policymaker has said. Jens Weidmann, president of Germany’s Bundesbank, said the Italian government ought to consider whether it should rescue the bank if it is in a bad financial state. “For the measures planned by the Italian government the bank has to be financially healthy at its core,” he said in an article published German newspaper Bild. “The money cannot be used to cover losses that are already expected. All this must be carefully examined,” added Weidmann, a member of the ECB’s governing council. The ECB has taken a tough line with Italy’s third-largest bank, refusing to give it more time to find private investment. The Italian government approved a state bailout plan last Friday after the Siena-based bank, which can trace its roots back to 1472, failed to convince investors to fund a €5bn (£4.25bn) cash injection. It plans to dip into a €20bn fund approved by the government earlier this month for the purpose of propping the bank up if no rescue plan could be secured elsewhere. The bailout plan was spurred by Monte dei Paschi’s poor results in ECB “stress tests”, a system set up by the European Union after the financial crisis to measure banks’ resilience to unexpected economic shocks. Stress tests are intended to ensure that taxpayers are not asked to pick up the tab for multi-billion pound bailouts, such as those that the British government orchestrated to save Lloyds and Royal Bank of Scotland. Fears about the strength of Monte dei Paschi began to mount after it came last out of 51 European banks in the ECB’s latest round of tests in July. The bank was told to shore up its finances by the end of the year or face being wound down. “These (rules) are meant especially to protect taxpayers and put responsibility on investors. State funds are only intended as a last resort, and that is why the bar is set high,” Weidmann told Bild. Monte dei Paschi’s problems have piled up since the 2008 banking crisis, when it paid €9bn (£7.6bn) for Banca Antonveneta. The deal doubled its size and turned it into Italy’s third largest bank behind UniCredit and Intesa Sanpaolo. It bought Banca Atonveneta from Santander, which had acquired the Italian bank during the three-way bid for Dutch bank ABN Amro, a deal that was a key factor in the taxpayer bailout of Royal Bank of Scotland. Three years ago Monte dei Paschi’s problems escalated. The Sienese bank asked the government for €4bn amid a scandal over loss-making derivatives contracts and alleged fraud. It has gone back to the the government for funds after talks with private investors failed, with Qatar’s sovereign wealth fund thought to have scuppered the plan by refusing to take part. The Italian government already has a 4% stake in Monte dei Paschi.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"The liberal fightback starts now. Can the Lib Dems lead it?", "content": "Could 2017 be the year of a Liberal Democrat revival? With the party reduced to a rump of eight MPs at the last election, down from 57 the time before, it’s hard to believe there is a future for them. But let’s look for a moment at the Richmond Park byelection. A Conservative majority of more than 22,000 was overturned by one of the most energetic campaigns of recent years. Voters report phone calls throughout the day, visits to offer lifts, with up to four checks made on canvassed voters during election day to make sure they went to the polling booth. The operation was masterminded by the Lib Dems themselves, but they couldn’t have won without support from other parties too, under the banner of “Vote for Europe”. This organisation, including many Labour voters, was happy to endorse the Lib Dem candidate, Sarah Olney, whose hostility to Brexit is well known. Looking at the efficiency of this campaign, and contemplating the woeful, divided condition of the Labour party, I’m beginning to ask myself whether we have missed a really important story. It’s understandable why the media has not made much of the Richmond Park byelection. It was an odd one – Zac Goldsmith’s resignation over an unrelated issue, Heathrow airport, and his decision to stand as an independent, without formal Tory support; the way the Lib Dems wrenched the agenda back to Europe and the way some other parties, notably the Greens, stood aside. And, in the British context, it’s an odd constituency too. Richmond Park is wealthy, one of the most highly educated constituencies in the UK, and voted fiercely to remain in the EU. For very good reasons, the political class is nervous about extrapolating to the rest of the country from anything that happens in such an elite place. Everybody is nervous of seeming to disrespect the referendum result. Nevertheless, the anger felt by pro-European liberals spreads a long way beyond Richmond, or indeed London. Since the summer, the 48% have been treated as if they simply don’t exist, and have no political worth. More than 16 million voters are being ignored when it comes to small matters such as our membership of the customs union, the future of tariffs and that of EU citizens living peaceably and prosperously among us. We are led to believe that leaving the EU is a simple binary choice and that the critical questions (which will affect the prosperity of future generations) can be left to a tiny group at the centre of government who – apparently – can’t agree anyway. Facebook Twitter Pinterest ‘Jeremy Corbyn was left declaring his enthusiasm for the referendum half-heartedly and, unsurprisingly, roughly 3 million Labour voters chose the Leave side.’ Photograph: Christopher Furlong/Getty Images This is outrageous. It cannot sustain. Even when the gap between the sides is as big as a million people, in a mature parliamentary democracy, referendums cannot be absolute, winner-takes-all events. After the Scottish referendum, the losing side re-gathered with commendable vigour and determination: “the 45%” became a badge of honour, worn on T-shirts and fluttering on flags, as the SNP saw its membership soar. Scottish politics was shaken after the referendum, and is still a long way away from settling even now. Yet across the UK, the 48% are scattered, adrift, and lacking any central voice. Labour does not have a coherent EU strategy. During the referendum, it was caught between the Bennite left’s old hostility to Europe as a capitalist club (a “bankers’ ramp”), and the Blair-era conviction that the EU offered the only road to modernity. So Jeremy Corbyn was left declaring his enthusiasm half-heartedly and, unsurprisingly, roughly 3 million Labour voters chose the leave side. Since then, while vaguely deploring some of the possible results of Brexit, and making much of conversations with European socialist parties that aren’t even in power, Labour has promised its support for the triggering of article 50. Caught between the anti-immigration views of some of its voters and liberal internationalism, Labour does not know what to say about the control of migration. It might seem unlikely but even if Labour were re-elected soon, what would that mean for our leaving the EU? Nobody has the faintest clue. After the referendum there were bold claims made about some new social movement to defend pro-European, liberal values, cutting across parties, and reaching out, particularly to younger people who were upset about the vote. There was even one large and enthusiastic march through London. The trouble is, we live in a parliamentary democracy where in the end we need parties with a coherent political line to support, or oppose. On the other end of the scale, Ukip, for all its moments of farce, hammered itself into shape. Broken by our first-past-the-post system, it was given a unique lifeline by David Cameron’s decision to hold the referendum. Pro-Europeans can’t expect anything similar in the years ahead. Can Labour win the Copeland byelection? Prepare for a bare-knuckle fight | Lewis Baston Read more The Lib Dems, of course, have a problem. For a party supposedly avowing tolerant, liberal mainstream values, to go into government with an austerity-driven rightwing Conservative government was a brand-destroying catastrophe, even leaving aside the betrayal over tuition fees. To many, that memory makes the smug, virtue-signalling style of Tim Farron’s leadership particularly infuriating. Having said that, there is one overwhelming issue facing British politics for the next few years. The way in which we leave the EU will crucially affect the kind of country we become – it’s about bread-and-butter issues, but also our fundamental values. Leave’s victory did not change what Britain has become in the postwar era. We are the same mix of people. But now, perhaps with a general election not very far off, the 48% lack a party political voice. Liberal Democrats could become it. To do so, however, they have to change. They have felt like an odd, closed political subculture, mingling provincial oppositionists – the awkward squad – with bland and watery centrists. To win the rest of us over, they have to start by being much more open about that mistake, and why they are not Tory outriders. I don’t believe they can exploit their opportunity without shaking themselves up. They need to be shocking enough to jolt the 48% into looking at them afresh. That might be possible under the current leader but it will need a full policy review, reviewing taxation and welfare, dropping their kneejerk, individualist hostility to the trade union movement, and being frank about the necessity for deals with other parties. With Labour continuing to tear itself apart, a liberal fightback in this country may have to start with the Liberal Democrats.",diasaster:0},

Responding to the reports, the UK’s deputy ambassador, Tony Kay, said he regretted the decision. “It is a disappointment that the Israeli government has announced that Prime Minister Netanyahu does not want to have a conversation with Theresa May,” Kay told Israel Army Radio on Monday. Kay had been called in with other ambassadors and senior diplomats of the other members of the security council who voted for the motion or abstained, including the US ambassador Dan Shapiro, to be reprimanded for supporting a resolution that reiterated the view of the international community that Jewish settlements are illegal and an obstacle to peace. Israel summons ambassadors for dressing down over UN resolution Read more “I’m sure there will be many conversations between the two prime ministers moving forward and we look forward to having those conversations, and we’ll certainly continue to have those conversations in Tel Aviv,” Kay said. In response to the reports, Israeli officials said no meeting had been scheduled with May. “No meeting with the UK prime minister had been set therefore no meeting was cancelled,” a spokesperson said. However, the Israeli media later reported that – despite the official denial – there had been discussions about May and Netanyahu speaking in Davos, although Britain had not been officially informed of the cancellation. The prime minister is regarded as one of the most pro-Israeli leaders in Europe, recently describing it as “a remarkable country” and “a beacon of tolerance”. Kay’s comments came as the fallout from Friday’s vote continued to reverberate, amid growing fears in Israel that the US and the security council may be considering further moves against Israel before Donald Trump is inaugurated as US president on 20 January. Facebook Twitter Pinterest US abstains from UN vote to end Israeli settlement building That has included speculation over a second security council resolution and reports that the US secretary of state, John Kerry, may be considering a speech outlining potential parameters for a two-state solution in the dying days of the Barack Obama administration. The moves come against the background of reports that Israel is to approve hundreds of new houses in occupied Jerusalem. The moves by the Obama administration, including the abstention in the security council vote on Friday, appear designed to leave a legacy of acts that can be used by the EU, the international criminal court and other institutions to continue to pressure Israel over settlement and the moribund peace process even if Trump – as appears highly likely – pursues a one-sided and vigorously pro-Israel foreign policy. On Monday night Donald Trump made clear his thoughts on the effectiveness of the UN. The president-elect wrote: Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) The United Nations has such great potential but right now it is just a club for people to get together, talk and have a good time. So sad! December 26, 2016 On Friday, Trump warned after the resolution passed: “As to the UN, things will be different after Jan. 20th,” referring to the day he takes office. Israel has warned of further retaliation to come against the UN and countries that supported the resolution. That includes the emergence of further details on the UN agencies Israel is considering sanctioning as part of its diplomatic blitz, including cutting funding. Among the reported targets is the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), which has long been in Israel’s sights and runs schools and provides housing and facilities in refugee camps in the occupied territories. Israel to ‘reassess’ ties with UN, says Benjamin Netanyahu Read more It is also being suggested that Israel will promote its own UN resolution that would set rules of conduct for UN employees so they would be made accountable for any statements regarded as being anti-Israel – although it is unclear what support if any that could muster given last week’s uncontested vote. Despite the loud noises from Netanyahu it remained unclear how much of it was bluster, designed to placate rightwing sentiments within his own Likud party and far-right coalition partners such as Jewish Home, and how much would have concrete consequences. In contrast to the recent harsh statements, Netanyahu has also reportedly warned ministers to avoid making calls for annexation of the occupied territories for fear of promoting further moves aganist Israel. The latest planned reported moves also come amid evidence of a mounting backlash against Netanyahu’s handling of the situation. On Monday Yesh Atid, the party of one of Netanyahu’s biggest rivals on the right, Yair Lapid, urged the Knesset to summon Netanyahu to explain the “dangerous deterioration in Israel’s foreign relations” following the vote. Israeli columnists also continued to damn Netanyahu’s handling of the fallout with Ben Caspit, of the Maariv, describing his “campaign of chastisement” as the “most unwarranted and looniest in the world of diplomacy in modern history”.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Talented and unique: George Michael took a singular path to stardom", "content": "On Christmas Eve, the night before George Michael’s death was announced, BBC4 broadcast a repeat of a 34-year-old edition of Top of the Pops. Wham! appeared, performing their second single, Young Guns (Go For It!). It was a fantastic single, clearly made by someone with an innate understanding of how to turn what was happening at the cutting edge of black music into brassy, funny, hook-laden pop, and it confirmed Wham! as 1982’s other big new pop phenomenon after Culture Club. But they were not a band who many people felt seemed destined to leave a lasting mark. Quite the contrary. The more their records sold, the more they were sternly derided as symbolic of a shift in British pop from the socially and politically engaged post-punk era to something flimsy and depthless. On Round Here, a song about his youth in Hertfordshire from his 2004 album Patience, Michael sang about Wham! being inspired by the Specials and the Jam among others. They didn’t feel the same way. Jerry Dammers of the Specials was so incensed by Wham!’s debut single Wham Rap – with its apparently blithe attitude to rising unemployment – that he wrote a song mocking it, Bright Lights. The Jam’s Paul Weller was equally dismissive about Young Guns (Go For It!): “Go for fucking what?” he’d complained in NME. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Wham! – Young Guns. Top of the Pops As it turned out, those first impressions were wrong. Wham! were a noticeably smarter and more complex band than their brash front suggested. Wham Rap was a song not so much about indifference to unemployment as resilience in the face of it. A powerful streak of knowing irony and camp ran through their music that’s perhaps easier to see in retrospect than it was at the time. Frequently depicted as the musical incarnation of the Thatcher era, they played benefit gigs for miners during the 1984-85 strike. Marketed as rampantly heterosexual – on their first tour, Michael and his partner Andrew Ridgeley earned a degree of notoriety by stuffing their shorts with shuttlecocks, which they then threw to the screaming audience – their songs kept offering oblique suggestions that all was not quite as it seemed: “I choose to cruise,” sang Michael on Wham Rap; there’s something intriguing about quite how furious the narrator of Young Guns (Go For It!) is about his friend announcing he’s going to get married. And its beautifully turned pop songwriting was no fluke. Michael, it quickly transpired, was capable of knocking out hits to order. Every single Wham! released over the next four years entered the top 10, save for a “Megamix” of previous hits released without their consent: four of them went to No 1. Why George Michael was the greatest pop star of the MTV era Read more Their success clearly wasn’t enough for Michael. He was maturing quickly as a songwriter, as evidenced by the six and a half minutes of Everything She Wants, a lyric about being trapped in a relationship with an increasingly demanding woman to a sublime synth-funk backing, improbably stuck on the other side of the deathless Last Christmas. It was hard to avoid the suspicion that he felt constrained by Wham!: by their image, by the exclamation mark at the end of their name that seemed to suggest everything they did would be fun and frothy. At Live Aid, he appeared not with Wham! but duetting with Elton John on Don’t Let The Sun Go Down On Me, Ridgeley relegated to the ranks of backing singers, alongside Kiki Dee. Tellingly, Michael released the lovelorn Careless Whisper under his name, as if he felt it didn’t fit with the brand he had helped create. More telling still was the release of his second solo single, A Different Corner, shortly before Wham! announced their split. Wham!’s later hits increasingly tended towards irrepressible 60s soul pastiches: Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go, Freedom, The Edge Of Heaven. A Different Corner was something else entirely: a sombre, fragile, drumless drift of a song with no hook-laden chorus. The fact that it went to No 1 perhaps said more about the degree of success Wham! were enjoying at the time – their farewell concert was in front of 72,000 people at Wembley Stadium – than its commerciality. Michael had clearly been laying the groundwork for a solo career that was very distinct from Wham! The transition from teen pop star to adult artist is one of the trickiest moves to pull off successfully. He made it look bizarrely painless: Michael seemed to know exactly what he wanted and how to get it. His next solo single was a duet with Aretha Franklin, I Knew You Were Waiting (For Me), a transatlantic No 1 that went on to win a Grammy for best R&B performance. Moreover, the very fact that Michael was now working with the Queen of Soul automatically conferred a certain gravitas upon him – like the Live Aid duet with John, it suggested he had been fast-tracked from Top of the Pops into the orbit of musical legends – cementing the idea that he was now an entirely different artist to the shuttlecock-stuffing singer of Young Guns and Bad Boys. In case anyone had missed the point, his debut solo album, Faith, opened with the sound of Wham!’s Freedom played on a church organ, as if at a funeral. It went on to sell 25m copies – as many records as his former band had sold over their entire career. You could see why. Faith had it all. There was attention-stoking controversy in the shape of I Want Your Sex (anyone looking for evidence of how times have changed might alight on the fact that in 1987, not only was its video banned, some TV and radio presenters refused to even mention the song’s title). Its contents offered a succession of beautifully crafted hit singles – six in total – that ran the gamut from slick funk to pop to heartbroken ballads. It crossed musical boundaries to such a degree that it became the first album by a white artist to top the US R&B charts, something Michael was proud of. Why Wham! were positively the most misunderstood group of the 1980s Read more He was now arguably the biggest pop star in the world, but Michael still seemed dissatisfied with the nature of his success. “You look for your dreams in heaven, but what the hell are you supposed to do when they come true?” he sang, glumly, on Waiting, a track from Faith’s follow-up. He called the album Listen Without Prejudice Vol 1, as if he felt something of Wham!’s frivolity still clung to his image, and he refused to make a video for its first single, Praying For Time. The album noticeably failed to repeat Faith’s blockbuster success, although it still sold 8m copies. There were far fewer pop hooks on offer, more social commentary, a sense of melancholy introspection that infects the only two songs you could reasonably describe as uptempo. As with Wham!, you occasionally get the feeling that the still publicly closeted Michael was trying to alert fans to the truth about his sexuality: “I think there’s something you should know, I think it’s time I stopped the show, there’s something deep inside of me, there’s someone I forgot to be,” offers Freedom! ’90. If you’re occasionally struck by the sense of an artist who had made his rise to fame seem effortless trying a little too hard to be taken seriously, it also contained some of his greatest songs, not least the impossibly lovely confection of jazzy drums and floating synthesiser on Cowboys And Angels. The projected follow-up, Listen Without Prejudice Vol 2, never appeared: he gave music intended for it away to an Aids charity album and also donated the proceeds of another, Too Funky, when it was released as a single in 1992. An acclaimed appearance at the Freddie Mercury tribute concert and an EP of covers aside, Michael more or less vanished for the next four years: when he reappeared, it was with Jesus to a Child, a shattered-sounding lament for Anselmo Feleppa, who had died in 1993 from an Aids-related brain haemorrhage. The subsequent album Older was, understandably, even more bleak and solemn than its predecessor. Even the solitary dance track, the brilliant Fastlove, had a noticeable darkness to its tone: “In the absence of security, I made my way into the night.” Facebook Twitter Pinterest George Michael – Fastlove Michael later claimed the album was another attempt to quietly reveal the fact that he was gay to his fans without involving the press. When the newspapers finally did get their story two years later, with his arrest for engaging in a lewd act in a Beverly Hills toilet, it seemed to reignite the sense of sly humour that had been largely absent from his work since Wham!’s demise. His musical response was a witty celebration of the pleasures of cottaging, Outside, complete with a video depicting him performing in a toilet cubicle decked out like a disco. The police officer who arrested him claimed the video caused him “emotional distress”; his subsequent attempt to win damages was dismissed. On his covers album Songs From the Last Century, he amended the lyrics of My Baby Just Cares For Me to make a reference to the pulchritude of singer Ricky Martin: when he released a protest single attacking Tony Blair and George W Bush over the invasion of Iraq, it arrived with an animated video that variously depicted Michael in drag, dressed as Homer Simpson and seducing Cherie Blair. Over the past decade, stories about Michael’s drug use, sex life and ill-health overshadowed the music he made. He remained defiant in interviews and onstage, but it still seemed a shame: what turned out to be his final album, Patience, was often opaque, overlong and frequently required effort on the part of the listener – it really did sound like an album made by a man who smoked a lot of marijuana – but its highlights suggested his songwriting abilities were unimpaired: My Mother Had a Brother, Round Here, the glittery spectacular of Flawless (Go to the City). His first tour in 15 years, 2006’s 25 Live, was an unmitigated triumph: boldly staged so that Michael essentially faced arena audiences alone, with his backing band relegated to the shadows. It grossed more than $200m. The feeling that whatever else might have been going on in his life, he could be relied upon to create interesting music never faded: this month there was news that he was planning to make an album with Beyoncé producer Naughty Boy. It sounded like the start of an intriguing new chapter, but Michael’s musical legacy was already sealed years ago. His career showed that you could escape teen pop stardom with aplomb, or at least you could if you were Michael. It says something about the singularity of his talent that scores of artists have tried to follow it, and almost none of them has succeeded in quite the way he did. When Michael’s life ended he was an entirely different artist to the one he began as. Once mocked as flimsy and depthless, he turned out to be anything but.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Private firms earn £500m from disability benefit assessments", "content": "Two private firms have earned more than £500m in taxpayers’ money for carrying out controversial disability benefit assessments. The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) paid Atos and Capita £507m for personal independence payment (PIP) tests between 2013 and 2016, despite fierce criticism of their services by MPs. Figures up until September this year reported by the Daily Mirror suggest that 61% of the 90,000 claimants who appealed against a PIP decision by the DWP, based on these companies’ assessments, won their case at tribunal. The DWP said it was unsure where this figure came from. FTSE 100 edges higher but Capita leads the fallers Read more Hundreds have complained, many via the Guardian, that their benefits have been cut since PIP replaced the disability living allowance (DLA) in April 2013. The Liberal Democrat leader, Tim Farron, queried how Atos and Capita could have been paid such huge sums. “This adds to the suspicion that these companies are just driven by a profit motive, and the incentive is to get the assessments done, but not necessarily to get the assessments right,” he told the Daily Mirror. “They are the ugly face of business.” Figures show that the DWP paid Atos and Capita £7m in 2013, £91m in 2014, £198m in 2015, and £211m during the first 11 months of 2016. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron suggested that companies behind tests are ‘driven by profit’. Photograph: Gareth Fuller/PA A total of £382m was paid to the IT services firm Atos, a European IT services firm with headquarters in Paris, and £125m to London-based FTSE 100 company Capita. The Guardian revealed in March that the government was to review all of Atos’s major contracts from Whitehall, which amount to more than £500m, following a serious IT failure. The Cabinet Office review found they were performing “within the normal parameters of large technology contracts” and that Atos provided an appropriate level of professional support. After the PIP system was introduced, under 65-year-olds had to be reassessed and, up until October 2016, 110,000 out of 526,000 claimants who were reassessed lost their benefits. MPs criticised Atos in a report by the public accounts committee in March, saying “it did not show an appropriate duty of care to the taxpayer” and questioned why the cost of one type of assessment had risen from £115 to £190. Capita divisional managing director Chris Stroud apologised for a poor quality service in front of the committee in February. Taxpayers’ cash should go to the needy. Here’s where it actually ends up | Owen Jones Read more George Osborne announced a £4.4bn cut to benefits for the disabled in March over the course of parliament. The cuts were later shelved after the then work and pensions secretary Iain Duncan Smith resigned in protest. Theresa May’s administration has back-pedalled further on disability tests, with the work and pensions secretary, Damian Green, revealing in October that chronically sick people claiming employment and support allowance would no longer have to prove every six months that they were still ill. A DWP spokesman said: “We introduced PIP to replace the outdated DLA system and, as we invite more people to claim PIP, claims have been steadily increasing quarter on quarter since summer 2015. Payments to our providers reflect the amount of work they do for us.” An Atos spokesman said: “The Atos team undertake PIP assessments on behalf of the DWP and do not take a decision on a person’s eligibility for PIP; that decision can only be taken by the DWP. Each assessment is carried out under the guidelines delivered by the DWP.” Atos and DWP refused to comment when asked why so many appeals to PIP results were succeeding. A Capita spokesperson said: “Capita carries out PIP assessments according to DWP guidelines and professional codes of conduct.” • This article was amended on 27 December 2016. An earlier version described the assessments as being for “work capability” or “fit for work”. Atos and Capita carry out personal independence payment assessments, not fit-for-work tests.

{ "title":"Obama’s parting shot at Netanyahu is a futile gesture", "content": "In a way, Binyamin Netanyahu and Barack Obama deserve each other. Both promised great things. Both proved themselves masters of their respective political spheres. And yet both have contributed, since 2009, to a chronic deterioration in US-Israel relations and the wider Middle East meltdown. This process of polarisation and mutual alienation culminated last Friday with Obama’s active connivance in the passing of a landmark UN security council resolution. The resolution condemned all Israeli settlements in occupied Palestinian territory as a “flagrant violation” of international law that imperilled a future two-state peace. Amid talk of betrayal, the Israeli response, personally orchestrated by Prime Minister Netanyahu, has been swift and furious. Ambassadors from the 14 countries that backed resolution 2334 were carpeted at the foreign ministry on Christmas Day. Israel has withdrawn its ambassadors from two of the countries concerned, New Zealand and Senegal, and cut aid assistance to the latter. Planned diplomatic exchanges have been cancelled, future Israeli cooperation with UN agencies placed under urgent review, and civilian coordination with the Palestinian Authority suspended. “We will do all it takes so Israel emerges unscathed from this shameful decision,” Netanyahu said. If he really believes settlements undermine peace, why abstain? Why not go the whole hog and condemn them? In a sense, these are symbolic actions in response to a symbolic vote. Resolution 2334 is unenforceable. Nobody, least of all the Americans, will attempt to evict the 430,000 Jewish settlers currently living in the West Bank or the 200,000 in east Jerusalem. Nobody can force Israel to embrace John Kerry’s recycled ideas about a two-state solution, although the US secretary of state is expected to spell them out one more time before he leaves office next month. Resolution 2334 joins UN resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) in the theoretical, consistently bypassed legal canon of the Israel-Palestine issue. It says what should happen. It does not say how. Yet for all that, the US abstention and UN vote are not lacking in significance. Netanyahu’s smug suggestion that he need only wait for the advent of a Donald Trump presidency is misleading. It is likely Trump will give him a more sympathetic hearing. He may well move the US embassy to Jerusalem – a gratuitously inflammatory gesture. The personal chemistry between Trump and Netanyahu will be vastly different; insecurity, aggression and paranoia are their shared characteristics. But Trump’s vain, vague boast that he could be the one to “solve” the Israel-Palestine conflict is as insubstantial as his many other foreign policy pledges. And a Trump administration cannot simply reverse the stated will of the UN security council – backed in this case by permanent members China, Russia, France and Britain – any more than it can unilaterally scrap last year’s multinational nuclear deal with Iran. It is likely the resolution will accelerate existing moves to prosecute Israel at the international criminal court. By specifically instructing UN members to “distinguish between the territory of the state of Israel and the territories occupied since 1967”, it may also encourage new boycotts and sanctions. But more than that, the UN vote has highlighted the extraordinary extent of Israel’s international isolation under Netanyahu. Even he cannot persuasively dismiss the unanimous opinion of countries as diverse as Japan, Ukraine, Malaysia, Venezuela, Angola and Spain. It takes a lot to make an enemy of New Zealand, but Netanyahu has managed it. This was the world telling Netanyahu, with one voice, that the expanded settlement policy he has encouraged and justified is wrong – wrong legally, wrong morally, wrong politically, and wrong in terms of Israel’s future peace and security. The odd thing is, he knows this. In 2009, Netanyahu, newly re-elected, described his “vision” of a historic peace, “of two free peoples living side by side in this small land, with good neighbourly relations and mutual respect, each with its flag, anthem and government, with neither one threatening its neighbour’s security and existence”. Although he appeared to renege during last year’s election campaign, Netanyahu still claims to support a two-state solution. Now the international community’s message is unequivocal: you were right in 2009. So stop undermining the prospect of peace. Honour your promise. US abstention allows UN to demand end to Israeli settlements Read more Obama has not been much help. He, too, made a big speech in 2009, shortly after taking office, pledging a “new beginning” for the Middle East. But Obama’s so-say inspirational Cairo performance turned out to be the prelude not to transformational progress, but to regional disintegration and growing American detachment. The US withdrawal from Iraq left a political vacuum in Baghdad that Iran and its Shia allies filled. Then, in partial reaction, came the Sunni jihadists of Islamic State. The Arab spring revolts of 2011 left Washington nonplussed. In Egypt it fretted over the toppling of Hosni Mubarak and welcomed his eventual replacement by another pro-American military dictator. In Syria, Obama prematurely anticipated the demise of Bashar al-Assad, only to back away when the going got tough, letting in the Russians and the Iranians (again) and squandering US leverage. Obama never seemed to grasp the implausibility of publicly pressurising the risk-averse Netanyahu into peace talks with the Palestinians, even as Israel’s immediate neighbours fell prey to civil disorder and Islamist insurrection. As the US retreated, physically and diplomatically, Hezbollah (Iran’s and Hamas’s Lebanese ally), advanced. Little wonder, in this chaotic context, that the Obama-Kerry “comprehensive plan” for peace ran into the sand in 2014. Little wonder, perhaps, that Israelis now eye the Golan Heights, their disputed land border with Syria, with growing apprehension as Assad’s forces are advancing. Add in Libya and Yemen, for example, and Obama’s Middle East legacy is not one to be proud of. Like Netanyahu, 2009 promise went unfulfilled. And it is fitting that his final days in office should be marked by petulance and impotence. Obama did not push nearly hard enough for peace when the regional climate might have allowed it. In 2011, he vetoed a similar UN resolution, arguing US-brokered talks would find a way forward. Obama, senior partner in a dysfunctional relationship, allowed Netanyahu to beard him repeatedly, not least in the latter’s self-justificatory 2015 address to Congress. Cautious to the end, even Obama’s UN demarche on Friday was half-hearted. If he really believes settlements are undermining peace, why abstain? Why not go the whole hog and vote to condemn them? And why wait seven years? What happens next, in the dawning Trump era, is deeply worrying. A continuing, polarising stalemate over Palestinian statehood looks probable. So, too, do expanding settlements on occupied land and possibly annexations, as mooted by Netanyahu’s rightwing allies. How long before the Palestinian response grows violent once again? And how long before Netanyahu induces an impulsive, know-nothing Trump to take joint action against the bigger target, Iran?",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Communities needing libraries as much as ever", "content": "Simon Jenkins says “Our libraries are in trouble …” (22 December) and suggests the solution is to make them places of “human congregation” run by town councils and other neighbourhood groups. Our local library is already a place where many groups meet and a variety of services are provided. It also performs a public good in providing computers and internet access for those who cannot afford their own – many more people than you would think. Our county council has resisted pressures to close its libraries but they are always potentially soft targets in an era of competing demands and central government cutbacks. Our library has raised its footfall by increasing the range of services it provides. As friends of the library we support it but in no way do we provide any substitute for the work of the public servants who deliver the service. Simon Jenkins’ suggestion will only lead to an even greater patchwork of provision. The answer is to keep up the pressure on county and city councils to meet their obligations under the 1964 Museums and Public Libraries Act. And if “luvvie marches” add to that pressure, I’m all for them. Carol Quinn Chair, Friends of Chepstow Library • Simon Jenkins’ comment that his local library was “near empty” while people were busy buying books at the adjacent Waterstones may be reflective of a well-off area. My local library in Tower Hamlets, a relatively deprived inner-city area in east London, is very well used, including by pensioners who sit reading the newspapers and chatting in the cafe throughout the day, students in the computer areas and young Bangladeshi mothers with their small children after school. It is a thriving area and a huge asset to the community. Angela Smith London • Simon Jenkins joins the ranks of those who assert that, despite the evidence of bookshops’ popularity, public libraries should set books aside. Surveys of readers always put books as far and away the main reason that they use a public library. Readers, however, are increasingly dismayed at stock which is not only shrinking but of a low calibre. Librarians have become demoralised by their crucial work of book selection being farmed out to book wholesalers. These operate upon a spurious local “demographic” rather than meeting the needs of those who borrow books. What would Mr Jenkins say of a business that took such deliberate steps to alienate its users? Books should be the continual beating heart of a library. Christopher Hawtree Hove, East Sussex • Simon Jenkins suggests that a library’s strengths lay with its readers, “in their desire to congregate, share with each other, hear writers and experience books in the context of their community”. He could have been writing about my local library in Market Drayton. It is always “buzzing” with children’s reading and singing groups, talks with local writers, drop-in sessions for people researching their family histories, and even people borrowing books! But, guess what? This wonderful local facility, so much a part of many people’s lives, is under threat because of Shropshire county council’s funding cuts. Sad times. Graham Russell Market Drayton, Shropshire • I live opposite a red phone box that has been converted into a community book exchange run within the village. Every day 15-20 people visit and drop off and collect books and enthusiastic villagers clean it each week. Once every three weeks, the county library service van rumbles into the same layby. One or two people visit it, usually coming by car. This seems to me to sum up the library service as it is today, so eloquently described by Simon Jenkins. Libraries, the library service and the councils who run them must grasp the new reality that they should be run for and by their local communities. Ruth James Brinkworth, Wiltshire • If you want a local library run by, probably unskilled, volunteers and holding a lendable book stock in the hundreds or low thousands then Simon Jenkins’ promotion of running consecrated churches as all embracing communal centres is your way forward. If, however, you want a library with lendable book stocks in the tens of thousands which are regularly updated, operates a national inter-library loans system, free access to digital information formats and all managed by paid professionals, then what we currently have and are rapidly letting slip through our fingers is what you need. A “renaissance” misses the point. Libraries should not be subject to the dire hacking-back they’ve suffered by being an easy savings-target for local authorities hell bent on carrying out the dogmatic austerity-cutbacks of recent central governments. Gary Bennett Exeter • Every year people contact our charity as a result of a New Year resolution to do something positive, learn new skills and meet new people. With our training and support, they become volunteer reading helpers in local primary schools, working with children who are struggling with their reading. These volunteers really do transform lives by building pupils’ confidence and helping them reach their full potential. Every year we need more of these inspiring people to use their resolutions to make this difference. Last year alone over 200,000 children left primary school unable to read to the expected level.

{ "title":"Our secret weapon against the populist right in 2017 is hope", "content": "For Christmas, I took delivery of a puppy. It was chosen in November and the kids wanted to call it Bender, after the robot in the Simpsons-stable cartoon Futurama. I said that even if we didn’t live in the gay village of Vauxhall, I wouldn’t have a dog called Bender. “Why not?” my son asked. I explained that because as well as being a robot, Bender is a derogatory word meaning homosexual. “You’re homophobic,” he said, to which I replied: “I’m not homophobic, but other people are.” “So, why do you care?” he said. At which point I dropped arguing in favour of democracy, and suggested we all put a name into a hat, giving each of us one right of veto. I’d forgotten that there were three of them and only two of us, so after all our vetoes were deployed, the dog was still called Bender. So I did what any normal person would do: moved the goalposts and said the dog had to keep the name his first family had given him, otherwise he’d get confused. That name was Romeo, which we could all live with. Unfortunately I’d also forgotten that my daughter is called Harper, so now it looks like we have an unholy obsession with the Beckham family. The first person to notice that laughed for approximately 45 minutes. We weren’t even out of 2016 and I had already forgotten the first two laws of Brexit: just because a decision is very important doesn’t mean democracy will deliver the right answer; and once the wrong course has been embarked upon, positive thinking won’t help – things will be permanently worse for the rest of your life or, in Romeo’s case, 15 years. At a celebratory party thrown for Nigel Farage, he gave a speech that made me want to go back to bed and not wake up until I’d emigrated: “For those that are here that aren’t particularly happy with what’s happened in 2016, I’ve got some really bad news for you – it’s going to get a bloody sight worse next year.” It’s hard to see, from a UK point of view, anything happening in 2017 that is as destructive and diminishing as leaving the EU, unless we have another referendum on whether or not to bring back the death penalty. Yet it is likely, indeed almost certain, that 2017 will contain some political misery – either there will be a snap election, and the Labour party will be massacred, and this will be taken as proof not that Jeremy Corbyn doesn’t say enough, but that liberal values have been vanquished, and people who cling on to them need to stop fighting and adjust to a new reality. Alternatively, there won’t be a general election, and we’ll have to watch agape as a prime minister nobody voted for, with a majority you could fit in an UberXL, marches into negotiations of the most profound national consequence, with a plan she will not even divulge to the Queen. Facebook Twitter Pinterest ‘At a celebratory party thrown for Nigel Farage, he gave a speech that made me want to go back to bed and not wake up until I’d emigrated.’ Photograph: Manuta/Getty/iStockphoto Farage is right, in other words, and this sentence is so alien to my muscle memory, I went through seven typos to get there: those of us who hated 2016 are going to loathe 2017. However, my next year’s self will have some advantage over this year’s, which is experience. I’m not going to waste any more time, not one more morning, on despair. After the referendum, I spent the whole summer in a limbo of futility, but what’s the point arguing with people who have no respect for facts, who have no consistency, who change their story halfway through (we can be just like Norway, they said, until suddenly Norway was the most outrageous compromise; we can save huge amounts of money by leaving the EU, they said, until suddenly it was the most expensive decision ever, but somehow it was still worth it)? What’s the point engaging on political terrain where a man can call Mexicans rapists and educated people will still vote for him? The fact is, we re-engage because we have to: the alternative would be nihilism, which is not a realistic position to take up late in life. I accept that; I don’t intend to waste any more time figuring that out. The other way I tried to escape political misery was by persuading myself things weren’t as bad as they seemed; there is cause for optimism on the progressive side, ideas that are starting to come together, groups that are starting to cooperate, allies appearing from unexpected places. But the politicians ascending on a wave of division and hostility are exactly as bad as they seem: Farage as xenophobic, Johnson as self-serving, May as incompetent, Gove as narcissistic. But we will not find common ground by moving closer to any of these post-Brexit victors, we will just make the job of spreading suspicion and narrow-mindedness easier for them. I never accepted the idea of public opinion as a solid mass that moves as one and arrives at a new view of which it cannot be disabused. Yet I sometimes relaxed into that interpretation – that the people had spoken on immigration, or on the institutions of the EU, and that new reality had to be incorporated. This is simply not the case: people responded to the strongest argument, or rather, the one most trenchantly put. The only way to beat it is to make a case that is both substantively stronger and relayed with more conviction. Which feeds into my final lesson from 2016, which is to respond to the new normal by asking for more, not less: I don’t just want human, employee, civil and consumer rights protected as we leave the EU and have to build our own frameworks, I want better ones. I don’t just want to protect the welfare state, I want a new concept of security that takes in the realities of modern precariousness. All those problems that Ukip leverages in the generation of anxiety – housing shortages, overstretched public services, low wages – are real: the best solutions will be the ones that sound audaciously distant from the status quo. So 2016, in its best possible light, looks like the training montage in Rocky, the bit where we lost a few teeth, but learned how to take knocks; 2017 can be where that experience starts to count.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Revealed: British councils used Ripa to secretly spy on public", "content": "Councils were given permission to carry out more than 55,000 days of covert surveillance over five years, including spying on people walking dogs, feeding pigeons and fly-tipping, the Guardian can reveal. A mass freedom of information request has found 186 local authorities – two-thirds of the 283 that responded – used the government’s Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act (Ripa) to gather evidence via secret listening devices, cameras and private detectives. Among the detailed examples provided were Midlothian council using the powers to monitor dog barking and Allerdale borough council gathering evidence about who was guilty of feeding pigeons. Wolverhampton used covert surveillance to check on the sale of dangerous toys and car clocking; Slough to aid an investigation into an illegal puppy farm; and Westminster to crack down on the selling of fireworks to children. Surveillance has gone too far. The jig is up | Martha Spurrier Read more Meanwhile, Lancaster city council used the act, in 2012, for “targeted dog fouling enforcement” in two hotspots over 11 days. A spokeswoman pointed out that the law had since changed and Ripa could only now be used if criminal activity was suspected. The permissions for tens of thousands of days were revealed in a huge freedom of information exercise, carried out by the Liberal Democrats. It found that councils then launched 2,800 separate surveillance operations lasting up to 90 days each. Critics of the spying legislation say the government said it would only be used when absolutely necessary to protect British people from extreme threats. Brian Paddick, the Lib Dem peer who represents the party on home affairs, said: “It is absurd that local authorities are using measures primarily intended for combating terrorism for issues as trivial as a dog barking or the sale of theatre tickets. Spying on the public should be a last resort not an everyday tool.” He argued that the 2016 Investigatory Powers Act, which will take in Ripa powers alongside a raft of new measures, would restrict the ability of local authorities to monitor people’s communications. But he also said it would give “mass surveillance powers to a huge number of government bodies”. “As with any legislation, there is a significant risk that authorities will use powers in a way that parliament never intended,” added Lord Paddick, calling for proper oversight to ensure any surveillance is targeted and proportionate. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Midlothian council used the powers to monitor dog barking. Photograph: Graeme Robertson for the Guardian The freedom of information request also revealed a number of examples of councils using Ripa as a way of checking up on benefit claimants. One example was checking up on those claiming to be single parents. Other local authorities drew on the powers to crack down on the distress caused by anti-social behaviour. The London borough of Bromley gave one example in which it considered using a CCTV mobile unit to target three households that were causing “harassment, alarm and distress”, by holding parties on a communal green with loud music blaring out through amplifiers, shouting, screaming, smashing windows and riding motorbikes around in circles. The local authority also detailed the use of Ripa following a complaint about the accumulation of rubbish in a rear garden, claiming that the perpetrator was a “serial fly tipper”. The council deployed a “covert camera” in the upstairs bedroom window of another property, which gathered evidence of what was happening. More recently, it has used the law to monitor the sale of alcohol, tobacco and fireworks to people underage, and capture those illegally dumping waste in recycling centres. The deputy leader of the London borough of Bromley said he believed the legislation was far too restrictive, arguing that the victims of crime understood filming evidence that could aid prosecutions was a “minor infringement of the perpetrators so called civil liberties”. Cllr Colin Smith said: “Council officers deal with complaints day in and day out about thoroughly disgusting socially inadequate individuals fly-tipping waste and preying on the weaker, more vulnerable members of our society, normally the elderly, and this technology is key to bringing their worst excesses to heel.” He said the council kept to the letter of the law to prevent any “so called ‘spying’ taking place on law-abiding individuals”. “I’m frankly far more concerned about the rights and civil liberties of the victims and wider council tax-paying public, who are currently having to pick up the tab, than the small minority criminal element who continue to treat the rest of us with open contempt.” Lincolnshire county council had requested permission for the largest number of days – close to 4,000 – with a major 2012 operation to prevent cigarettes and alcohol being sold to underage teenagers, and attempts to stop counterfeiting at car boot sales and markets. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Lib Dem peer Brian Paddick warned the powers could be used in a way parliament did not intend without proper legislation. Photograph: Linda Nylind for the Guardian Mark Keal from Lincolnshire Trading Standards said: “Without this evidence it is incredibly difficult to get successful prosecutions and get these products off the street.” The council, alongside a number of others, stressed that while they had sought permission for a large number of days, the operations usually spanned a much shorter period. The next highest number of days requested was Birmingham, where the acting strategic director, Jacqui Kennedy, said the powers had been used to crack down on “serious fly-tipping, rogue trader operations and trading standards investigations looking at scams and counterfeiting”. “We only use Ripa when it is proportionate and reasonable and each application is agreed and signed off by a judge,” she added, insisting that it had helped catch out criminals. “And as the largest local authority in the country we frequently top statistics lists that are based solely on raw numbers.” The Home Office insisted that permissions were only granted for such covert surveillance after a rigorous authorisation procedure and independent inspection. A spokesman said: “Ripa powers are an important tool that local authorities can use to address the issues that affect many people’s lives, like consumer protection, environmental crime and benefit fraud. “The legislation makes clear that public authorities may use these techniques only when it is both necessary and proportionate to do so. 'Extreme surveillance' becomes UK law with barely a whimper Read more “Any local authority use of these powers must be independently authorised by a magistrate, who is an independent judicial figure. “The Investigatory Powers Act goes further by ensuring that in future the use of these powers will be overseen by the Investigatory Powers Commissioner, who will be a serving or former senior judge.” The act, which has been described as a snooper’s charter by critics, faced difficulties after the EU’s highest court ruled that “general and indiscriminate retention” of emails and electronic communications was illegal. Only targeted interception of traffic and location data in order to combat serious crime, including terrorism, is justified, according to a long-awaited decision by the European court of justice. Ironically, the finding came in response to a legal challenge initially brought by the Brexit secretary, David Davis, when he was a backbench MP, and Tom Watson, Labour’s deputy leader, over the legality of GCHQ’s bulk interception of call records and online messages.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Napoleon's warhorse Marengo gets ready to ride out again", "content": "“Ah, that’s it, got it moving now,” Derek Bell said in satisfaction, as he and Arianna Bernucci delicately dragged off the leg of one of the most famous horses in history. The crude iron bars and rusted bolts were exposed, which for almost two centuries have been holding together the skeleton of Napoleon’s little grey Arab stallion, Marengo. The skeleton of the horse that repeatedly carried Napoleon into victory in battle, and finally into the last defeat at Waterloo in 1815, is being taken apart by Bell, an expert on prop making and conservation, and Bernucci, a senior conservator who has been recruited from the Natural History Museum to help with a unique project. In a studio in old farm buildings in Essex, they are dismantling, conserving and reconstructing Marengo for the National Army Museum, which will reopen on its Chelsea site in spring 2017 after a three-year closure for a major rebuild. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Arianna Bernucci, a conservator from the Natural History Museum, working on remounting the skeleton of Marengo. Photograph: Natural History Museum According to a tiny silver plaque on one of the bones, the skeleton was originally mounted on its iron frame at the London Hospital by somebody called Willmott. Willmott was presumably one of the craftsmen more used to preparing human medical specimens for the teaching hospital’s museum, and didn’t cope very well with a horse. “One of the reasons for remounting the skeleton is to make poor Marengo look more like a horse. The drooping head, and the peculiar stiff position of the legs made him look more like a mule,” Sophie Stathie, a curator at the museum, said. “He was one of the most loved objects in the old museum, but every time I came into the gallery I always thought there was something sad about him.” Many contemporary images show Napoleon on his horse, the master’s arm raised brandishing a sabre, the horse rearing and snorting in excitement at the prospect of battle. He was probably about seven when Napoleon acquired him in 1799, and named him the following year after his famous victory over the Austrians at the battle of Marengo. He rode him at Austerlitz, the “battle of the three emperors” where he defeated the far larger combined forces of Austria and Russia, and at several other engagements. In the Peninsular wars, Marengo was also said to have regularly covered the 80-mile distance between Valladolid and Burgos in five hours. The horse was left behind at Waterloo when Napoleon fled. The French emperor made it back to Paris, formally abdicated, surrendered to the British, and was sent into exile on the remote island of St Helena, where he died in 1821. Marengo long outlived him. He was captured by the Grenadier Guards and brought to England, bought by Lt Col John Julius Angerstein, and spent a peaceful old age after an unsuccessful attempt to breed from him. He died in 1831, reputedly aged 38. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Marengo’s skull. Photograph: Natural History Museum Angerstein gave the skeleton – and possibly originally the grey hide, though the records are very sketchy – to the museum of the Royal United Services Institute, where by 1865 he was listed in a guide book as one of its principal attractions. In the 1960s, Marengo was given with other Waterloo material to the then new National Army Museum. The Duke of Wellington’s equally famous but much younger Waterloo horse, Copenhagen, died in 1836, aged 28 – reportedly accelerated by his fondness for sugar buns – and was buried at the duke’s Stratfield Saye estate. A marble headstone was later added, including the lines “God’s humbler instrument though meaner clay/ Should share the glory of that glorious day”. The duke was apparently enraged at a suggestion from the museum that he dig him up to display beside Marengo. The two horses starred in a fantasy love affair conducted by letter, serialised on Radio 4, with Stephen Fry as the voice of Marengo. All this time poor Marengo has been standing on only two feet. Replacements will be made for the missing hooves: one survives, silver mounted as a souvenir inkwell, on loan to the Household Cavalry, and the other probably suffered the same fate. In the new displays Marengo will be reunited with other relics from Waterloo, including weapons, uniforms, and Napoleon’s own ornate silver gilt coffee urn, abandoned like his horse when he fled the battlefield. “He was a remarkable animal, and he deserves for us to do better by him,” Stathie said.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Experts call for official guidelines on child screen use", "content": "A group of leading authors, educationalists and child-development experts is calling on the government to introduce national guidelines on the use of screens, amid concern about the impact on children’s physical and mental health. It is one of a series of measures outlined in a letter to the Guardian, highlighting what it describes as the increasingly “toxic” nature of childhood, and signed by 40 senior figures, including the author Philip Pullman, the former archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams, the psychotherapist Susie Orbach and the childcare expert Penelope Leach. Screen-based lifestyle harms children’s health | Letters Read more The letter urges the government to create a cabinet-level minister for children, with specific responsibility for auditing all government policies in order to assess their impact on children’s health and wellbeing. It calls for the development of kindergarten-style education for three- to seven-year-olds, with emphasis on social and emotional development and outdoor play; and says guidelines on screen-based technology for children up to 12 should be drawn up by recognised authorities on child health and development. It is 10 years since the group sent its first letter to the media, expressing concern about the way it believes children’s health and wellbeing are being undermined by “the decline of outdoor play, increasingly screen-based lifestyles, a hyper-competitive schooling system and the unremitting commercialisation of childhood”. Since then, they say, policy making has been “half-hearted, short-termist and disjointedly ineffective”, with obesity and mental health problems among young people approaching crisis levels. “If children are to develop the self-regulation and emotional resilience required to thrive in modern technological culture, they need unhurried engagement with caring adults and plenty of self-directed outdoor play, especially during their early years (0–7),” the letter reads. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Sue Palmer, the author of Toxic Childhood, is among the letter’s signatories. Photograph: Murdo MacLeod for the Guardian “Without concerted action, our children’s physical and mental health will continue to deteriorate, with long-term results for UK society that are frankly unthinkable.” Among the signatories is Sue Palmer, the author of the 2006 book Toxic Childhood, which tapped into parental angst about raising children in the modern world; the psychologist and educational consultant Dr Richard House; the professor of education Dr Robin Alexander; the wellbeing programme director at the London School of Economics’ centre for economic performance, Richard Layard; the former London schools commissioner Sir Tim Brighouse, the psychologist and author Steve Biddulph and a former government mental health champion Natasha Devon. Not everyone subscribes to the doom-laden view of modern childhood and the “toxic” environment in which children are growing up. Recent studies have suggested that screen-based technology can encourage reading in boys from low-income families and that there may be a positive link between computer games and academic performance. However, Palmer, who chairs the Upstart Scotland campaign to introduce kindergarten-style education for under-sevens, said: “Apart from basic material needs, like food and shelter, there are two essential ingredients if children are to survive and thrive whatever the future brings: love and play. “But consumer culture has encouraged adults to confuse both of these with stuff you can buy in the shops. We’ve also become obsessed with trying to teach kids everything they need to know. But you can’t teach things like self-regulation and resilience – they have to develop, through personal experience.” Are tablet computers harming our children's ability to read? Read more House said: “It’s nothing short of a scandal that policymakers have done next to nothing to address the ‘toxic childhood’ issues that Sue Palmer first flagged up in her iconic book over a decade ago. Indeed, matters are now far worse, with children’s mental health and behavioural problems at record levels. “The time for pussyfooting around politicians and policymakers is over, and it’s time to shame them into doing something substantive and meaningful – or future historians will doubtless look back on the current era as one of political child abuse.” Dr Sharie Coombes, a child and family psychotherapist, was a primary school headteacher when Palmer’s book came out, implementing early years policies which she said felt “misinformed, abusive and dangerous to children’s wellbeing, confidence and long-term learning attitudes”. “A decade on, I’m now a child and family psychotherapist helping to pick up the pieces of emotionally broken children forced to endure damaging, politically charged and excessively stressful learning environments and policies. “We cannot stand by and tolerate such abuses when we have other international models to draw on that demonstrate how to achieve excellent results and mentally healthy young people who value their education.”",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Protein hype: shoppers flushing money down the toilet, say experts", "content": "The UK’s rocketing demand for high-protein products is being fuelled by consumers buying foods unlikely to deliver the benefits they are seeking, experts have said. Weetabix, Shreddies, Mars, Snickers and Batchelors Cup a Soup were among the brands that launched enhanced protein versions this year as the trend hit the mainstream. Many supermarkets have introduced dedicated sections for higher-protein products and, according to Euromonitor, the market for sports protein products alone – which excludes most of the mainstream brands – is expected to hit £413m this year and almost £750m (in today’s money) in five years’ time. But experts have warned that consumers, particularly gym-goers, are falling victim to clever marketing. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Meat, fish and eggs. Experts say most people get enough protein through food. Photograph: grinvalds/Getty Images/iStockphoto Anna Daniels, a dietitian and British Dietetic Association spokeswoman, said: “People have a misconception they do need more protein whereas actually the majority of us are getting adequate protein – our requirements are quite low. If you’re an athlete you will have higher requirements but you can still get it from eggs, yoghurt, meat. The majority of us who go to the gym for an hour a couple of times a week, there’s no need to be having additional protein we [already] get from a balanced healthy diet.” Public Health England (PHE) guidelines suggest a protein intake for 19- to 64-year-olds of 55.5g for men and 45g for women, although experts say this will vary according to weight (the US Institute of Medicine stipulates a minimum of 0.8g per kg of body weight per day). The PHE guidelines equate to getting approximately 11% of the recommended number of calories from protein, whereas according to the National Diet and Nutrition survey, the actual figure for adults is 17% to 18%. Dr Alison Tedstone, PHE chief nutritionist, said: “The majority of people are consuming much more than the recommended daily allowance of protein through their everyday diet. So even if you hit the gym regularly, spending money on protein supplements is unlikely to bring any additional benefit.” According to the Euromonitor figures, which cover ready-to-drink beverages, protein powders and protein bars with a minimum of 20g of protein, the sports nutrition market has grown by about 160% since 2011. Another market analyst, Nielsen, said there was a 63% rise in sales of protein bars in 2015, compared with the previous 12 months, while Mintel figures, published in August, said there had been 40% more launches of high-protein products this year compared with 2015. Tom Sanders, professor emeritus of nutrition and dietetics at King’s College London, said people were being taken in by “nutri-babble”. “There’s been a lot of hype in gyms pushing high-protein shakes, there’s also a need to get rid of a waste product from the dairy industry, which is whey protein,” he said. “It’s a lot of crap, a way of selling a cheap product at a high price.” Danny Commane, a lecturer in nutritional science at the University of Reading, said while there was some evidence suggesting that eating more protein could help increase muscle mass, the fact that people were already eating so much more than they needed made supplements unnecessary. He has worked with the successful GB rowing team, some of whom he said do not take protein supplements despite consuming 6,000 calories a day. “It’s clever marketing,” said Commane. “Unless you’re doing extreme exercise or pursuing extreme lifestyle goals, you don’t need extra protein.” As excess protein is excreted through urine, people who are consuming too much are effectively flushing their money down the toilet, according to the experts. Unstoppable rise of protein: the trendy nutrient that's taking over menus Read more This also makes it unlikely that they are doing themselves harm – unless they already have kidney disease – but it could be problematic if high protein consumption replaces other foods important for good health such as fruit, vegetables and wholegrains, they said. “A lot of the products are high in sugar, low in fibre, they’re not healthy choices for consumers,” said Daniels. Darren Beale – founder of musclefood.com, which specialises in lean meats but also sells high-protein pizzas, chocolate and even beer – said gym-goers increasingly want to control what they put in their body. “Are people eating too much protein? Depends on their health or fitness goal,” he said. “There’s research showing that a diet high in protein can help build muscle mass, but there has to be a macro balance with carbs and fat. Our entire aim is to provide products which make it easier for customers to stick to their healthy eating plan.” None of the manufacturers of products mentioned in the article addressed the issue of the high amount of protein already in UK diets when contacted by the Guardian. A Food and Drink Federation spokesman said: “Food manufacturers are responding to an increasing demand from consumers for high-protein food and drinks, which can be consumed as part of a healthy lifestyle. There is also some evidence that foods high in proteins can help us feel full for longer – increasing satiety and aiding appetite control – and this may be helpful for people trying to balance their energy intake. Protein content will always be clearly labelled, usually alongside how much of an adult’s recommended intake this represents, to help consumers make informed choices.” A Mars spokeswoman said its bars were designed to be “a post-workout treat, to be enjoyed as part of a balanced diet”. Weetabix said protein at breakfast “helps regulate appetite and daily food intake”.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"What is productivity and why is the UK's so poor?", "content": "The shortfall in productivity compared with other developed economies has long been Britain’s economic achilles heel. It is a problem that Conservative and Labour chancellors have been grappling with for decades. Productivity is a guide to how good a country is at delivering the goods and services that are bought and sold. Technically, it is the rate of output per unit of input, measured per worker or by the number of hours worked. In layman’s terms, it is a measure of what goes in and what comes out. In some sectors, productivity is easy to measure. A factory that makes 1,000 cars a day with 50 workers is twice as productive as a factory that requires 100 workers to do the same job. In other parts of the economy, assessing whether productivity has improved is harder and less objective. At face value a fast-food joint that employed the same number of chefs to cook the same number of hamburgers as they did a year earlier would not be showing any increase in productivity. But if the quality of the hamburgers improved, that would be a productivity gain and statisticians would try to capture the improvement in the official figures. There are a number of ways in which a firm can make itself more productive. It can invest in new machinery that makes the production process more efficient. It can employ more highly skilled staff. It can train workers so that they can fully exploit the equipment they are using. It is through productivity improvements that living standards rise. For many years, the annual increase in productivity in the UK averaged around 2%, although there were periods when it was lower and periods when it was higher. Each year since the early 1990s, the Office for National Statistics has published an international comparison of productivity. This showed that UK productivity was 9% lower than the average of the other six members of the G7 (the US, Japan, Germany, France, Italy and Canada) but this gap narrowed to 4% by the time of the 2007 financial crisis. Since then, however, productivity in the UK has barely grown and the gap with the rest of the G7 has widened to 18%. The gap with Germany is 35% and with the US 30%. There have been a number of explanations for the dramatic deterioration in productivity: the availability of unskilled cheap labour has deterred firms from investment; the poor quality of UK roads, railways and broadband network; the shrinkage of the financial sector, which had been a source of high-productivity jobs in the boom before the 2007 crisis; and the misallocation of capital to “zombie” firms kept alive by ultra-low interest rates rather than to dynamic new enterprises. The government’s autumn statement document states that improving productivity is the “central long-term economic challenge” for the UK. Philip Hammond, the chancellor, has identified better infrastructure, technology and skills as the foundations for doing so, which is why he unveiled a new £23bn national productivity investment fund and backed Sir Charlie Mayfield’s productivity council in his autumn statement. But this is a goal that requires long-term investment and commitment.",diasaster:0},

The second half of the year saw more settled weather, especially in the south where a sequence of dry months lasted from July to October. Autumn was often fine with quiet “blocked” weather. The year as a whole was mild with rainfall close to average. Temperatures The provisional average Central England temperature was 10.4C, 0.4C above the 1981-2010 average. This is 1.2C above the average for the whole 357-year series. Regional temperature anomalies were similar except for East Anglia and South East England where the anomaly (from 1981-2010) was around 0.7C.

{ "title":"Queen uses Christmas message to urge Britons to 'take a deep breath'", "content": "The Queen has suggested that Britain needs to “take a deep breath” to face the “world’s big problems” after a tumultuous political year. In her annual Christmas message, the monarch made no mention of Britain’s historic vote to leave the European Union, focusing instead on the “inspiration” of Britain’s successful Olympics team. In what could be seen as a coded message to the nation in the aftermath of the Brexit vote, she said: “When people face a challenge they sometimes talk about taking a deep breath to find courage or strength. In fact, the word ‘inspire’ literally means ‘to breathe in’.” The Queen’s Christmas address was recorded before she fell ill, forcing her to miss the annual church service at Sandringham for the first time in almost 30 years. She had also delayed travelling to the royal estate for the annual Christmas break earlier this week. The Queen's speech in full: 'We can do small things with great love' Read more In the address, she added: “Even with the inspiration of others, it’s understandable that we sometimes think the world’s problems are so big that we can do little to help.” She partially echoed a Thought for the Day message given by the Prince of Wales earlier this week, in which he had called for more tolerance towards refugees by urging people to remember that Jesus, Mary and Joseph were forced to flee violent persecution. The Queen did not go that far, but in an address which traditionally has a strong religious theme, she pointed out that Jesus was “maligned and rejected by many, though he had done no wrong”. The Queen has done a Christmas broadcast every year of her 64-year reign except for 1969, when there was an overload of royal coverage due to her son’s investiture as Prince of Wales. Unlike the annual Queen’s speech to parliament, the Christmas address is written without the help of government advisers. The theme of this year’s broadcast was “inspiration”. She used the word “inspire” or its derivates 10 times as she spoke about the achievements of the UK’s Olympic and Paralympic athletes, and those from the Commonwealth. She added: “To be inspirational you don’t have to save lives or win medals. I often draw strength from meeting ordinary people doing extraordinary things: volunteers, carers, community organisers and good neighbours; unsung heroes whose quiet dedication makes them special.” This year’s message reflected the increasingly devout nature of the monarch’s Christmas addresses of the past few years. She repeatedly stressed the importance of “small acts of goodness” and she cited Mother, now Saint, Teresa of Calcutta, as saying: “Not all of us can do great things. But we can do small things with great love.” Using her own words, the Queen added: “Christ’s example helps me see the value of doing small things with great love, whoever does them and whatever they themselves believe.” She continued the theme in paying tribute to the 600 charities of which she is patron. “Many of these organisation are modest in size but inspire me with the work they do.” Last week it was announced that the Queen would be stepping down as patron from 25 national organisations at the end of her 90th birthday year, with the patronages passing to other members of the royal family. The Queen recorded her Christmas message in Buckingham Palace’s Regency Room while seated at a desk featuring a photograph of her with the Prince of Wales, released earlier this month to mark the end of her 90th birthday year.

More than a thousand people had gathered outside the Norfolk church for a glimpse of the monarch, including some who had arrived before dawn. In a brief statement issued before the service, Buckingham Palace said: “The Queen continues to recover from a heavy cold and will stay indoors to assist with her recovery.” It added: “Her Majesty will participate in the royal family Christmas celebrations during the day.” The 90-year-old Queen and Duke of Edinburgh, 95, were forced to fly to their Sandringham estate in Norfolk by helicopter on Thursday after their initial Christmas plans to travel by train were cancelled because of ill health.

But what makes it a show for “highly sophisticated” grown-ups? What is sophisticated about “a tsunami of smut” being unable to get beyond crude lavatory “humour” and taking over that most quintessential of Christmas family entertainments to which we all used to be able to go with our children, parents and grandparents, knowing everyone would be able to enjoy it – the pantomime? I’m no prude, but I am sick to death of gimcrack TV “celebs” being allowed, even encouraged, irresponsibly to hijack our children’s airwaves, screens and stages. Why can’t we allow children to be children? I want my young grandchildren to enjoy with me the sheer fun of panto, the outrageous costumes, stock characters, dancing and singing, spectacular scenery, audience interaction, jokes – both scripted and visual – they can understand and paper-thin plots. The historic stylised cross-dressing of dames and principal boy is comedy: children of all genders dress up, cross-dress, enjoy it when adults do so too, and love and laugh at extravagant exaggeration. Quality pantomime can be wonderful. But what you describe is something quite other and, I would suggest, even sinister in the way it has doused what used to be all-age family entertainment with ill-disguised ordure.

But it is not uncommon for the weather to bring serious disruption. “It’s when there’s most energy in the atmosphere with the sun almost overhead, and the continent really heats up,” explains Andy Casely, a risk analyst working for Willis Towers Watson in Sydney. Heatwaves are a worry, and evidence suggests that climate change is making Australian heatwaves hotter, longer and more frequent. During the summer of 2012 to 2013 the “Angry Summer” heatwave broke hundreds of weather records, including the hottest day ever for Australia (averaging 40.3°C across the entire continent) and seven days in a row when the continent averaged over 39°C. And with that heat the risk of bushfires often increases too. In December 2015 soaring temperatures led to dramatic Christmas Day bushfires breaking out on the Great Ocean Road, about 160km southwest of Melbourne. One-hundred and sixteen homes were destroyed and 2,200 hectares of land were burned. Sometimes the excess atmospheric energy is channelled into dramatic storms, like the 2011 Christmas Day storm, which deposited hailstones the size of tennis balls over Melbourne, and caused flash-flooding, power cuts and over A$700m damage. For the northern half of the country cyclones are a concern: Broome was drenched by ex-tropical cyclone Yvette over the week. Back in 1974 the city of Darwin in the Northern Territory was devastated by cyclone Tracy on Christmas Eve. Seventy-one people were killed and over 70% of Darwin’s buildings were destroyed, leaving around 41,000 people homeless. Today improved building standards mean that a Tracy equivalent would be unlikely to cause the same devastation.",diasaster:0},

The Tupolev Tu-154 plane was carrying musicians from the famous Alexandrov military choir, as well as dancers, musicians and journalists, to a new year concert for troops in Syria. It crashed soon after taking off from the resort of Sochi on Sunday. In a statement, the Kremlin said that Putin expressed his “deepest condolences to the families and friends of those killed in the crash”. He also ordered the prime minister, Dmitry Medvedev, to form a state commission to investigate the crash. It will determine whether safety breaches led to the crash. Russian agencies said all possible reasons for the crash were being examined, but investigators believed terrorism was unlikely. Russia’s RIA news agency, citing an unidentified security source, said preliminary data indicated the plane had crashed because of a technical malfunction, Reuters reported. A total of 84 passengers and eight crew were on board when the plane dropped off radar shortly after take-off at 5.40am local time (0240 GMT) from Adler airport in Sochi, southern Russia. The plane had stopped off at Adler en route from Moscow to Syria.

An unnamed ministry source told Russian news agencies that those on board had almost no chance of surviving and that no life-rafts had been found. Interfax cited another unnamed source as saying the plane had not sent an SOS signal. The Russian defence ministry added on Sunday that rescuers had said there was no sign of any survivors of the crash. Defence ministry spokesman Maj Gen Igor Konashenkov said “no survivors are seen” at the crash site, less than a mile from the shore. sochi Those on board included Russian service personnel and artists from the Russian military’s official choir, the Alexandrov Ensemble, who were on their way to celebrate New Year’s Eve with air force personnel at the Khmeimim airbase near Latakia in western Syria, the defence source told RIA. Konashenkov said nine Russian reporters had also been on board, as well as military service personnel. The journalists were from state-controlled NTV and First Channel, as well as the army’s channel Zvezda. “The search operation is continuing,” said Konashenkov. “Four ships, five helicopters and a drone are working in the area,” he said, saying a military commission had flown to Sochi to look into what happened. The Interfax news agency cited an unnamed source in the emergency services as saying about six bodies had already been recovered from the sea. More than 3,000 people, including around 100 divers flown in from across Russia, were working through the night on Sunday to search the crash site, the Defense Ministry said. According to the defence ministry’s list of passengers, Elizaveta Glinka, a member of Putin’s advisory human rights council, was on the plane. Known as Doctor Liza, she was a well-known public figure who had run a major humanitarian effort on the separatist side of the lines during the recent war in east Ukraine.

In April 2010, many high-ranking Polish officials, including then president Lech Kaczyński, were killed when a Tu-154 airliner went down in thick fog while approaching Smolensk airport in western Russia. The plane, which was widely used during the Soviet period, has been taken out of commission by many Russian airlines in recent years, but is still used by the military. They have flown journalists and other civilians to the Russian military base in Syria in recent months.

{ "title":"How do liberals halt the march of the right? Stand our ground and toughen up", "content": "To all you despondent liberals, Labour centrists, Tory modernisers, remainers, social justice warriors, social justice worriers, and everyone out there fretful about Brexit, depressed by Donald Trump, and scared of the alt-right, here is my festive message: get off the ground, you wusses. Put down your gingerbread lattes, and put up your dukes. Let us consult the wisdom of Sean Connery’s Malone in The Untouchables, and adapt it to our times. You want to get the alt-right? Here’s how you get them. They pull a knife, you pull a gun. They send one of yours to the hospital, you send one of theirs to the morgue. That’s the Chicago way. Before we proceed, and to pre-empt litigation, let me emphasise that I am speaking metaphorically. If you were by any chance planning to mark Boxing Day by going after a member of the far right with a pointed stick, please don’t. Being against the law, it will only complicate matters. It is also likely to give you indigestion after all those turkey sandwiches. Stand up for integration: present it as an opportunity not a burden Still, in every other respect, it really is time to stop sobbing and toughen up. So here are my 10 tips for liberals of all kinds hoping to stop the march of the right in 2017: Defend your ground, aggressively Pluralism, women’s equality, ethnic diversity, our responsibility to refugees, internationalism, LGBT rights – all that is now under systematic attack. It won’t defend itself. One of the enduring lessons of Bill Clinton’s campaigns is that rapid rebuttal works. When idiots post idiocy on social media, call them out. Challenge, probe, demand answers. Be civil, but unrelenting. Never cringe or yield ground to bigots. Facts defeat fury, sooner or later. Colonise your opponents’ language The Brexiteers, alt-right and Breitbart gang have been expert in their vocabulary. “Take back control” was a great campaign slogan. But what does “control” mean to the mother of three whose pay is lagging behind inflation? Or to the 55-year-old man suddenly made redundant because his employer is relocating to the continent? Or to the restaurateur no longer able to hire migrant labour? And why is centrist speech dismissed as “virtue signalling” while fiercely rightwing language is hailed as “plain speaking”? As for “liberal elite”, that has come to mean little more that “people in London I don’t like”. Again, point this out. You’ll find that the most sensitive “snowflake” of the lot is an alt-right tweeter called upon to define his terms. Lead, don’t follow Treat opinion polls as no more than partial snapshots of opinion rather than flawless oracles. Use social media to explain, correct errors and confront folly – not to people-please. Indeed, distrust those who invoke “the people”. There is no British Volk – one of the finest features of these heterogeneous islands. Heed grievances – but don’t appease Acknowledge and respect the “left-behind” – and not just angry whites. It is plainly unjust that, too often, globalisation involves paying the rich even more and the poor even less. There won’t be much mass consumerism if consumers can’t afford food and shelter. But don’t give an inch to the protectionists and the border-closers. The greatest challenge to future employment – and not just the blue-collar variety – is automation. It is also an opportunity. Theresa May’s government promises an “industrial strategy” that harmonises technology, education and job creation. Hold the prime minister to account. Stand up for immigration Not just as an economic necessity but as a cultural good. If there is such a thing as “Britishness”, it has cordial multiplicity at its heart. Stamp on the economically illiterate idea that immigration is a zero-sum game, and that newcomers are depriving Britons of work, housing, school places and healthcare. The NHS and social care system already employs 130,000 EU citizens. The service industry would collapse without migrant labour. Do not tolerate the infantile misrepresentation of “immigration” as the cause of every evil. Demand maturity in public discourse. Be relentless. Stand up for integration Don’t confuse liberalism with relativism. Present integration as an opportunity, not a burden. Insist upon adequate resources for English teaching. Respect and celebrate difference, but define a core of legal duties, social responsibilities and cultural norms to which all must adhere. Never let the claims of faith trump the promotion of equality – especially of women. If your prime objective is not to cause offence, don’t bother. Breitbart: how 'Trump Pravda' muddied the waters and surfed wave Read more Fight the next battle, not the last Successful politics requires an unsentimental readiness to identify the problems of today, not yesterday. Margaret Thatcher fought inflation, union power and Soviet communism. Tony Blair sought to combine economic efficiency with social justice. In 2017, the challenges are no less specific: globalisation (opportunities and discontents); Islamist and far-right extremism; the cult of autocracy fuelled by populism; climate change; the consequences of human longevity. Be uncompromising in your focus. Don’t let the other side frame the debate. Don’t make a fetish of “unity” The lesson of 2016 is that you are in a fight, and you lost the first round. This is not the moment for vague “One Nation” rhetoric. It’s a time of political combat – whether you like it or not. Resist kneejerk reaction, but don’t be afraid to take sides. Define your red lines and patrol them assiduously. This is the biggest political scrap since the cold war: autocracy versus democratic institutions; liberalism versus traditionalism; wall-building versus openness. The alt-right, Ukip and Breitbart understand that. Do you? Challenge the public Churchill, Kennedy, Mandela: part of greatness is a readiness to demand “blood, toil, tears and sweat”. Remember Benjamin Franklin’s answer to the woman who asked what kind of government was on offer: “A republic – if you can keep it.” Voters don’t resent patriotic and civic demands. But they do punish lazy promises (£350m extra a week for the NHS? Trump’s pledge to reopen coal mines?) Have the courage to declare that worthwhile solutions are never easy. Be patient It’s bound to be a long haul. There will be setbacks along the way. But – if you hold your nerve – the far-right revolution will be revealed for the fraud that it is. So get some rest in Christmas week. Go back to your sitting rooms – and prepare for Sherlock. Then resume the fight. To adapt the distinction beloved by the Brexiteers, soft liberalism just doesn’t cut it any more. Time to try the hard variety.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Afghanistan funds abusive militias as US military 'ignores' situation, officials say", "content": "The US military and the CIA are turning a blind eye as Afghanistan’s spy agency spends foreign donor money on militias which are committing human rights abuses that help destabilise the fragile country, according to local and western officials. The Afghan national directorate of security (NDS) arms strongmen ostensibly to fight the Taliban and other militants. But some militia leaders use their new power to fight local turf wars, including against elected government officials, rather than insurgents. One such commander, Perim Qul, in the northern province of Takhar, has received about $85,000 (£70,000) to arm 500 men. However, he allegedly spends part of that money on a private prison where he beats and extorts local people. His men have even ambushed and killed a local politician. One evening in July, Perim Qul’s men detained a man named Najib as he was relaxing outside the hotel he owns. After several days’ beating, Najib said he would acquiesce to their demands for cash and asked for a phone to request the $3,000 they demanded. Instead, he called police, who rescued him. Najib sent photos of his bruised back and legs to the provincial prosecutor, and got one of his tormentors arrested. “I have no enmity with Perim Qul. I am just a simple hotel owner,” Najib said. That kind of justice, though minor, is rare in Rustaq district. Qul, a 55-year-old war veteran with no official title, has been running Rustaq like a fiefdom for over a decade. Local residents say he has opposed any attempt – including by the government – to assert authority there. To pay his men, he allegedly coerces civilians. So when the Afghan government last year approved Qul’s request to enrol in its anti-Taliban militia program, many local people were concerned. Hundreds protested outside the district government building. Contemporary western security reports obtained by the Guardian warned that reinforcing Qul’s militia could add to violence, crime and territorial rivalries. Afghanistan's warlord vice-president spoiling for a fight with the Taliban Read more Qul got money for 500 men. In reality, police officials believe, he commands up to 1,500. Meanwhile, there are only 35 national police officers to maintain security in the entire district, said Gulistan Samadi, a former district police chief. “I don’t believe in these uprising groups. They are irresponsible. They don’t care about the government,” Samadi said. “They are kidnappers, robbers and killers. They are worse than the Taliban.” Shortly after Qul received the spy agency money, his men ambushed a vehicle carrying a local rival, the provincial council member Aynuddin Rustaqi, killed one bodyguard and abducted him. Rustaqi was eventually released, but a few months later, he was less fortunate. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Afghan militia men raise their weapons as they stand guard in the Achin district of Nangarhar province east of Kabul, Afghanistan. The NDS arms groups in opposition to the Taliban and other militants. Photograph: Mohammad Anwar Danishyar/AP In April, an argument between the politician and the strongman turned violent, according to witnesses and western security analysts. After two militia members were killed, Rustaqi found himself surrounded in the local government headquarters by 200 armed men. During a more than two-hour standoff, no government forces intervened, and Rustaqi was eventually killed alongside three supporters and another person. “The government can’t stop them because they don’t have the force,” said Najib, the hotel owner. Rustaqi was a vocal critic of the government’s arming of irregular militias. His son said he was a victim of nothing more than a brutal show of force. “For 13 years Perim Qul has tried to run for provincial council, but he doesn’t have public support. Now, he has a lot of armed men,” said Ahmad Jawad, the son. In an interview, Perim Qul admitted that his chief enemy was not the Taliban, whom he was paid to fight. It was the local governing political party. “We will fight alongside any group to get rid of the oppression of Jamiat,” he said, referring to the Tajik-majority party in the north, which he says discriminates against people of other ethnicities. “We don’t care if it’s Taliban or Isis. If anyone throws a stone at our enemy, we will fight with them.” Qul said he was not out to unseat the government. “If the government provides security and asks us to put down our weapons, we will disarm,” he said. 'My grandsons' fight to avenge their father': child soldiers in Afghanistan Read more The People’s Uprising program is reminiscent of a controversial local police scheme, ALP, initially introduced by the US military to build village-level resistance to the Taliban and help foreign forces withdraw from Afghanistan. However, the ALP has been widely criticised for employing child soldiers, abusive behaviour, and creating fertile ground for armed opposition such as the Taliban. While the US does not directly support People’s Uprising groups, the militias are bankrolled by the National Directorate of Security – and the bulk of NDS funding is believed to come from the CIA. In the past, the CIA has run paramilitary Afghan units responsible for killing civilians. More recently, the Washington Post has reported that the CIA also funds and operates alongside ruthless militias in the Afghan east. A spokesman for the CIA refused to comment. The Afghan government said it worked “with a lot of precaution” when supporting People’s Uprising groups. It insisted that the program had been “effective in most of the cases”, said Haroon Chakhansuri, a presidential spokesman. The NDS officially declined to comment, but a local NDS official in Takhar province said the allegations against Perim Qul in this article were founded. While the US military said it did not fund the Afghan intelligence agency, it did support the army and police, whose jobs become more difficult when violence flares up. Yet, international forces claim to not discuss the militia program with the Afghan government. “It’s just not a topic we’re engaging the government on,” said Charles H Cleveland, the international coalition’s spokesman. “It’s a sovereign nation; they make sovereign decisions.” Cleveland did not see militia leaders like Qul undermining security. “I have not seen any hard facts to support what you’re saying,” he said. “But I’ll grant you, you can go anywhere in Afghanistan and find almost anything.” However, an informed coalition staff member said the US military was fully aware of Perim Qul’s activities but turned a blind eye, perhaps because the regular Afghan forces were stretched so thin they depended on vigilante militias. “They are not ignoring it out of ignorance. They are ignoring it with intent,” he said. The same reasoning might apply to the Afghan government, which is mired in political crisis and a long-running war. As one western official put it: “While the government is busy in Kabul, Perim Qul is carving out his own little empire.”",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Israel summons ambassadors for dressing down over UN resolution", "content": "Benjamin Netanyahu has summoned the ambassadors of all UN security council members which backed a resolution condemning Israeli settlements to “personally reprimand” them. According to Israeli media reports the ambassadors summoned on Sunday for the Israeli prime minister’s dressing down include all those from security council members with permanent missions in Israel: Russia, China, Japan, Ukraine, France, Britain, Angola, Egypt, Uruguay and Spain. Israel rejects 'shameful' UN resolution amid criticism of Netanyahu Read more The resolution, which passed on Friday with 14 votes in support and only the US abstaining, condemned Jewish settlements in the occupied Palestinian territories as constituting a flagrant violation of international law. It also demanded that states “distinguish, in their relevant dealings, between the territory of the state of Israel and the territories occupied since 1967”. Netanyahu also accused the US president, Barack Obama, of directly coordinating the resolution at the morning cabinet meeting. “We have no doubt that the Obama administration initiated it, stood behind it, coordinated its versions and insisted upon its passage,” he said. Washington has denied this. The rebuke came as Israel continued to retaliate against countries that supported the motion, cutting aid to Senegal, cancelling forthcoming official visits – including by the Ukrainian prime minister – and recalling two of its ambassadors. Netanyahu also ordered the Israeli foreign ministry to “re-evaluate all of our ties to the UN within a month”. Netanyahu is under renewed political pressure to bring forward controversial legislation to legalise dozens of currently illegal outposts in the occupied Palestinian territories. Significantly, the US ambassador was not summoned, despite the Obama administration’s decision not to veto the resolution – an abstention described by Netanyahu as an “underhanded and anti-Israel manoeuvre”. Later on Sunday, however, the US state department said its ambassador would meet the Israeli prime minister. “We can confirm Ambassador Shapiro will meet with PM Netanyahu this evening,” the state department said in a brief statement to Agence France-Presse. A senior diplomat quoted by the Haaretz newspaper suggested irritation in the diplomatic community with Netanyahu’s Christmas Day summons. “What would they have said in Jerusalem if we summoned the Israeli ambassador on Yom Kippur?” the diplomat told the paper. The ambassadors’ dressing-down comes amid mounting criticism of Netanyahu from Israeli politicians and the media. Some prominent columnists have blamed Netanyahu’s poor relationship with Obama and his prioritisation of Jewish settlers for the UN resolution. Israel has continued to condemn Obama and Friday’s resolution, which demanded a halt to settlements in Palestinian territory – the first UN resolution since 1979 to condemn Israel over its settlement policy. By deciding not to use its veto, the US deeply angered Israel, which has accused Obama of abandoning its closest Middle East ally in the waning days of his administration. The text was passed with support from all other members of the 15-member security council. Applause broke out in the chamber when the vote results were read out. The landmark vote came despite intense lobbying by Israel and calls from the US president-elect, Donald Trump, to block the text. While the resolution contains no sanctions, Israeli officials are concerned it could widen the possibility of prosecution at the international criminal court. They are also worried it could encourage some countries to impose sanctions against Israeli settlers and goods produced in the settlements. Netanyahu called the resolution a “shameful blow against Israel at the United Nations”. “The decision that was taken was biased and shameful, but we will withstand it,” the Israeli leader said on Saturday evening. “It will take time, but this decision will be annulled.” Singling out New Zealand and Senegal, he added: “Two countries with which we have diplomatic relations co-sponsored the resolution against us at the UN; therefore, I ordered yesterday that our ambassadors be recalled from Senegal and from New Zealand. I have ordered that all Israeli assistance to Senegal be halted, and there’s more to come. “Those who work with us will benefit because Israel has much to give to the countries of the world. But those who work against us will lose – because there will be a diplomatic and economic price for their actions against Israel.” Netanyahu said Obama had broken a longstanding US commitment not to “dictate the terms of peace to Israel” at the UN. The resolution, Netanyahu said, was “part of the swansong of the old world that is biased against Israel, but, my friends, we are entering a new era”, referring to Trump’s imminent presidency. Trump reacted after the vote by promising change at the UN. “As to the UN, things will be different after Jan 20th,” he tweeted, referring to the date of his inauguration. “The big loss yesterday for Israel in the United Nations will make it much harder to negotiate peace. Too bad, but we will get it done anyway!” Trump tweeted later. The US has traditionally served as Israel’s diplomatic shield, protecting it from resolutions that Israel opposes. It is Israel’s most important ally, providing it with more than $3bn (£3.1bn) a year in defence aid. That number will soon rise to $3.8bn per year under a new decade-long pact – the biggest pledge of US military aid in history. The Obama administration has grown increasingly frustrated with settlement building in the West Bank, which Israel has occupied for nearly 50 years. There have been growing warnings that settlement expansion is fast eroding the possibility of a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the basis of years of negotiations. Settlements are built on land the Palestinians view as part of their future state and seen as illegal under international law. “We cannot stand in the way of this resolution as we seek to preserve a chance of attaining our longstanding objective of two states living side by side in peace and security,” said Samantha Power, the US ambassador to the UN. “The settlement problem has gotten so much worse that it is now putting at risk the very viability of that two-state solution.” After the vote, Israel’s justice minister, Ayelet Shaked, of the far-right Jewish Home said Israel needed “to talk about annexation” of the West Bank. About 430,000 Israeli settlers currently live in the West Bank, and a further 200,000 Israelis live in annexed East Jerusalem, which Palestinians see as the capital of their future state.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Satire won’t rid us of Trump, but it will make us feel better", "content": "The world’s natural resources may be at risk of depletion, but there’s one that’s still plentiful and has never been more vital: humour. Not the laughter that provides a temporary escape from the nastiness of the present, welcome though that is. No, the kind I’m talking about is humour that skewers the lies, boasts and taunts of those who claim to have “won”. Beleaguered people have long understood the significant political role that humour can play. Earlier this month the New York Times posted a video of comedians living in repressive regimes around the world advising Americans – oh bittersweet reversal! – on how to survive the next four years. In eastern Europe before the fall of the Berlin Wall, satire was one of the few channels through which dissent could escape the censor, by using political propaganda to undermine itself. As in the joke about the Russian applying for an exit visa who is summoned to explain why. “Isn’t your salary good enough?” “No, I can’t complain.” “Isn’t your flat big enough?” “No, I can’t complain.” “So why do you want to leave?” “Because I can’t complain.” After Henry Kissinger won the Nobel peace prize in 1973, the American humourist Tom Lehrer said satire was obsolete Laughing at powerful elites makes them seem less omnipotent. It punctures their self-importance and makes us feel less alone. But subversive though comedy can be, let’s not delude ourselves that it’s a path to regime change – just remember Peter Cook’s biting remark about the satirical Berlin cabarets of the 1930s, which did so much to stop the rise of Hitler. The same could be said of the US TV show Saturday Night Live’s weekly roasting of Donald Trump. Last week they had Breaking Bad’s Walter White (Bryan Cranston), ace crystal meth maker, appointed head of the Drug Enforcement Agency. His motto? “Make America cook again.” Humour is not a complete answer. Is it still possible to lampoon Trump, for example? After Henry Kissinger (responsible for the illegal carpet-bombing of Cambodia) was awarded the Nobel peace prize in 1973, the American humourist Tom Lehrer said satire was obsolete. With Trump it’s been argued that it’s hard to outdo a narcissist who’s a parody of himself. Worse, impersonations run the risk of rendering the Trumps of this world harmless objects of mirth; they might even act as a safety valve. On the other hand, Trump himself is notoriously thin-skinned, tweeting about how unfunny Alec Baldwin’s representation of him is on SNL. (Oh no, president-elect: that at least isn’t your call.) In his early days of campaigning, Trump demonstrated some flair for entertaining repartee (his sense of timing was always good), but this soon faded, replaced by today’s demented tweeter. Never trust a man who over-uses exclamation marks: he’s not being witty, he’s just using punctuation to shout. Some aspects of human experience lie beyond humour. Any jokes about Aleppo would need to be as savage as the events unfolding there. Attempts to bring humour to bear on the Holocaust have also proved ghastly, whether well-intentioned (Roberto Benigni’s hideously feel-good 1997 Italian “comic” movie Life Is Beautiful, about a Nazi concentration camp) or ill (the skit on the liberation of Auschwitz by the French comedian Dieudonné, in his 2012 film L’antisémite, in which he dabs his neck with liquid from a Zyklon B gas canister). Donald Trump will violate the US constitution on inauguration day | Laurence H Tribe Read more The left has often been caricatured as humourless, often by those passive-aggressive types whose refrain is “can’t you take a joke?” (To which the proper response is “Yes, if it’s funny.”) The best humour isn’t agit-quip but more nuanced and self-deprecating. One of comedian Nish Kumar’s most perceptive jokes at a recent show was about gentrification involving white people moving into areas where minorities previously lived. “It’s a double edged sword for me, given my parents are Indian and middle-class,” he said. “Gentrification is essentially the replacement of people I’m related to by people I went to university with.” But political humour isn’t just the preserve of professional comedians; the internet has uncovered a huge army of wits. Who knew so many ordinary people were so funny? When a grinning Trump was photographed last month having dinner with Mitt Romney, who called him a “phoney” during the campaign, social media went wild with witty captions and Photoshopped jokes. They won’t make Trump disappear, but they can still be an essential weapon against bigotry and prejudice. And all such weapons seem essential now.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Will Spotify kill the music download?", "content": "The digital download, ushered in to the mass market more than a decade ago by Apple’s iTunes music store, is in rapid decline as people shift to streaming services such as Spotify and Apple Music. The shift from downloads to streaming is highlighted by the biggest-selling singles of this year and 2006, when Gnarls Barkley’s Crazy became the first download-only song to top the UK charts, in a sign the digital format was eclipsing CD sales. Crazy shifted nearly 661,000 units during its nine weeks at UK No 1 and went on to sell more than 1m downloads. This summer, Drake’s One Dance matched the record achieved by Wet Wet Wet’s Love Is All Around for 15 weeks at No 1 in the UK singles chart – which now combines download, physical and streaming equivalent sales. By the end of September, it had racked up 1.695m sales, including nearly 505,000 downloads and a whopping 119m streams. Streaming’s advantages are that you can listen to any of millions of tracks whenever you like, and create playlists; paying subscribers can also download individual tracks for offline listening. The disadvantage: if you stop paying the monthly stipend of about £10, the access, playlists and downloads evaporate. By contrast, a purchased download lasts forever – but it’s the only thing you can listen to. The people who embraced downloading, started in 2003 by Apple’s iTunes music store, were the tech-savvy types who shifted easily over to streaming. Thus the download is in rapid decline – so much so that at the end of November, the value of sales in the old vinyl format surpassed those of digital in the UK over a week, by £2.4m to £2.1m. At about £20 an album, vinyl sold about 120,000 units, against the equivalent of 2.6m digital tracks costing 79p. But look more closely and the gap isn’t that big: at 10 songs per album, digital downloads were only the equivalent of 260,000 albums. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Streaming songs is becoming ever more popular with music fans. Photograph: PR So how much longer do downloads have? A few years and they’re dead, says Mark Mulligan, music analyst at Midia Consulting: “It’s going to die before the CD. The CD has a fairly universal player, where there’s always at least one in a house. And the people who grew up buying CDs are the older music consumers – the CD will literally die out only when they do.” Downloads outsold physical formats for the first time in the UK in 2011, when streaming services were in their infancy. But even by 2014 they were falling, from £397.3m the previous year to £338.1m, while streaming grew to £175m. That trend is continuing. Apple still controls the digital download market, with about 65% to 70% of the total, says Mulligan: he suggests that the death knell for downloads will come with a redesign of the iTunes app interface that de-emphasises downloads in favour of the Music subscription streaming service. “Last year downloads declined by 16% in nominal terms,” he says. “This year they are tracking to decline by between 25% and 30%.” The growth of revenue from streaming services since 2011 The growth of revenue from streaming services since 2011 By 2019 the business could be worth just $600m (£485m) globally, compared with a high of $3.9bn in 2012; by 2020, Apple might decide that the download business isn’t worth troubling with, and make the iTunes store effectively invisible, Mulligan suggests. “The narrative of services-based music would be complete.” Apple, however, resists the suggestion that it’s about to turn off the download tap. “There’s no end date … our music iTunes business is doing very well,” Eddy Cue, Apple’s senior vice-president of internet software and services, told Billboard magazine in June, on the first anniversary of the Music subscription service. “Downloads weren’t growing, and certainly are not going to grow again, but it’s not declining anywhere near as fast as any of them [in record labels] predicted. There are a lot of people who download music and are happy with it and they’re not moving towards subscriptions.” Cue recently said that 60% of people using Apple Music had not bought content from the iTunes music store in the past 12 months, suggesting they were either “lapsed” downloaders, or never were. That makes their monthly revenues all gravy for the music industry, he said. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Photograph: Graeme Robertson for the Guardian Certainly the good news for labels and musicians is that the streaming services are attracting growing numbers of subscribers, paying monthly fees of up to £10: Spotify has 40 million, and Apple recently said it has passed 20 million. Smaller services such as Deezer and Tidal have a few million between them. However, the music industry, which has fretted that each shift in music format since 1995, from MP3 piracy to downloads to streaming, is driving down revenues, is now so worried about the effect of YouTube on streaming revenues that the US labels tried to push streaming payments on to the agenda of Donald Trump’s “tech summit” in mid-December, when representatives of Apple, Google, Microsoft and others met the US president-elect. What the RIAA, which represents US labels, was complaining about is known in the industry as the “value gap” – the difference in effective per-play payments between audio services such as Spotify, and YouTube. YouTube, though, remains the world’s biggest venue for music streaming, with millions of videos that can be combined into playlists. Hook your phone or computer up to a speaker, and it’s just like Spotify: you’ll get the music, and the audio from any video ads, and then can pick and choose from a huge catalogue. Though the latest figures only cover the first half of 2015, the monitoring service Nielsen reckons that YouTube delivered 60% more music streams than all the on-demand music streaming services combined – and that the gap had grown since the same period in 2014. The arrival of Apple Music in June 2015 might shift that, but it’s unlikely. What riles the music business is that the amount that YouTube pays it per track played works out as substantially less than Spotify or Apple Music. Whereas the latter two services have complex agreements with the record labels setting a per-play fee, YouTube pays out a share of the ad revenue that any track identified as belonging to a company earns. That tends to be lower than a per-track fee, because advertising prices and value varies enormously. Mulligan says: “Video consumption went through the roof in 2015, but there weren’t enough ads to put against it – so the ad revenues paid grew more slowly than consumption.” Hence the RIAA’s push to get streaming payments on to Trump’s mind at the tech summit. It’s unclear whether it succeeded. YouTube says the ad-funded model has transformed the music video from a costly promotional tool into a new source of revenue. “In the last 12 months, we’ve paid out $1bn to the music industry in ad revenues alone, and are working collaboratively with them to bring more money to artists,” it says. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Vinyls are back in vogue Photograph: Michael Bowles/Rex/Shutterstock This doesn’t sit comfortably with the music industry. David Price, director of insight at the IFPI, the global trade body for the recording industry, says: “We don’t believe YouTube is properly rewarding artists for the huge consumption that’s going on there. But in the last year we have seen the EU take positive steps towards creating a better and fairer licensing environment in Europe.” The BPI, the UK music industry’s trade body, complained in May that artists earn less from YouTube than they do from vinyl. But in the long run, streaming is the only game in town – along, perhaps, with the CD and vinyl. The download once looked like the future; now, the question is how much more of a future it has.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Showmen’s Guild plays vital role for travelling fairs", "content": "The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) seems to be on another planet in its allegations against the Showmen’s Guild of Great Britain (Watchdog: unfair trade body could be stifling competition, 22 December). Its provisional findings would appear to have been reached without any serious consideration of the history of fairs in this country and the environment in which travelling showmen operate. How many fairs did they actually visit during their deliberations – or were they all conducted in splendid, ideologically bound isolation? Their conclusions certainly do not bear any relationship to reality on the fairground. Contrary to their suggestion, there is always pressure “to provide different or new attractions” – and it comes from the fairgoers, who from time immemorial have always looked for novelty at the annual fair. The travelling showman is acutely aware of this and has always sought to satisfy this demand. But he can only reinvest in his business if he has the sort of security and stability that the 127-year-old Showmen’s Guild has been able to offer its members through its regulations. These regulations, it should be said, are democratically agreed by its members and have always been subject to revision in light of changing economic and social circumstances. In addition to the benefits conferred on its own members, the guild also provides organisations such as local authorities (and ultimately all fairgoers) with the assurance that its members comply with more socially important considerations including strict fairground safety requirements. Some of the guild’s regulations the CMA criticises were actually introduced to bring greater order to the fairground industry at a time when unfettered competition was resulting in unseemly incidents that were a credit to no one. The rules of the Showmen’s Guild have a strong, ethical basis: a fact that is due in large measure to the influence of its first full-time general secretary, the Reverend Thomas Horne, a clergyman who had long campaigned on the showmen’s behalf. Perhaps the CMA should reveal why they have conducted this presumably costly exercise in chasing imaginary butterflies?

{ "title":"Pope calls for peace in world's conflict areas in Christmas Day message", "content": "The world must harness the power of love rather than might and wealth to bring peace to areas blighted by conflict, Pope Francis has said in his Christmas Day message. In the UK, Christian leaders focused on uncertainty, anxiety and fear at the end of a tumultuous year on the global stage. In his Christmas Day homily delivered in front of thousands of people from the balcony of St Peter’s Basilica in Rome, the leader of the world’s 1.2 billion Roman Catholics appealed for the message of peace to go out “to the ends of the Earth to reach all peoples, especially those scarred by war and harsh conflicts that seem stronger than the yearning for peace”. At the close of a year that has seen repeated acts of terrorism – and amid tight security around the Vatican – Francis wished peace “to those who have lost a person dear to them as a result of brutal acts of terrorism, and to those who have sown fear and death into the hearts of so many countries and cities”. Syria topped the pope’s long checklist of countries that have been plagued by war and suffering over the past year. “Far too much blood has been spilled,” he said. The pontiff added: “Above all, in the city of Aleppo, site of the most awful battles in recent weeks, it is most urgent that assistance and support be guaranteed to the exhausted civil populace, with respect for humanitarian law. It is time for weapons to be stilled forever, and the international community to actively seek a negotiated solution so that civil coexistence can be restored in the country.” 'I couldn't take anything except dignity': stories of the leaving of Aleppo Read more He called on Israelis and Palestinians to “have the courage and the determination to write a new page of history, where hate and revenge give way to the will to build together a future of mutual understanding and harmony”. The pope called for peace, unity and dialogue in Iraq, Libya, Yemen, Nigeria, South Sudan and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. There was an “urgent need to put into practice commitments” made in eastern Ukraine, he added. He urged harmony in Colombia, “which seeks to embark on a new and courageous path of dialogue and reconciliation”, and courage for Venezuela “to undertake the necessary steps to put an end to current tensions”. Turning to Asia, he spoke of the need for protection and humanitarian assistance in Myanmar, and the need for “a renewed spirit of cooperation” to overcome tensions on the Korean peninsula. The pope also sent a message of peace to “our abandoned and excluded brothers and sisters, to those that suffer hunger and to all the victims of violence. Peace to exiles, migrants and refugees, to all those who in our day are subject to human trafficking. Pope Francis: Christmas has been ‘taken hostage’ by materialism Read more “Peace to the people who suffer because of the economic ambitions of the few, because of the sheer greed and the idolatry of money, which leads to slavery. Peace to those affected by social and economic unrest, and to those who endure the consequences of earthquakes or other natural catastrophes.” Children got a special mention, “above all those deprived of the joys of childhood because of hunger, wars or the selfishness of adults”. Earlier, in his Christmas Eve homily, Francis said that Christmas had been “taken hostage” by a dazzling materialism that blinded many to the needs of the hungry, the migrants and the war-weary. A world often obsessed with gifts, feasting and self-centredness needed more humility. “If we want to celebrate Christmas authentically, we need to contemplate this sign: the fragile simplicity of a small newborn, the meekness of where he lies, the tender affection of the swaddling clothes. God is there,” the pontiff said. Many in the wealthy world had to be reminded that the message of Christmas was humility, simplicity and mystery. “Jesus was born rejected by some and regarded by many others with indifference,” he said. “Today, also the same indifference can exist, when Christmas becomes a feast where the protagonists are ourselves, rather than Jesus; when the lights of commerce cast the light of God into the shadows; when we are concerned for gifts, but cold toward those who are marginalised.” He then added in unscripted remarks: “This worldliness has taken Christmas hostage. It needs to be freed.” At Canterbury Cathedral, Justin Welby, the head of the Church of England, spoke of uncertainty, anxiety and fear in the world, and warned against putting trust in the wrong things and values in the wrong place. “The end of 2016 finds us all in a different kind of world, one less predictable and certain, which feels more awash with fear and division,” said the archbishop of Canterbury and leader of the worldwide Anglican communion. He told worshippers: “Uncertainty in the midst of so much, but far from universal, prosperity is a sign of our trust being in the wrong things. It tells us that our values are in the wrong place … “Economic progress, technological progress, communication progress hasn’t resulted in economic justice. It hasn’t delivered glory for us.” Nigel Farage, the former Ukip leader, attracted criticism after attacking Welby’s Christmas message on Twitter. He wrote: “Merry Christmas. Ignore all negative messages from the Archbishop of Canterbury and have a great day!” Cardinal Vincent Nichols, the archbishop of Westminster and leader of the Catholic church in England and Wales, also addressed the challenges of the past year in his midnight mass homily at Westminster Cathedral. He quoted WB Yeats’s 1919 poem, The Second Coming: “Things fall apart, the centre cannot hold / Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world.” These words, Nichols told the congregation, “reflect the deep and widening sense of uncertainty many feel today. This is not the time or place to reflect on reasons or causes, but it is right to recognise these anxieties and fears.” Referring to the lowly shepherds who found a place by Jesus’s crib in Bethlehem, the cardinal said: “In our thoughts, prayers and actions, there has to be room for the poor of our time so that they too may know this respect and concern. The list of those seeking our welcome is long: the homeless, the refugee, the victim of violence and human trafficking. Their voices call out for our compassion.” Nichols also highlighted the needs and uncertainties facing those caring for elderly parents and relatives. “They are so frightened that resources to meet the basic needs of their loved ones are being withdrawn as care services are reviewed and reduced. For many elderly and needy people not only are these basic needs sometimes left unmet, but human contact disappears and the darkness of loneliness closes in. “Meeting this challenge requires a recognition that good care for the elderly and vulnerable is not only important but nothing less than a defining characteristic of our society,” he said. In the face of anxiety about the “current instability in economic prospects and in the effectiveness of political structures”, people should “strive for truth, respect, compassion and forgiveness”, he said. Earlier this week, the Prince of Wales also warned about disturbing trends in 2016. “We are now seeing the rise of many populist groups across the world that are increasingly aggressive to those who adhere to a minority faith. All of this has deeply disturbing echoes of the dark days of the 1930s,” Prince Charles said on the Radio 4 Today programme’s Thought for the Day slot. “That nearly 70 years later we should still be seeing such evil persecution is to me beyond all belief,” he said. “We owe it to those who suffered and died so horribly not to repeat the horrors of the past.”",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Dad’s final, defiant Christmas was the best ever", "content": "It is hard to believe that it’s now 10 years since that last, defiant Christmas. In the summer, we had celebrated my father’s 70th birthday. In the autumn, he began to lose his words. He called me one day to say he’d been having “a few, sort of memory problems”, and there was something in his voice beyond the usual mild-mannered hesitancy. Something that made me immediately take my dog and catch a train to Cambridge. My parents met us at the station. As soon as we got into the car, my dog scrambled over and climbed on to my father’s lap. The memory loss was particular and strange. It was as though certain words had become detached from the objects they signified. We were eating strawberries, I remember. Dad looked down at his bowl and frowned. “Microphones?” he said. A blood test, he described to me as them taking some “ink” from his arm. The Christmas my in-laws threw out my treasured books: Carol Birch Read more The impression was not of delusional thinking. Dad didn’t believe the strawberries were actually microphones. Rather, he looked at the strawberries and the word for them wasn’t there. He reached for another and tried it for fit. “Microphones?” It wasn’t right, but he couldn’t find the word that was. “Strawberries?” I said. And he laughed. “Of course! Strawberries,” he said. “How silly.” His GP had referred him to the memory clinic to be assessed for dementia. There was a three-month wait, but in any case, dementia seemed unlikely. We had known people with dementia and it did not present like this. My mother thought it might be psychological. Dad had retired in the summer from his readership in pure mathematics, and though, externally at least, this change had made little difference – he still cycled in to his old department every day, where he was working on a book on Banach algebra, and he still played an active part in college life – Mum thought the loss of his professional role might be having an impact on him. My sister and I were unconvinced, and so, I think, was she. We rang his GP and got put through to a different doctor, who agreed to see Dad that evening. At 8am the following morning, he was having an emergency scan. Glioblastoma multiforme is the most aggressive type of brain tumour. Thread-like tendrils burrow deep into the brain, making it all but impossible to remove the tumour completely. Dad’s was on his left frontal lobe, in the area responsible for expressive language. They operated to excise as much of the tumour as they could, and Dad came round to discover that, as if by magic, his words had returned. Still high from the anaesthetic, he lay, head bandaged, in his hospital bed, riffing with consummate fluency, this gentle, self-effacing man, unaccustomed to the centre stage and rather surprised to find himself enjoying it after all. There was no question of survival. A few weeks to a few months, they said. It was incomprehensible. But perhaps the finality of the prognosis was in some sense also a blessing. We did not invest our hopes in some percentage chance; there was no chance. We focused instead on the now. 'I lost my mum seven weeks ago': our readers on coping with grief at Christmas Read more And so it was that we embraced that Christmas, in a spirit of neither despair, nor hope, but rather, of defiant celebration. We would enjoy the best Christmas ever. We would relish every precious moment. We would be happy, and we were. We didn’t do anything different. The pleasure of Christmas is in the traditions. The same decorations hung on the tree. My sister and I joke-argued as we had every year over whose angel’s turn it was to top it. I cannot remember who won. We ate the same foods, played the same silly games – word games mostly: consequences, drawing book titles. I can see Dad now, his scar extending from under his yellow paper crown, dabbing tears of laughter from his eyes at Mum’s attempts to guess Love in the Time of Cholera from his peculiar pencil squiggles. It was all the same, but the light at the heart had been turned up a notch. We went to midnight mass at the friary. My parents were Catholics; I am not, but there is comfort to be found in the rituals of Christmas, the line stretching forward and back. So too in the rituals of death. In a few months, my father’s coffin would sit in this chapel the night before his funeral. I did not consciously think of it, but I can see now it was an awareness of this, of the inevitability of the end, that made that Christmas so joyful. Christmas is about birth, of course, but it is also about death. You cannot have one without the other. Time is precious. That’s why the wise men bring myrrh.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Diversity of purpose vital for rural churches", "content": "Harriet Sherwood raises some interesting questions, but misses a fundamental point (Christmas challenge for vicars with multiple challenges, 23 December). England’s amazing collection of historic rural churches should not be viewed as a liability or a burden. Rather, we should celebrate the existence of such a vast and beautiful array of capital assets, unique in the world and of incomparable historic, social and indeed economic value. Key to their revival is the application of fresh ideas and energy, from which funding and footfall can and do follow. As your author notes, diversification of purpose is essential. Prior to the late 19th century, churches served as multi-purpose centres of activity, both secular and spiritual, social and civic. Our post-Victorian narrowness of vision has in many ways caused the decline of popular usage. The Churches Conservation Trust has demonstrated many innovative and practical models of working among our 350 exemplar church buildings.

{ "title":"Rick Parfitt obituary", "content": "The raucous chugging sound of Status Quo has been a constant presence for almost half a century of rock’n’roll, ever since the band gave up on the idea of playing psychedelic music at the end of the 1960s in favour of a grittier approach. The singer and rhythm guitarist Rick Parfitt, who has died aged 68 from an infection, had been a pivotal member of the band even before it became known as Status Quo. He and his fellow singer/guitarist Francis Rossi constituted the group’s creative core, and between them set the band’s matey, wisecracking tone. By the time of Parfitt’s death, Status Quo had notched up more than 60 hits on the UK singles charts and released 32 studio albums, as well as a string of live albums and compilations. In the process they became one of the most successful British bands of all time, scoring chart hits in every decade from the 1960s until 2010 and spending more than 200 weeks in the UK singles chart. Among numerous career highlights, Quo were the opening act at Live Aid at Wembley stadium in July 1985, aptly kicking off with Rockin’ All Over the World, and were back at Wembley in 2007 for the Concert for Diana. In 1991 Quo earned themselves a place in the Guinness World Records by playing four arena-sized concerts across Britain in one day, and in 2005 Rossi and Parfitt cemented their status as household names by appearing in Coronation Street. In 2010 both were appointed OBE. Born in Woking, Surrey, Rick was the son of Richard, an insurance man whom he described as a “drinker and a gambler”, and Lillian, who worked in cake shops. The family lived in a three-bedroom house on the Elmbridge council estate, and Rick attended Goldsworth school. Having started learning guitar at the age of 11 he left at 15 to try his hand in music. He got off to a promising start with a regular solo slot at the Sunshine Holiday Camp on Hayling Island in Hampshire, which brought him £5 a week. By the time he first met Rossi at Butlin’s holiday camp in Minehead, west Somerset, in 1965, Parfitt was playing in a trio called the Highlights. Rossi was a member of the Spectres, who went on to release three singles on the Pye Records subsidiary Piccadilly. All were flops and, this being 1967, the band decided to join pop’s then burgeoning psychedelic wave, changing their name to Traffic Jam for the purpose. At the suggestion of their manager, Pat Barlow, they also decided they needed an extra vocalist and contacted Parfitt, who was happy to accept. Shortly afterwards they changed their name again to the Status Quo, to avoid confusion with Steve Winwood’s group Traffic. The new lineup – Parfitt and Rossi plus the drummer John Coghlan, bassist Alan Lancaster and keyboard player Roy Lynes – immediately felt their luck changing as their single Pictures of Matchstick Men (1968), written by Rossi, reached No 7 in the UK and the Top 40 in the US. They had another UK Top 10 hit later that year with Ice in the Sun, but their debut album, Picturesque Matchstickable Messages from the Status Quo, failed to chart. The “the” was then dropped from their name, and when the follow-up long-player, Spare Parts (1969), also flopped, the group decided to abandon psychedelia and pursue a tougher rock sound, matched by an earthy jeans-and-T-shirts image. In 1970 they reached No 12 with the rollicking single Down the Dustpipe, but the ensuing albums Ma Kelly’s Greasy Spoon (1970) and Dog of Two Head (1971), their first without Lynes, were unsuccessful. They signed a new deal with Vertigo and made the self-produced album Piledriver (1972). This delivered a hit with Paper Plane, a track exhibiting the classic Quo trademarks of churning guitars, super-simple lyrics and a 12-bar structure (doubled to 24 bars in this case). The album soared to No 5. They had found a formula that worked, with production and most of the songwriting now handled by the band members. They systematically exploited it across albums which would appear at yearly intervals until 1983. Hello! (1973) was their first No 1 album and generated the Top 5 single Caroline. On the Level (1975) went straight in at No 1 and gave the band their first chart-topping single, Down Down. The following Year’s Blue for You also debuted at No 1, having been preceded by the Top 10 hit Rain. “It’s simple but I think it’s effective,” Parfitt said of the song, which he wrote. “It’s marginally different from the normal Quo stuff, it’s slightly more laid-back than anything we’ve done on single.” Parfitt also hit back at the band’s critics. “People try to dismiss what we do but they can’t. People have terrible goes at us about the music being simple when it’s not really. It appears simple perhaps in its chording but generally, to actually play what we play and how we play it, it’s not simple. It’s bloody hard work.” In 1977 the group hired Pip Williams to produce Rockin’ All Over the World, from which the title track, written by John Fogerty, would become another Quo staple. Further milestones included Whatever You Want (1979), its hit title track co-written by Parfitt, and Never Too Late (1981), recorded in the same batch of sessions in Dublin with producer John Eden as Just Supposin’ (1980). 1+9+8+2 (1982) was their fourth and final chart-topping album, and saw Pete Kircher listed as the new drummer and Andy Bown, already a regular Quo sideman, billed as keyboard player. The group disbanded temporarily in 1985, the Wembley Live Aid appearance being the last performance by this lineup. With the bassist John Edwards and drummer Jeff Rich, Parfitt made a solo album, Recorded Delivery, which was never released, though some tracks from it later appeared as Status Quo B-sides. Rich and Edwards now joined Parfitt, Rossi and Bown in a new-look Quo, though a lawsuit brought by Alan Lancaster had to be settled before normal service could resume. This left Parfitt and Rossi in possession of the Status Quo name, and they celebrated by releasing In the Army Now (1986), the title tune giving them a No 2 hit. The group had passed their record-selling peak, but they continued to command a huge fanbase. In 1986 they played with Queen at Wembley stadium, and toured Europe with them. They made a splash on the singles charts with two medleys, The Anniversary Waltz Part One and Part Two (both 1990), and hit the top spot in 1994 with Come On You Reds, though this was credited to Manchester United with Status Quo. Amid albums of new material, Don’t Stop: The 30th Anniversary Album (1996) and Famous in the Last Century (2000) were collections of cover versions. Parfitt had never bothered to curb his enthusiasm for rock’n’roll excess, and in 2004 gave details of his penchant for drink-driving and drug abuse in XS All Areas, an autobiography that he co-wrote with Rossi. In 1997 he underwent quadruple bypass surgery after doctors warned that his partygoing lifestyle threatened to kill him. He was back onstage within three months. In 2005 he had tests for suspected throat cancer but was given the all clear. In August 2014 he fell ill while the band were on tour in Croatia, and needed to have further heart surgery. His personal life, too, had been tumultuous. He met the 17-year-old Patty Beedon in 1968, but after two years he split with her and married Marietta Boeker. In 1974 they had a son, Richard, but their daughter Heidi drowned when she was two. “Life went on and you learn to live with it, but you never get over it,” Parfitt said. The tragedy wrecked the marriage, and in 1988 Parfitt married Beedon. They had a son, Harry, in 1989, then divorced after Parfitt had a belated fling with Boeker, before reuniting in 2000. They parted for good after Parfitt secretly became engaged to Lyndsay Whitburn, a beauty salon owner, whom he married in 2006. Their twins Tommy and Lily were born in 2008. “The flip side of Rick is not nice,” commented Patty. “It’s a shame, because he can be such a lovely man.” Meanwhile Status Quo’s career had evolved into a sequence of special events. In 1999 they mounted their Night of the Proms tour of Europe with a full orchestra, and in 2000 played in the Australian outback on a railway carriage of the Great South Pacific Express. In 2003 they played at the event party after the British grand prix at Silverstone, in 2007 they were at the rebuilt Wembley stadium for the Concert for Diana, and in 2009 they played at Carrickfergus Castle and Glastonbury. Quo reached No 10 with their Quid Pro Quo album (2011), boosted by a deluxe format edition exclusively available from Tesco, and followed up with a UK arena tour. Hello Quo!, a two and a half hour documentary about the band’s history, appeared in 2012, and was much more kindly received than Bula Quo! (2013), a comedy feature in which the band got mixed up with a murder mystery in Fiji. The album Aquostic II: That’s a Fact was released two months ago. Like its predecessor, Aquostic: Stripped Bare (2014), which reached No 5 in the UK chart, it comprises songs from Quo’s catalogue in new acoustic arrangements. In 2015 Universal Music released the compilation Accept No Substitute!: The Definitive Hits. Parfitt suffered a severe heart attack in June this year after a performance in Antalya, Turkey. Freddie Edwards, John Edwards’ son, stood in for him at short notice, and Richie Malone became his longer-term replacement. Parfitt announced his retirement from touring with the group, but had been planning a solo album and an autobiography for next year. The infection that led to his death followed complications from a shoulder injury. Parfitt is survived by Lyndsay, Tommy and Lily, and by the sons, Richard and Harry, from each of his previous marriages. • Richard John Parfitt, singer, songwriter and guitarist, born 12 October 1948; died 24 December 2016",diasaster:0},

{ "title":"The Guardian view on democracy: an uncertain year ", "content": "In the annals of modern democracy, 2016 has been pretty eventful. For some in Britain and the US, it has been a great year: in this version of events the will of the people, in the form of votes for Brexit and Donald Trump, has smashed triumphantly through the complacent expectations and blinkered preoccupations of a political elite. For others, though, electorates have delivered results that will be self-evidently harmful both to citizens of these nations, and to stability in the wider world. There has been a distinctly authoritarian streak visible, too, from leaders of democracies including India and Turkey. Demagoguery, the scourge of democracy, has reared its head. According to this view, security – the bottom-line responsibility of government – seems imperilled, particularly in the US, where fears grow that internationally agreed measures to alleviate climate change may well be overturned, and loose words from a verbally incontinent incoming president could spark who-knows-what consequences. Under these circumstances, some might silently hanker after the rule of philosopher kings or wise guardians – the trained statesmen and stateswomen suggested in Plato’s thought experiment, the Republic – rather than the emotionally erratic people, motivated by anger, frustration and fear. Anger, indeed, was the keynote of 2016: when the world’s most furious Twitter troll has been elected to the presidency of the US, rationalism looks to be in short supply, and Thomas Hobbes’s notion that man is at heart an unruly morass of passions and desires gains traction. The word democracy derives from the Greek demos, people, and kratos, grip. That grip has recently seemed violent and uncomfortable to some. In these disturbing circumstances, headlines have begun to ask whether democracy is in crisis, a question that political scientists have been mulling over for some years, with thinkers such as Colin Crouch wondering whether we are moving into a “post-democratic” era. Professor Crouch’s idea is that we may be entering a phase in which the energy is ebbing from the democratic process, in which turnout is largely on the wane, and in which democracy may become, increasingly, a shell from within which a socioeconomic elite actually runs things. If you accept that line of thought, Brexit and Trump certainly look like howls of protest. A decade of decline for democracy A decade of decline for democracy Claiming precise parallels between our modern democracies and those of ancient Greece is a fool’s game. Today’s representative democracies are very different from their distant ancestors, the direct democracies that developed in different forms in the Greek world, notably in Athens, in the 5th century BC. There, an assembly of the adult male citizenry (a minority of the population, since women and slaves were excluded) voted on, for example, even intricate matters of foreign policy. That meant every vote was effectively a referendum (though a referendum, it is worth noting, with checks and balances, since the measures voted for could be revised through the people’s law courts). Most officials, too, were chosen by lot; and then there was ostracism, a rarely invoked method by which politicians could be ejected from the city state for a decade. And yet it can often be illuminating to think with the debate-loving Greeks in mind, not least since they bequeathed to later thinkers the earliest examples of political theory in action, back in those moments when democracy was newly minted. The very first comes courtesy of the historian Herodotus, a native of what is now the Mediterranean coast of Turkey. Recounting the deposing of a usurper on the throne of Persia in his Histories (c440BC), he sets forth a debate between the leading conspirators, who discuss what form of government they should choose. (It is an imagined scene: this is the atmosphere of Greek debate transposed to a Persian court that was not about to abandon monarchy.) Each of the three plotters speaks up for a different form of government – democracy, oligarchy and monarchy. In defending democracy, using the then current catchword isonomia, equality before the law, the plotter Otanes says: “It is government by lot, it is accountable government, and it refers all decisions to the common people.” Megabyzus contends, on the other hand, that democracy is a kind of mob rule, and “there is nothing more stupid or given to brutality … the approach of the general populace is that of a river swollen with winter rain: they rush blindly forward and sweep things before them”. An image that might ring bells in 2016. The Athenian Michael Gove An even more telling episode, perhaps, is that narrated in Thucydides’s History of the Peloponnesian War, the conflict between Athens and Sparta that wore on between 431 and 404BC. In 427, the Athenians debated what to do about the town of Mytilene on Lesbos, which had revolted from their alliance. They voted to kill all the male citizens of the town, and to enslave the women and children – and duly set off in the ship of the day, a trireme. But overnight they thought better of it and held a second debate. The hawkish Cleon, who turns out to be a distant intellectual ancestor of the pro-leave campaigner Michael Gove, and indeed of Mr Trump, speaks out against experts. “As a general rule states are better governed by the man in the street than by intellectuals,” he says. On the other side, Diodotus urges the citizens to reconsider their fury: “Haste and anger are, to my mind, the two greatest obstacles to wise counsel.” The second referendum delivers a different result. A second trireme is sent out to Lesbos, and, miraculously, overtakes the first. The Mytilenaeans are spared. Democracy back from margins Despite the intriguing persistence of these discourses of anger and expertise, there is no glib comparison to be drawn here. No second referendum on Brexit will be offered, no trireme sent out to Brussels in the nick of time. The most productive way of comparing Athens of the 5th century BC with our modern democracies is by way of difference. As Professor Paul Cartledge, author of this year’s Democracy: A Life has pointed out, democracy was a way of life in 5th-century Athens. It was not something that others got on with while the rest attended to their own business; it was Athenian culture as much as it was its system of government. It has never, of course, been quite that in Britain; but at the moment it can feel that politics is less a part of citizens’ culture than it ever has been since the franchise was fully extended in 1928. The decline of industry and the reduction of the importance of trade unions have not helped. There have been signs of a kickback – the passionate engagement in Scotland in the run-up to the 2014 referendum, for example, and the growth of movements such as Momentum, and, briefly, Occupy. And yet if our democracy is to function as something more than a shell, it needs to be stitched back into citizens’ lives. Democracy will never be quite our way of being, as it was for the Athenians, but we must find ways to bring it back from the margins. A properly functioning everyday democracy is one in which people have the chance to participate in shaping public life – and who take the opportunity to do so. That, sadly, is not quite where we are in 2016.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Boxing Day shoppers expected to splash out before Brexit price rises", "content": "Millions of Britons are expected to flock to the shops on Boxing Day as they make the most of the honeymoon period before Brexit-related price hikes trickle down to the high street. Some of the country’s biggest shopping centres are predicting bumper crowds as retailers slash the price of their winter clothing, TVs, laptops and furniture ranges. Gordon McKinnon, operations director at Intu, which owns Manchester’s Trafford Centre and the Metrocentre in Gateshead, said it expected more than 1m shoppers to visit its centres. “It is a huge shopping day because even though there is more discounting before Christmas there are still a lot of retailers, like Next, John Lewis and Selfridges that don’t. There’s a big push from Boxing Day - that’s the emotional bit. People want to go out and get their first fix of the sales.” Retailers across the board have signalled the weakness of sterling will push up prices in 2017 as the cost of importing goods increases. Fashion retailer Next has said its clothing prices will rise by up to 5% while electrical goods retailers Dixons Carphone and AO have also said their suppliers want to charge more. Apple has pushed up the price of every computer in its range, while Microsoft and Dell have also signalled that price hikes are on the way. Myf Ryan, the chief marketing officer at Westfeld UK and Europe, said Boxing Day was the busiest day of the Christmas trading period for its London malls in 2015. “Last year over 330,000 shoppers visited our two Westfield centres in London and this year we are expecting similar numbers,” she said. “During the Christmas period last year, shoppers spent over £500,000 per hour.” Despite the pictures of crowded high streets at this time of year, Diane Wehrle, marketing and insights director at Springboard, says the overall number of people who physically visit the shops in December has declined in six of the last seven consecutive years - a worrying trend for retailers that helps explain why so many resort to offering pre-Christmas discounts. Wehrle says shopper numbers were down by more than 2% in the first half of December but that the decline was less than the 3% drop recorded in 2015. “We are losing fewer people every year while online is growing but at a slower rate,” she said. “It’s not a boom year [for retailers] but it’s not a bad year either. Unlike Black Friday, Boxing Day is part of the holiday and culturally has a lot of significance.” Retailers in London’s West End are expected to outperform the national picture as the devaluation of sterling since the Brexit vote draws high spending tourists to its high end department stores and luxury brands. Jace Tyrrell, chief executive of New West End Company - which represents retailers in Oxford Street, Regent Street and Bond Street - predicted today would be one of the district’s most successful single shopping days in recent years. Takings are expected to hit £55m. “Boxing Day is becoming increasingly popular as a shopping day as customers become savvier, more price sensitive and better at researching purchases,” said Tyrell. “We expect a significantly higher number of Chinese tourists to come over specifically to bargain hunt.” While the total number of transactions in the West End last week was actually down by more than 14% in the week before Christmas, the average “basket value” increased by 28%, highlighting the impact of the currency effect. The average value of a Chinese shopper’s purchase was nearly five times higher than that of a domestic shopper, at £1,073 versus £212, said Tyrell. The pull of the Boxing day sales belies the 24 hour shopping trend ushered in by the internet. With many retailers launching sales online on Christmas Eve, the shops never really close anymore, although this year there has been a push by several retailers, including Fat Face and jeweller Beaverbrooks to stay closed on Boxing Day. John Lewis has never opened the day after Christmas. According to data compiled by the association for online retailers IMRG, an estimated £805m will have been spent on the virtual high street yesterday [25th December] as Britons immediately cashed in gift cards, received as presents, to download games and music and take advantage of early bird sales. It predicts close to £1bn will be spent online again today. Boxing Day Deals Currys PC World’s best offers include a 49–inch Samsung 4K Ultra HD TV for £649 - a £250 reduction - and GoPro Hero+ camcorders half price at £99.99. Offers at Habitat include the Pedley shelving unit, half price at £250 and the Abu coffee table, down from £180 to £80. For fans of designer fashion, Whistles has slashed the price of the Mia patchwork sheepskin coat by £600 to £1,200. Its Drew collarless leather biker jacket is also half price at £180. At footwear chain Office there is £50 off UGGs with the Australian brand’s classic short boots selling for £105 while white Adidas Superstar 80s are £50 - a reduction of nearly 40%. Kitchen outfitter Magnet is trumpeting a half price sale with the Fusion Champagne kitchen (based on 8 units with laminate worktops) down from £10,420 to £4,789.

{ "title":"'Alliance of hope': US and Japan leaders meet for historic Pearl Harbor first", "content": "With $12.50 – half a month’s salary – in his pocket, Harold Mainer was about to go ashore to celebrate his friend’s birthday. Then, just before 8am, came the angry buzz of hundreds of Japanese warplanes, swarming the sky and raining destruction. The surprise attack on the US naval base at Pearl Harbor had begun. “I couldn’t believe it was happening but it did happen,” recalls Mainer, 95, who had been standing on the deck of the USS Helena, a light cruiser, when the serenity was shattered. “The first three bombs I saw. One hit the waterway, the other one hit the runway, the other one hit the hangar deck. You didn’t have time to think. You just did what you were trying to do.” President Franklin Roosevelt declared it “a date which will live in infamy”, and soon the US would be embroiled in the second world war. But Mainer, who survived the Helena being torpedoed and used a water hose to wash away the remains of a fallen comrade, reflects: “We knew war had started before he declared war. We knew they weren’t going to get away with it.” Seventy-five years after the raid that left 2,403 Americans dead and 19 vessels sunk or crippled, American and Japanese heads of state are to stand together at Pearl Harbor in Hawaii for the first time. Barack Obama and Shinzo Abe, the Japanese prime minister, will visit the USS Arizona memorial on 27 December to honour those killed and, says the White House, “showcase the power of reconciliation”, though Abe is not likely to offer an apology. The event comes seven months after Obama became the first American president to travel to Hiroshima, where the US dropped an atomic bomb in 1945 – the other bookend of the war in the Pacific. Among the dwindling band of veterans, not all have been disposed to endorse such gestures but Mainer, for one, is content for Abe to set foot in Pearl Harbor. “If that’s what he wants to do, that’s all right with me,” he said, attending a commemoration in Washington on the recent 75th anniversary of the attack. “I don’t know what to say. I have no anger. “I was talking to a school one time and there was a little eight-year-old boy. He says, ‘Can I ask you something?’ I said, ‘Yeah, sure.’ He asked me my feelings about the Japanese people. It threw me. I thought to myself and said: ‘I tell you what, them Japanese sailors felt they were right, the same as I felt I was right, but I said in the end it proved that I was right. He was satisfied with it and everybody else was satisfied with it, and I thought that was about as a good an answer as I could give.” Symbolism has been a key part of the Obama presidency – for example, his visit to Cuba earlier this year. He promised a “pivot to Asia” during his eights years in office with mixed results. The Trans-Pacific Partnership, once declared by Abe a crucial “pillar” of future US influence, has been doomed by the election of Donald Trump as his successor. But the US-Japan relationship could be more important than ever as Trump spars with the region’s biggest power, China. His phone conversation with the leader of Taiwan threatened to upend relations with Beijing, whereas his first face-to-face meeting with a foreign leader following his election was with Abe. Abe will not, as had been initially reported, be the first Japanese leader to go to Pearl Harbor. In 1951 the then prime minister, Shigeru Yoshida, visited the US national cemetery in Honolulu and the US military command centre facing Pearl Harbor. Abe, though, will be the first Japanese leader to pay tribute at the memorial to the sunken USS Arizona and to be accompanied by the American president. There is overwhelming support among the Japanese public for Abe’s visit: according to a Kyodo News poll at the weekend, 85.3% agreed that he should go to the site, while 10.9% disagreed. Koichi Nakano, professor of Japanese politics at Sophia University in Tokyo, believes the visit is an attempt by Abe to underscore the strength of the US-Japan alliance “before Trump, who is a potentially destabilising factor, assumes office”. Nakano added: “The fact that he is visiting Pearl Harbor without offering an apology makes it look like he is merely using the historic site for political purposes.” Abe’s critics say he appears willing to make conciliatory gestures to US audiences, while resisting demands to do the same from Japan’s former enemies in Asia. South Korea and China have long insisted that Japan has yet to properly apologise for its wartime conduct, and have accused Abe of attempting to rewrite the darker episodes of his country’s wartime history. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Barack Obama and Shinzo Abe walk after laying wreaths in front of a cenotaph to offer prayers for victims of the atomic bombing in 1945 at Hiroshima Peace Memorial park. Photograph: Kimimasa Mayama/EPA Anger of wartime sex slaves haunts Japan and South Korea Read more He has, for example, denied that tens of thousands of “comfort women”, mainly from the Korean peninsula, were coerced by the Japanese imperial army into working as sex slaves in frontline military brothels. At a joint session of the US Congress in April last year, he offered “eternal condolences” for the loss of American lives during the war and acknowledged that Japan had caused “suffering to the peoples of Asian countries”, but did not mention specific wartime atrocities. In August that year, he marked the 70th anniversary of the end of the Pacific war with an expression of “deep remorse”, but stopped short of issuing a fresh apology, adding that future generations of Japanese should not be “predestined” to apologise for the actions of militarist governments during the first half of the 20th century. “The Japanese people have long since accepted the notion that Japan was defeated by the US – but not by China,” Nakano said. “Even the conservatives have largely come to accommodate the fact that they were given a second chance in the postwar period by the US victors. So, for the prime minister to visit Pearl Harbor is a non-issue in Japan. On the other hand, apologising to China and Korea, visiting Nanjing or meeting former ‘comfort women’ would be infinitely harder for him to do.” Jeff Kingston, director of Asian Studies at Temple University, agreed that Abe hoped to put the past behind both countries and “create positive momentum as he enters an unpredictable relationship with Trump”. “It is mostly about the photo op, but given Abe’s revisionist views on history that glorify imperial Japan and exonerate it from wartime misdeed, he is not the most credible messenger on reconciliation.” Obama’s visit to Hiroshima in May “conveyed remorse because of his public stance against nuclear weapons, while Abe’s record of rehabilitating the wartime past means that his presence does not convey a similar sincerity and contrition,” he added. At the time, Trump, then a presidential candidate, tweeted: “Does President Obama ever discuss the sneak attack on Pearl Harbor while he’s in Japan? Thousands of American lives lost.” A Japanese government official, who did not wish to be named, said Abe’s visit reflected his desire for reconciliation and to reiterate his belief that the US and Japan must continue to build an “alliance of hope” in the face of new regional threats from China and North Korea. At a recent briefing in Washington, the White House press secretary, Josh Earnest struck a similar note. Asked if some veterans might be angered if Abe did not apologise, he replied: “Yes, there may be some who feel personally embittered. But I’m confident that many will set aside their own personal bitterness, not because they’re personally satisfied by the words of the prime minister, but because they recognise how important this moment is for the United States. And that’s certainly why they qualify to be described as the greatest generation.” The man who survived Hiroshima: 'I had entered a living hell on earth' Read more It was a comment that could comfortably be applied to Mainer, the 95-year-old veteran from Charleston, Arkansas. He said of Abe: “I don’t criticise him. I don’t think he needs to apologise. I wouldn’t want Harry Truman to apologise for what he did. If it hadn’t been for Pearl Harbor, there wouldn’t have been an atomic bomb.” Mainer lost many shipmates that day – it was the deadliest attack on US territory until 11 September 2001 – and was on the Helena when it was torpedoed again by the Japanese in July 1943, watching it sink from a life raft and waiting four hours for rescue. But he holds no rancour as Abe and Obama seek to bury the last ghosts. “I don’t feel hard at them; I don’t want them to feel hard at me,” he said philosophically. “It was a long time ago. You learn to live with it and forget about it. I think time has the forgiveness part of it. I stayed over there 49 months and I had a lot of time to think. Holding grudges doesn’t help it; it hurts you more than them, and I’ve learned to live with that.”",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"2016 was the end of the world as we know it. So what's next?", "content": "The phrase “turning point” is overused, but future historians are likely to view the year 2016 as exactly that. The standout event was Donald Trump’s surprise victory. The maverick Republican’s defeat of Hillary Clinton produced a shock that reverberated around the world. The billionaire’s White House tenancy begins on 20 January. Many will dub that date Black Friday, fearful that Trumpism may irreparably damage international security, environmental protection and human rights. Others will see it as a sign of welcome change. It will be a year of living dangerously. Yet 2016 was remarkable for many other reasons – good and bad. The fightback against Islamic State in Syria and Iraq gathered pace, even as terrorist atrocities took lives from Nice to Jakarta. A peace deal was signed in Colombia, ending the world’s longest-running insurgency. The European Union was thrown into confusion by Britain’s vote to leave. The Paris agreement marked a breakthrough on climate change. Elections and referendums Trump’s protectionist, isolationist stance brought into question the inevitability of globalisation, suggesting a return to a pre-1939 age of economic nationalism, punitive tariffs, trade barriers, controls on movement of labour and capital, closed markets and minds. Many hope Trump will take a more pragmatic, less iconoclastic line. But he questioned the usefulness of international institutions such as the United Nations, the World Bank and Nato. He cast doubt on key security alliances in Asia. Trump also ignited concern for April’s Paris climate change deal. Trump’s stated support for the unilateral waging of war, for authoritarian governance, torture, indefinite detention without trial, and religious and racial profiling of immigrants and refugees could, if copied, destroy the universal legal and human rights protections erected via the UN system since 1945. The first world leader Trump spoke to after his victory was Egypt’s military coup leader, Abdel Fatah al-Sisi, giving a chilling insight into his priorities. Britain’s narrow 52%-48% referendum vote in June in favour of leaving the EU was unexpected. Many drew parallels with the US, saying similar nationalist, populist forces were at work, fuelled by anger that globalisation and accompanying immigration were undermining low-paid workers’ way of life. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Supporters of the Stronger In campaign react as results of Britain’s EU referendum are announced. Photograph: Rob Stothard/AFP/Getty Images If the British government’s timetable holds, Brexit will begin in March, when the UK will formally file for divorce. Tough negotiations are expected, focused on freedom of movement (which Britain wants to curtail) and unfettered UK access to the single market (which other EU members oppose). Divisions within Britain over Brexit can be expected to deepen, especially if sterling devalues further, and, as expected, the cost of living rises sharply. Political strains in Europe will further complicate the post-Brexit picture. France will hold a presidential election in spring. Marine Le Pen, of the far-right National Front, is expected to do very well. Le Pen wants France to quit the EU and euro. Her main challenger is likely to be François Fillon, a Catholic Thatcherite, for the centre right. The Socialist president, François Hollande, will not stand for re-election. In the Netherlands’ March general election, the Islamophobe Geert Wilders could prove an influential warm-up act for Le Pen. Wilders advocates a Dutch “Nexit”. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Marine Le Pen with supporters. Photograph: Claude Paris/AP Germany holds federal elections in September. Angela Merkel is seeking re-election for a fourth term as chancellor, but faces strong opposition from the anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany. All this internal uncertainty may paralyse the EU in 2017 as it faces record refugee influxes, chronic eurozone weakness, threats from Russia and an uncertain partner in Washington. The fashionable idea that Merkel will pick up the torch from Obama and become defender-in-chief of western liberal democracy looks like wishful thinking. Conflicts and terrorism Despite repeated UN attempts at peace, Syria’s civil war passed the five-year mark in 2016 and approached a bloody denouement. Russia’s intervention made a decisive difference. Western-backed rebels were pushed back. The regime of President Bashar al-Assad was encouraged to believe it could survive. The siege of eastern Aleppo became a symbol of the suffering and brutality of the Syrian war. Children were killed or maimed in large numbers. Hospitals and schools were repeatedly hit and UN relief supplies were suspended after an aid convoy was strafed. In September, the US, Britain and France staged a diplomatic protest at the UN security council, accusing Russia’s forces and leaders of possible war crimes and threatening new sanctions. Moscow was unmoved. Backed by Assad’s other main ally, Iran, Russia claimed the west was supporting jihadi terrorists and pursuing illegal regime change. By year’s end, the battle for Aleppo appeared over as rebel resistance crumbled. The evacuation of wounded civilians began amid reports of renewed atrocities. Assad and Iran claimed “victory”. And fears grew that the civil war would be superseded by a new struggle between external forces for control of land and resources. In Iraq, an offensive to retake Mosul from Isis got bogged down. The war in Yemen showed no sign of abating, notwithstanding a furore in Britain and the US about arms sales to Saudi Arabia, whose airstrikes are blamed for numerous civilian deaths. In Libya, a new threat from Isis emerged, centred on the late Muammar Gaddafi’s stronghold in Sirte, prompting fierce fighting. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Pupils gather at their school in Saada, Yemen, after it was hit by a Saudi-led airstrike. Photograph: Naif Rahma/Reuters Isis was also active in Afghanistan, challenging the Taliban for control of rural areas. Afghanistan is now America’s longest war. More than 8,000 US troops are still based there, though Nato combat forces have left. Will Trump try to finish it in 2017, as Obama vainly tried to do in 2009? Or will he cut and run, leaving the Afghans to fight it out? Trump says defeating Isis is his top priority abroad. He appointed Michael Flynn, a former general who has claimed it is rational to fear Muslims, as national security adviser – one of several nominations of hawks to key posts. The thought that he could be tasked with fulfilling Trump’s pledge to “bomb the shit out of Isis” unnerved observers. The year is likely to see a narrowing American focus on hitting Isis in the caliphate’s heartlands around Mosul and Raqqa in Syria, where the jihadis are besieged by Iraqi and Kurdish forces. The Isis threat will persist, however. Western security agencies fear displaced jihadis could make their way in increasing numbers to Europe in 2017, bent on launching attacks like those in Brussels in March, which killed 32 people, and Nice in July, in which 86 died. Jihadi websites celebrated Trump’s election, anticipating a surge in recruits. Given this polarisation, the global spread of Islamist extremism is likely to continue. In Nigeria, Boko Haram is undefeated, despite the freeing of many schoolgirls abducted in 2014. Muslim majority countries such as Pakistan, Indonesia and Bangladesh face continuing threats. In Dhaka in July, 20 hostages died in a restaurant attack by home-grown jihadis targeting westerners and non-Muslims. In Quetta in October, more than 50 young police recruits died in a massacre blamed on Isis. Facebook Twitter Pinterest A vigil in Dhaka after a terrorist attack at a restaurant in July. Photograph: Zakir Chowdhury/Barcroft Images Democracy and dictators Vladimir Putin, Russia’s president, will keep his title of the west’s top bogeyman in 2017. Syria aside, Russia’s military build-up along its border with the Baltic republics, its meddling in Ukraine, and its covert political influence-peddling, disinformation campaigns and cyber warfare in eastern Europe are expected to accelerate. Trump’s refusal to criticise Putin suggested the US and Russia may see some kind of realpolitik compromise and a return to the concept of “spheres of influence” – a prospect that deeply alarms many Nato states. Trump’s nomination of the Exxon Mobil oilman Rex Tillerson, a Putin pal, as secretary of state added to the unease. If Trump tries another Russian “reset”, the likelihood is that Putin will take what he wants and leave the rest. Putin has been building bridges to Xi Jinping, China’s president. This alliance of convenience will create more headaches for the west in 2017. Xi has enlisted Russia’s support in conducting military “exercises” around disputed South China Sea islands, where Beijing is rapidly expanding its presence. China defied a 2016 UN court ruling deeming its activities illegal. Facebook Twitter Pinterest A billboard in Shandong province with the slogan: ‘South China Sea, our beautiful motherland, we won’t let go an inch.’ Photograph: AP Even before taking office, Trump went on the offensive against China, speaking to Taiwan’s president and questioning the long-established One China policy, under which the US accepts Beijing’s sovereignty. Beijing’s response to Trump was initially angry yet restrained. But there were fears the Taiwan issue might escalate militarily in 2017. Internally, Beijing’s harsh treatment of democrats seeking independence for Hong Kong mirrored what commentators called the biggest crackdown on civil rights and free speech in mainland China since Mao’s Cultural Revolution. The nuclear brinkmanship of North Korea’s paranoid regime increased regional tensions. This problem will possibly come to a head in 2017. Kim Jong-un, the country’s dictator, conducted an underground nuclear test in September, the fifth and biggest, involving nuclear-capable ballistic missiles. In Tokyo, there were calls for Japanese rearmament. Trump suggested Japan and South Korea acquire nuclear weapons. His threat to tear up Obama’s 2015 pact with Iran stoked fears that Tehran may seek to acquire nuclear weapons, sparking a regional arms race and confrontation between Iran and Israel. Like a mafia boss, Trump demanded Japan and South Korea pay more for US bases. In Seoul, scandal forced President Park Geun-hye to resign. All this uncertainty suggests 2017 could be a problematic year for global nuclear non-proliferation efforts. Democracy in south-east Asia fared little better. The death of Thailand’s King Bhumibol Adulyadej further bolstered Bankok’s military junta. In Myanmar, there was better news. Aung San Suu Kyi, the veteran opposition leader, became the country’s de facto leader, appearing at the UN in September. But her failure to condemn repression of the Muslim minority reflected the fragility of her position. The biggest regional upset was in the Philippines, where the foul-mouthed Rodrigo Duterte was elected president. Thousands of alleged gangsters and drug-dealers have since died in a government crackdown. Duterte admitted killing alleged criminals. Protests from the US and UN prompted him to turn to China for support, repudiating the long-standing US alliance.

From Argentina and Chile to Ecuador and Bolivia, the left was in retreat. In Brazil, the country’s first female president, Dilma Rousseff, was ousted by rightwing foes. Exceptions were Nicaragua, where the veteran Sandinista Daniel Ortega was re-elected president; and Cuba, where the socialist regime hosted Barack Obama. His visit seemed to confirm the Cuban revolution’s survival after bitter US enmity, although Trump may try to turn the clock back. Fidel Castro, Cuba’s iconic leader, died. He was hailed as a historic figure and condemned as a tyrant. In Colombia, a peace deal with the Farc rebels was repudiated in a referendum, but continued to be honoured during a review. In Africa, Burundi’s president followed his Rwandan counterpart in overturning the constitution and grabbing a third consecutive term in office, causing considerable instability. In Uganda, Yoweri Museveni extended what looks like a presidency-for-life amid claims of poll fraud. In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, presidential elections were postponed, while the Gambia’s president, Yahya Jammeh, ceded electoral defeat, then refused to step down. Yet Africa’s democratic deficit was often unfairly exaggerated. In its 2016 report, Freedom House identified Nigeria, Liberia and Ivory Coast among countries experiencing big advances in political rights and civil liberties. It also praised Botswana, Ghana, Cape Verde and Benin. When Africans consider the US in 2017, the self-appointed champion of democracy, they may feel blessed. Next time a western politician complains about Robert Mugabe’s depredations in Zimbabwe, the ready reply will be: just look at Donald Trump.",diasaster:0},

{ "title":"Could online tutors and artificial intelligence be the future of teaching?", "content": "Ambar presses her hand to her forehead, nose crinkled in concentration as she considers the question on her screen: how many sevens in 91? The ten-year-old has been grappling with it for about a minute when she smiles: “13!”. Her tutor responds by posting a large smiley cat picture on her screen – the virtual equivalent of a pat on the back. He is sitting on the other side of the world in an online tutoring centre in India. Ambar, who attends Pakeman primary school in north London, is one of nearly 4,000 primary school children in Britain signed up for weekly one-to-one maths sessions with tutors based in India and Sri Lanka. The lessons, provided by a company called Third Space Learning, are targeted at pupils struggling with maths – particularly those from disadvantaged backgrounds. Can technology replace teachers? You asked Google – here’s the answer | Harpreet Purewal Read more From next year, the platform will become one of the first examples of artificial intelligence (AI) software being used to monitor, and ideally improve, teaching. Together with scientists at University College London (UCL), the company has analysed around 100,000 hours of audio and written data from its tutorials, with the goal of identifying what makes a good teacher and a successful lesson. Tom Hooper, the company’s CEO, said: “We’re looking to optimise lessons based on the knowledge we gain. We’ve recorded every lesson that we’ve ever done. By using the data, we’ve been trying to introduce AI to augment the teaching”. Initially, the company’s 300 tutors will receive real-time, automated interventions from the teaching software when it detects that a lesson may be veering off-course. Pupils on the programme have a 45-minute session with the same tutor each week. They communicate through a headset and a shared “whiteboard” (they can’t see each other). The lessons at Pakeman school are tailored to the individual, including visual rewards linked to the child’s interests. Premier League strikers for nearby Arsenal, cute animals and pink, iced doughnuts flash up on the screens of Ambar’s classmates. In addition to the raw audio data, each lesson has various success metrics attached: how many problems completed, how useful the pupil found the session, how the tutor rated it. Using machine learning algorithms to sift through the dataset, the UCL team has started to look for patterns. An early analysis found, perhaps unsurprisingly, that when tutors speak too quickly, the pupil is more likely to lose interest. Leaving sufficient time for the child to respond or pose their own questions was also found to be a factor in the lesson’s success, according to Hooper. These observations are likely to form the basis of the initial prompts that the tutors will receive, probably in the form of messages flashing up on their screen. “We’re going to be drip-feeding it in in relatively simple ways to start with,” said Hooper. As the technology evolves, the interventions could become more sophisticated and the software might play a more active role in teaching, raising questions about the extent to which intelligent software could replace human teachers. Rose Luckin, a professor of learner centred design at University College London, who is collaborating with Third Space Learning on the project, said: “What we are very interested in is the right blend of human and artificial intelligence in the classroom – identifying that sweet spot.” According to Luckin, AI provides a unique opportunity to assess which teaching strategies are working and to individualise teaching. “It would be able to say, for this child at the moment, Jolly Phonics is working well,” she said. “You would be able to look back over their reading process and see which interventions worked. The potential for the use of AI to make education tractable and visible is huge.” However, she predicts that the insights gleaned from AI will often be applied by human teachers. “What I’m really concerned about is that people don’t run away with the idea that kids have to be plugged into the computer,” she said. “It’s about so much more than that.” Hooper agreed that the aim is not to replace teachers with robots. “There’s a slightly dubious conversation about how AI will make humans irrelevant, but it’s not at all about replacing humans,” he said. “Our whole belief is that for children disengaged with the subject, who are lacking in confidence, people is what matter. An algorithm can’t provide that.” He said he does not expect his tutors, most of whom are science graduates, will be concerned about the automated feedback. “We’ll need to be considerate about it,” he said, adding that it would not be “a bossy algorithm barking orders at people”. Shazli Mahroof, 27, a tutor team leader based in Colombo, Sri Lanka, said he was not worried about being replaced by a teaching robot in the near future. “It’s not the computer who is going to teach,” he said. Online students and teachers are no different from the rest of academia Read more The tutors already have one lesson each week assessed by supervisors, and it is fairly obvious, subjectively, when things are progressing well, according to Hooper. “We’re asking ‘how do we promote those teaching events at scale?’” he said. Companies entering this sphere also need to convince parents and teachers that the data being collected is both secure and will ultimately benefit pupils. A previous data analytics project in New York state schools, run by the company InBloom, collapsed in 2014 after becoming embroiled in privacy concerns. “The whole thing became toxic,” said Luckin. “It’s really important that we do it right.” At Pakeman primary, it is the last maths session before the Christmas holidays. An infant class in the school hall is rehearsing a performance and the school has an end-of-term feeling in the air, but the atmosphere in the online learning session is one of hushed focus. After finishing the lesson, Ambar said that maths used to make her anxious, but since starting the weekly tutorials in Year 5, she has started enjoying it. “When they give you horrible sums, they help you,” she said. “I was scared to do it, but it was actually fun.”",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Pakistan transgender leader calls for end to culture of 'gurus'", "content": "A leader of Pakistan’s historic transgender community has called for an end to the culture of “gurus”, the leaders of transgender groups who take unwanted children into their care. Nadeem Kashish, the president of the Shemale Association for Fundamental Rights, says that, far from acting as guardians, the gurus encourage young transgender people to take up sex work. “We must eliminate the culture of handing over transgenders to gurus in childhood,” said Kashish. “They sexually abuse them and compel them to beg on the streets.” Known as hijras, a group including transgender people, cross-dressers and eunuchs, they have an ancient history in South Asia. They are mentioned in the pages of the Kama Sutra and served as senior courtiers to the subcontinent’s Mughal rulers in the 17th and 18th centuries. Pakistan’s transgender population is estimated at about 500,000, many of whom survive in a precarious social niche as wedding dancers and providers of blessings in exchange for cash – often from motorists stuck at traffic lights. In a highly conservative religious country they also suffer widespread abuse and discrimination. Last month, a two-minute video showing a group of men viciously beating a hijra was widely circulated on social media. In May, a hijra activist called Alisha died after being shot multiple times in Peshawar. Her friends claimed hospital staff failed to give her proper emergency medical care, in part because of objections to her being treated on a female ward. “The life of a transgender is hard,” said Kashish. “We are sexually assaulted, financially exploited and physically used.” Their position has improved in recent years after a series of historic rulings by the supreme court, including an order that they should be recognised as intersex on their national identity cards. Previously hijras had refused to declare themselves as male or female, meaning they were denied an ID card and therefore the right to vote and stand for election. The country’s provincial governments were also ordered to create jobs for hijras. Sindh province put a small number to work as municipal debt collectors who sing and dance outside the houses of defaulters to embarrass them into paying up. Pakistan's tax dodgers pay up when the hijra calls Read more But Kashish argues the community must also reform itself. She even calls for hijras to be banned from undergoing gender reassignment surgery, something many would like to do if they could afford it. Her warnings about the “guru” system have not been met with universal agreement. Sheeza, a guru in Rawalpindi who goes by one name, said he provided a vital safety net for young transgender people who would otherwise be abandoned by their parents. “I have no children so I treated them like my own kids,” he said. “When they were small and they came to my house I fed them. But now they are older I’ve told them to earn for themselves.” Bejili, 30, and one of six hijras in Sheeza’s group, said she had no help when she was thrown out of her home. “My guru loved me more than my parents,” she said. “It is only fair that I am helping him now that he is old.” In Islamabad, the hijra community is contributing towards the cost of a new mosque in a slum on the outskirts of the city. “We are not allowed to offer prayer in the same mosque as everyone else,” said Kashish. “Maulvis [expert in Islamic law] are not ready to lead our funeral prayers and our dead bodies are not properly buried. This new mosque will show the world that we are part of the same community.” Kashish is hoping to stand in the next national election for one of the parliamentary seats reserved for “minorities”. “When I’m elected I will start building homes that will provide shelter, education and health facilities to the transgenders,” Kashish said. “And I will run an awareness campaign asking parents not to hand over their child to gurus.”",diasaster:0},

Instead I looked at the map, for new places where the river touches the land. How many find country by looking near roads? But roads go where we wanted them to: the river goes where it has always gone. One place caught my eye, a place called Spring Woods. Not for spring like the season, but for a series of springs rising on the river’s northern bank, away from roads on a bend where the Welland leaves Stamford, thins, and starts to slink. It’s a weird morning. The air is silvered by a quickening mist and a sun so diffused I can look straight at it. Briefly it seems to sink as the mist boils over it, as if it’s setting, not rising. The sun’s gone as I set out. The river’s below, brown and messy-banked from rain. This path alone is a find: winter-dead trees stand either side and entwine above. Like walking through a ribcage.

{ "title":"Owen Smith: frustrated and disappointed but hopeful for the future", "content": "Owen Smith still receives death threats following his unsuccessful challenge to Jeremy Corbyn for the Labour leadership last summer but, as the Pontypridd MP reflects on 2016, he has no regrets. “I’m proud that I showed the leadership to challenge and to seek to revive the Labour party,” he says, sitting bolt upright at the table in his quiet Westminster office. Smith was soundly beaten by Corbyn, and has deliberately stayed out of the public eye since September, after a bruising contest that saw his past as a special adviser for the Blair government, and a lobbyist for drugs company Pfizer, raked over for evidence that he was a “red Tory”. “Jeremy won a big and clear victory, and I made it very clear all summer as to what I thought the issues were and why I thought I was a better bet to lead the Labour party back to power than Jeremy. Clearly the majority of the membership didn’t agree with me and, therefore, I didn’t think I needed to inflict myself on them any more,” he says. “They’d seen lots of me all summer long and they’d probably had a guts full of me.” The fate of the MPs who plotted a coup against Corbyn Read more He has not spoken to Corbyn since he stepped off the stage in Liverpool after the results were announced at the start of the party’s annual conference in September. But asked whether he has any regrets about throwing his hat in the ring – and knocking out Angela Eagle, who had been the first to declare – he says: “No, because that would have been cowardly and it wouldn’t have been showing leadership. “I think I can look back with respect to myself at having said, very clearly, what I thought about our party, its past and its future.” Some of Eagle’s supporters still feel Smith should have thrown his weight behind her and they point out that she suffered intense personal abuse for being the first to put her head above the parapet. But he says: “Angela was, yes, brave to challenge; but I think we both took a lot of flak over the summer.” Facebook Twitter Pinterest Angela Eagle was the first Labour MP to put forward a challenge to Corbyn’s leadership. Photograph: Graeme Robertson for the Guardian He repeats his insistence that he was never involved in any coup and was not contacted by the shadow ministers who took part in a wave of resignations in the days after the Brexit vote. He also admits that many Labour members, particularly those who had joined to back Corbyn, believed he had not been given long enough to make his mark on the party. “The reality is, I think we stumbled – others stumbled, truthfully – into the challenge to Jeremy.” Asked why he believes Corbyn inspires such passionate loyalty, he says: “I think in part it is a rejection of New Labour, and there is a visceral sense among many in the party, old and new members, that New Labour wasn’t radical enough and New Labour wasn’t Labour enough. “That’s definitely out there and felt by many, many people. I think there was also just a human, emotional reaction to the notion that Jeremy was being unfairly challenged.” He adds that efforts by the party’s national executive committee to prevent new members from voting, which led to a legal challenge, “compounded the narrative that this was an attempt by the parliamentary Labour party, which is sort of like a swear word these days in the party, to undermine Jeremy.” In the event, Smith won the support of two-thirds of members who had been part of Labour for more than a year, but Corbyn thrashed him among new recruits. As 2016 began, Smith was settling into his role as shadow work and pensions spokesman and enjoying needling his opposite number, Iain Duncan Smith, over tax credit cuts and the cruelties of the benefits regime. He was regarded by colleagues as a good communicator with a bright future, but few would have expected that by the summer, he would be crisscrossing Britain in a campaign bus bidding to dislodge Corbyn. Both major parties were plunged into turmoil by the referendum result, but such was the Conservatives’ ruthless efficiency at stabbing each other in the back – or, in Andrea Leadsom’s case, shooting herself in the foot – that their leadership crisis was resolved in early July, in plenty of time for MPs to head off for a restorative summer break. There was no vacancy for Labour leader but the simmering discontent with Corbyn’s leadership exploded into open revolt after the EU referendum. The result was a deeply personal race, which lasted until September. Smith says now that he was not surprised at the attacks he endured, but thinks the tone of debate in the party has become more strident. “Part of the big difference was definitely social media and the extent to which Jeremy supporters were very, very active, and very aggressive on social media,” he says. “I think they did very effectively play the man as well as the ball.” And he confirms that he is still receiving a rough ride. “I had police at my surgery last Friday because of some of the death threats I’ve had,” he admits. “Some of those are to do with the contest and some of those are to do with other political things I’ve said.” During the summer, he says he had “lots and lots” of death threats. Asked how that felt, he says, with a clipped laugh: “A bit miserable.” Now Smith says he is ready to return to the fray, in a modest way at least, cooperating with backbench colleagues to formulate some of the policies a future Labour government might need, particularly on tax reform. “One of the glaring examples of weakness on the left is the fact that we have not really engaged in any meaningful debate about reform of taxation in this country,” he says. “The one big step that Labour took in the 1990s and 2000s was the introduction of tax credits but, other than that really, we left tax untouched and it’s the biggest tool in the state’s armoury. It’s the most important underpinning of everything you can do.” Facebook Twitter Pinterest Jeremy Corbyn comprehensively beat Smith in the summer’s leadership contest. Photograph: Joe Giddens/PA He talks about the need for the left to rethink the role of the state and how best to tame unfettered markets. Smith is careful not to be too openly critical of the current shadow frontbench. But it is clear his plans emerge partly from a concern that, while Corbyn and his colleagues style themselves as radicals, their detailed policies do not always match that rhetoric. “We need to have specific, concrete ideas that people see are credible and up to the scale of the task we face today,” he says. “One of the things I can help do behind the scenes is think about those things and convene discussions about it.” Choosing his words carefully, he welcomes Corbyn’s improved performance at prime minister’s questions, which has been widely remarked upon in Westminster. “I think he’s definitely done better at PMQs; he’s been much sharper at PMQs, more forensic, and pursued a single theme more effectively, so I think that’s really encouraging.” But it is clear that he stands by the apocalyptic picture he painted back in the summer, of a political party peering into the abyss. “Anybody who looks at modern politics, across the world, and thinks that parties can’t disappear, is looking with their eyes closed. It can absolutely happen. As I said over the summer, parties take a long time to rise, but history shows they can disappear overnight. He believes the Brexit vote was a response to long-term changes to society and the economy that will make it harder for Labour to unite its traditional supporters. “The ability Labour had previously to forge a coalition, in those more homogenous communities, has been in decline for a long period. Brexit shone a light on that, it highlighted those fissures, but it’s deeper-rooted than that, I fear.” Despite his bleak mood, however, Smith has no intention of following the example of Copeland MP and fellow Corbyn-sceptic Jamie Reed, who announced just before Christmas that he was stepping down from parliament. “I’m frustrated and disappointed that I didn’t win and I’m frustrated and disappointed that we’re still at a low ebb, but I’m hopeful that we can revive and I’m hopeful that I can continue to play a part.”",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Germany moves to atone for 'forgotten genocide' in Namibia", "content": "It has become known as the first genocide of the 20th century: tens of thousands of men, women and children shot, starved, and tortured to death by German troops as they put down rebellious tribes in what is now Namibia. For more than a century the atrocities have been largely forgotten in Europe, and often in much of Africa too. Now a series of events – and a policy U-turn by Berlin – is raising the international profile of the massacre of Herero and Namaqua peoples and bringing justice for their descendants a little closer. Negotiations between the German and Namibian governments over possible reparation payments are expected to be completed and result in an official apology before next June. In Berlin a major new exhibition about the country’s bloody colonial history opened earlier this winter. It features letters from missionaries expressing their concerns about concentration camps and killings in Germany’s south-west African colony. In the US activists have hired lawyers to pressure the United Nations. Elsewhere there are plays exploring the tragic story and displays of photography at high-profile contemporary art fairs. In 1884, as European powers scrambled to carve up Africa, Berlin moved to annex a new colony on the south-west coast of the continent. Land was confiscated, livestock plundered and native people subjected to racially motivated violence, rape and murder. In January 1904, the Herero people – also called the Ovaherero – rebelled. More than a hundred German civilians were killed. The smaller Nama tribe joined the uprising the following year. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Troops in German south-west Africa (now Namibia) at the time of the Herero revolt of 1904. Photograph: Three Lions/Getty Images Colonial rulers responded without mercy. Tens of thousands of Herero were forced into the Kalahari desert, their wells poisoned and food supplies cut. Gen Lothar von Trotha, sent to quell the revolt, ordered his men to shoot “any Herero, with or without a rifle, with or without cattle”. “I do not accept women or children either: drive them back to their people or shoot them,” he told his troops. The order was rescinded but other measures were employed that were equally lethal. Those who had survived were rounded up and placed in concentration camps, where they were beaten and worked to death in squalid conditions. Half of the total Nama population were also killed, dying in disease-ridden death camps such the infamous site on Shark Island, in the coastal town of Lüderitz. By 1908, only 16,000 remained, historians say. I do not accept women or children either: drive them back to their people or shoot them General Lothar von Trotha As many as 3,000 Herero skulls were sent to Berlin for German scientists to examine for signs that they were of racially inferior peoples. “We are talking now about the lives that were lost, the land that was taken, the cattle that was killed, the rape, the lost dignity, the culture that was destroyed. We cannot even speak our language,” said Esther Muinjangue, a Herero activist and social worker at the University of Namibia, in Windhoek, the capital. Thousands of women were systematically raped, often taken as “wives” by settlers. “My great-great-grandfather was German. This relationship was not of love, but a product of force,” Muinjangue added. Ongoing struggle The issue has long caused tensions in Namibia, where farmers descended from the original German settlers still own land seized from local people. The Herero, who make up about 10% of Namibia’s population of 2.3 million, say they never regained a fraction of their former prosperity. “We live in overcrowded, overgrazed and overpopulated reserves – modern-day concentration camps – while our fertile grazing areas are occupied by the descendants of the perpetrators of the genocide against our ancestors. If Germany pays reparation then the Ovaherero can buy back the land that was illegally confiscated from us through the force of arms,” said Veraa Katuuo, a US-based activist. Resentment has been rising for years. Earlier this year red paint was poured over a German colonial monument in the town of Swakopmund. Map Germany was forced out of the colony in 1915, but the killings there and in its territories on the east coast of the continent are seen by some historians as important steps towards the Holocaust in Europe during the second world war. In Germany, debate around the country’s colonial project has long been overshadowed by the crimes of the National Socialist era. While most German cities commemorate the victims of the Nazi period, there are no significant monuments to the victims of German colonialism. Other than a memorial stone in a cemetery in Berlin’s Neukölln district and a statue of an elephant in Bremen, no permanent display currently bears testament to the genocide of the Herero. German officials rejected the use of the word “genocide” to describe the killings of the Herero and Namaqua until July 2015, when the Social Democrat foreign minister, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, issued a “political guideline” indicating that the massacre should be referred to as “a war crime and a genocide”. But there are still strict limits. German chief negotiator Ruprecht Polenz told The Guardian that personal reparations to relatives of Herero and Namaqua victims were “out of the question”. His position has angered senior Herero and Nama leaders, and a meeting in Windhoek in November ended with representatives of the Nama genocide committee storming out of the German embassy after Polenz said that massacre in south-west Africa was “incomparable” to the Holocaust. “We understand that the German government is proposing an apology without reparations. If that is the case, it would constitute a phenomenal insult to the intelligence not only of Namibians and the descendants of the victim communities, but Africans in general, and in fact to humanity … It would represent the most insensitive political statement ever to have been made by an aggressor nation to the victims of its genocide,” said Vekuii Rukoro, the paramount chief of the Herero. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Visitors look at a wall of postcards that form part of the the exhibition, German Colonialism: Fragments of its History and Present, at the German Historical Museum. Photograph: Carsten Koall/Getty Images Instead of direct payments, German negotiators have proposed setting up a foundation for youth exchanges with Namibia and funding various infrastructure projects, such as vocational training centres, housing developments and solar power stations. But this means bilateral discussions between the Namibian government and Berlin, without Herero or Namaqua participation. Herero representatives say they are being marginalised. “Development aid never goes to the Herero or Namaqua areas,” said Festus Muundjua, secretary for foreign affairs of the Ovaherero Traditional Authority. Another key issue is the return of human remains stolen by the Germans. Twenty skulls were returned in 2011 to be welcomed by warriors on horseback, ululations and tears. Hundreds, perhaps thousands, remained. ‘Uncomfortable thesis’ Jürgen Zimmerer, a historian at Hamburg University and consultant to the new exhibition, argued that “colonial amnesia” had created a warped perspective on later German crimes in the 20th century. “If you focus only on the 30 years of imperial Germany’s excursions into Africa, then of course the story pales in comparison to the colonial histories of other European nations, such as Britain or Belgium,” Zimmerer said. “But it’s important to see Germany’s history in Africa as continuous with its better-known dark chapters in the 30s and 40s. In Africa, Germany experimented with the criminal methods it later applied during the Third Reich, for example through … the colonisation of eastern and central Europe … There is a trend among the public to view the Nazi period as an aberration of an otherwise enlightened history. But engaging with our colonial history confronts us with a more uncomfortable thesis.” Recent historical works have highlighted the links between the fate of the Herero and Nama, and that of European Jews. Ideas and techniques that would play a key role in the Holocaust have some of their roots in German atrocities in colonial Africa, researchers argue. Other former colonial powers have been deeply reluctant to acknowledge the violence associated with their imperial history. Belgium has never officially recognised the cost of its invasion and exploitation of Congo, where about 10 million people – roughly half the country’s population – are thought to have died during its rule. The Hereros and the Namas of Namibia will never … declare ceasefire with generations of German governments to come Vekuii Rukoro In 2013 the UK government reluctantly offered “sincere regret” and £2,600 each to about 5,000 Kenyans imprisoned and tortured during the Mau Mau rebellion in the former colony in the 1950s. A video of Indian politician Shashi Tharoor demanding a token £1 reparation to India from the UK at the Oxford Union attracted more than 3m views on YouTube last year, and earned an endorsement from Narendra Modi, the Indian prime minister. “Reparations payments to Namibia could set a precedent for Belgium and the Congo, France and Algeria or Great Britain and the history of the slave trade. Descendants of the Herero know that too,” Zimmerer, the historian, said. Some experts have argued reparations would be impractical. Rukoro, the Herero chief, rejected what he called Germany’s “chequebook diplomacy” and bilateral dealings with the Namibian government. “Guess what: the Hereros and the Namas of Namibia will never … declare ceasefire with generations of German governments to come. Our war will continue,” he said.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Screen-based lifestyle harms children’s health", "content": "A decade ago our first multiple-signatory “toxic childhood” press letter described how children’s health and wellbeing were being undermined by the decline of outdoor play, increasingly screen-based lifestyles, a hyper-competitive schooling system and the unremitting commercialisation of childhood. Despite widespread public concern, subsequent policymaking has been half-hearted, short-termist and disjointedly ineffective. The above factors continue to affect children adversely, with “school and cool” displacing active, self-directed play at an ever-earlier age. Physical health problems like obesity continue to escalate, and mental health problems among children and young people are approaching crisis levels. As well as the intense distress caused to families, there are obviously longer-term social and economic consequences for society as a whole. Experts call for official guidelines on child screen use Read more If children are to develop the self-regulation and emotional resilience required to thrive in modern technological culture, they need unhurried engagement with caring adults and plenty of self-directed outdoor play, especially during their early years (0–7). We therefore urge the government to take immediate action, including: • The development of a coherent, well-funded approach to care and education from pre-birth to age seven, including a kindergarten stage for three- to seven-year-olds emphasising social and emotional development and outdoor play. • National guidelines on screen-based technology for children up to the age of 12, produced by recognised authorities in child health and development. We also recommend the appointment of a cabinet-level minister for children, remaining in post for a full parliament, whose department audits all government policies for their impact on children’s health and wellbeing; or as an absolute minimum, the setting up of a non-party-political standing conference on children’s health and wellbeing, meeting and reporting regularly to parliament. Without concerted action, our children’s physical and mental health will continue to deteriorate, with long-term results for UK society that are frankly unthinkable.

{ "title":"Dozens of UK banks and financial firms 'looking at moving to Ireland'", "content": "Banks and financial institutions make up the overwhelming majority of more than 100 companies inquiring about relocating to Ireland after Brexit, the head of the agency tasked with bringing foreign investment into the republic has confirmed. Martin Shanahan, the chief executive of the Industrial Development Agency (IDA), said many of the corporations looking to move were based in the City of London. Shanahan said that while Ireland would try to make capital out of the UK voting to leave the EU, Brexit was not the outcome he or anyone else in Ireland favoured. He also said the IDA did not fear a Trump presidency would shut down American multinational investment into Ireland. The IDA has a target to create an extra 80,000 jobs in the country by 2019, many of them from new US firms setting up their European base in Ireland. Shanahan told the Guardian that Ireland’s low 12.5% corporation tax remained sacrosanct as one of the Irish Republic’s key fiscal policies. Ireland will be the only English speaking country left in the EU after Brexit, giving Shanahan and his IDA colleagues extra impetus in their attempts to woo companies, some of which are based in the UK. He said: “We have seen a huge increase in the amount of inquiries and activities across the globe. It’s not just our office in London, or our office in Dublin; we are receiving inquiries in Asia, in the US, in New York in particular. The figure that we have used to date is over 100 related inquiries.” Shanahan continued: “For the financial services sector it is the fact that they need to have access to the European market and they need a jurisdiction in which they can do that. Ireland is extremely attractive because we are English speaking, have a common law system, there is the close proximity to the UK.” On the threat of Trump imposing protectionist barriers to US companies locating abroad, the IDA chief executive said: “US companies, in my view, will continue to want to … go abroad, seek new markets, seek the talent that exists abroad and have access to the innovation and research that exists outside the US. I don’t see any kind of scenario where that isn’t the case.” Shanahan stressed that the instability and uncertainty of global politics, from Brexit to Trump’s election win, might actually benefit Ireland. “In the context of a very turbulent world Ireland looks very stable economically because of the strong growth in 2014, 2015, and it looks the same in 2016. And we look very stable from an enterprise and policy perspective as well.” Despite criticism from fellow EU nations such as France that Ireland operates sweetheart tax deals for some of the biggest corporations on the planet, Shanahan predicted there would be no change to the 12.5% corporation tax regime. “Investors place great store in the fact that Ireland has been unwavering and consistent. They know exactly what they are getting, the fact that it is 12.5%. I do not see any circumstances, and this has been confirmed by the minister for finance, Michael Noonan, that it will change any time in the near future, or even the long-term future for that matter,” he said.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Landlord forced to submit 140 applications to prove flats are lawful", "content": "A London council’s fight against unfit rented housing has resulted in a single landlord being forced to submit 140 applications to prove his apartments are lawful accommodation. The extent of the continuing four-year battle between Islington council and Andrew Panayi, a multimillionaire landlord who owns 200 flats around Caledonian Road in north London, has been revealed by officials who told the Guardian that in one year they discovered 90 of his flats did not have adequate planning permission. Islington estimates investigations and official challenges to Panayi’s practices have cost council tax payers at least £170,000, with some cases taking up to two years to resolve. For a period of time one council planning officer was assigned no other work apart from investigating the landlord, it said. “There are literally hundreds of files [on Panayi],” said Karen Sullivan, Islington’s planning director. “There is no one else at this scale.” The town hall’s investigation into Panayi’s rental empire has seen him served with enforcement notices on more than two dozen bedsits – described by one tenant as “worse than prison cells” – that were ruled unfit for use because they were too small. Since the beginning of 2015 he has been successfully prosecuted twice for failing to respond to contravention and enforcement notices on rental properties. He is due to appear in court in February for sentencing in a third case after he refused to demolish an unauthorised roof extension in which he had built two rental flats. Facebook Twitter Pinterest London flats ‘worse than prison cells’ But Panayi, 69, a former insolvency practitioner, has hit back at his treatment by the council, telling the Guardian it amounts to “victimisation”. In an image that suggests he thinks Islington considers him like a vampire, he said the council “brings out the crucifix when they hear my name”. In 2016, the council refused all but one of his planning applications to alter properties, he said. But Panayi has also won many of his battles with the council. Ninety-six of the 140 planning applications he has had to submit to prove his apartments are lawful have been successful and he has won 13 appeals against some of those that were refused. He believes he is misunderstood and claims to have pioneered low-cost housing in the area in the 1980s by turning large single houses into multiple flats. “The services I have provided on the Caledonian Road have been so great that they should not be coming after me, they should be giving me a prize,” he said. “It has a lot to do with the fact that I have been so successful. They just can’t accept it. “Anything I touch comes out as invalidated or refused. It is revenge in a big way.” This month alone Panayi had three planning appeals rejected and the reasons given reveal two key reasons why officials have been objecting to his approach to housing on an almost industrial scale. In one case he wanted to split two flats into four by building an extension, but the government’s planning inspector ruled three of them were significantly smaller than minimum space standards, would be “cramped” and would fail to provide acceptable living conditions. In another case, it emerged that Panayi did not want to provide a £50,000 payment towards affordable housing, as demanded by the borough. Since 2014 he has been convicted, and had to repay £70,000 under the Proceeds of Crime Act, for letting out a storage basement as self-contained accommodation for £975 a month after it was declared substandard. In 2014 Islington sent in health and safety inspectors after it emerged he was trying to rent out a studio apartment that consisted of a small room into which had been crammed a double mattress, a wardrobe and some kitchen units, leaving just enough room to open the front door or walk round the bed, plus a separate toilet and shower. Panayi’s notoriety grew when he appeared in a 2012 BBC documentary, The Secret History of Our Streets, in which he spoke about “milking” tenants and boasted he “builds first and asks permission later”. By 2014 Panayi had acquired 250 rental properties which delivered him a multimillion-pound annual income. Local residents, who branded themselves the Cally Cows in reference to his “milking” quote, were furious at his tactics and councillors decided to act. “When the programme aired there was national outrage,” said Andrew Marx, Islington’s deputy head of planning. “People from Manchester were asking, ‘What are you doing down there?’ It was a huge thing for us as a council wanting to care about people having decent accommodation. Four years later we are still pursuing this, which shows we are not going to stop.” Councillor Diarmaid Ward, Islington council’s executive member for housing and development, said: “More and more people in Islington are renting privately, and they need decent homes to live in. It’s also important that public confidence in the planning system is not undermined by people who flout planning controls. Most landlords in Islington act fairly and lawfully, but if landlords ignore planning rules we will take action, especially if landlords break the rules repeatedly.”",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Bionic legs and smart slacks: exoskeletons that could enhance us all", "content": "Wearing an £80,000 exoskeleton, Sophie Morgan is half woman, half robot. Beneath her feet are two metal plates, and at her hand a digital display, a joystick and, somewhat alarmingly, a bright red emergency button. As she pushes the joystick forward, the bionic legs take their first steps – a loud, industrial whirring strikes up and her right foot is raised, extended and placed forward. Her left slowly follows. As she looks up, a smile spreads across her face. Exoskeletons, touted as devices that will allow the injured to walk, elderly people to remain independent for longer, the military to get more from soldiers and even turn all of us into mechanically enhanced humans, have captured the imagination of researchers across the world, from startups to Nasa. For now, the most obvious – and tangible – application has involved allowing paralysed people to stand and walk. “It was a mixture of surrealism and just absolute, just the most exhilarating feeling,” says Morgan, describing her first experience of the technology four years ago. Now 31, the artist, model and presenter of Channel 4’s 2016 Paralympic coverage was paralysed in a car accident aged 18 and has used a wheelchair ever since. The idea to try the exoskeleton, she says, came from the BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner, who uses a wheelchair after being shot while reporting from Saudi Arabia. The exoskeleton, from Rex Bionics, offered a life-changing experience, according to Morgan. “It had been 10 years, give or take, since I had properly stood, so that was in itself quite overwhelming,” she says. The impact was far reaching. “It is not just about the joy of ‘Oh, I am standing’. It is the difference it makes, the way you feel afterwards, psychologically and physiologically – it is immeasurable.” Returning to her wheelchair, says Morgan, is a disappointing experience. “I am walking in my dreams, so it does blur that line – that liminal space between real and dream, and reality and fantasy,” she says of the device. The exoskeleton isn’t just about stirring excitement. As Morgan points out, there are myriad health problems associated with sitting for long periods of time. A report co-commissioned by Public Health England and published last year highlighted findings showing that, compared with those up and about the most, individuals who spend the longest time sitting are around twice as likely to develop type 2 diabetes and have a 13% higher risk of developing cancer. Wheelchair users, adds Morgan, also face side-effects, from pressure sores to urinary tract infections. “It could be the difference between longevity and not for people like me,” she says of the exoskeleton. The competition About 40 of the Rex Bionic devices are currently in use worldwide, including in rehabilitation centres, says Richard Little, co-founder of the company. An engineer, Little says he was inspired to develop the system after his best friend and co-founder was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. But there is competition. As Little points out, the development of battery technology, processing power and components has brought a number of exoskeletons on to the market in recent years, including those from the US-based companies ReWalk and Ekso Bionics. “[They] offer a whole load of different things which are similar in some ways but different in others,” says Little. “[Ours] doesn’t use crutches,” he points out, adding that the innovation removes the risk of users inadvertently damaging their shoulders, and frees their arms. There are tantalising signs that exoskeletons could do more than just aid rehabilitation or increase the mobility options for those who have experienced a stroke or spinal cord injury. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Sophie Morgan walks with the aid of Rex. Photograph: Teri Pengilley for the Guardian While the bionic legs tried by Morgan are pre-programmed, researchers have developed exoskeletons controlled by a non-invasive system linked to the brain, allowing an even wider range of wheelchair users to walk. What’s more, when combined with virtual reality and tactile feedback, the systems even appear to promote a degree of recovery for people with paraplegia. “All our patients got some degree of neurological recovery, which has never been documented in spinal cord injury,” says Miguel Nicolelis, co-director of Duke University’s centre for neuroengineering, who led the work. It’s a development that excites Little, whose team have also been exploring the possibility of thought control with their own device. Yet despite their transformative capabilities, the limitations of such bulky exoskeletons have left many frustrated. Tim Swift, co-founder of the US startup Roam Robotics and one of the original researchers behind the exoskeleton from Ekso Bionics, is one of them. “It is a 50lb machine that costs $100,000 and has a half-mile-an-hour speed and can’t turn,” he says of his former work. “There are only so many applications where that makes sense. This is not a shift towards consumer, this is a hunt for somewhere we can actually use the technologies we are making.” The dream, says Swift, is to create affordable devices that could turn us all into superhumans, augmenting our abilities by merging the biological with state of the art devices to unleash a new, improved, wave of soldiers, workers, agile pensioners and even everyday hikers. But in devising the underpinning technology, he says it is time to ditch the motors and metal approach that he himself pioneered. While hefty, rigid devices can support someone with paraplegia, says Swift, such exoskeletons are too heavy and costly for wider applications – such as helping a runner go faster. The fundamental challenge, he adds, is to create a device that remains powerful while keeping the weight down. “I think you have two solutions,” he says. The first is to develop a new, lightweight system that efficiently uses battery energy to generate movement. The second, he says, is to stick with metals and motors but be more intelligent in how you use them. Swift’s answer is based on the former – but it hasn’t received universal acclaim. “I have spent the last two and a half years literally getting laughed out of conferences when I tell people we are going to make inflated exoskeletons,” he says. “People think it is a running joke.” But Swift is adamant that to produce a system that can be used in myriad ways to augment humans, be it on the building site, in the home or up a mountain, technologists must innovate. And air, he believes, is the way to do it. The result, so far, is a series of proof-of-concept devices, braces that look a little like padded shin-guards, that can be strapped on to arms or legs. “The fundamentals allow you to have extremely lightweight structures [and] extremely low cost because everything is basically plastics and fabrics as opposed to precision machined metals,” he says. And there is another boon. “Because you can make something that is very lightweight without sacrificing power, you are actually increasing the power density, which creates these opportunities to do highly dynamic behaviours.” In other words, according to Swift, exoskeletons made of inflated fabric could not only boost a human’s walking abilities, but also help them run, jump or even climb. “When I say I want someone to go into Footlocker and buy a shoe that makes them run 25% faster – [we are] actively looking at things that look like that,” he says. Others agree with Swift about the need to reduce the clunkiness of exoskeletons, but take a different approach. Augmenting humans Hugh Herr is a rock climber, engineer and head of the biomechatronics research group at MIT. A double amputee, the result of a climbing accident on Mount Washington, Herr has pioneered the development of bionic limbs, inventing his own in the process. But it was in 2014 that his team became the first to make an all-important breakthrough: creating a powered, autonomous exoskeleton that could reduce the energy it took a human to walk. “No one is going to want to wear an exoskeleton if it is a fancy exercise machine, if it makes you sweat more and work harder, what is the point?” says Herr. “My view is if an exoskeleton fails to reduce metabolism, one needs to start over and go back to the drawing board.” Facebook Twitter Pinterest Hugh Herr. Photograph: Alamy To boost our bodies, says Herr, it is necessary to break the challenge down. “We are taking a first principle approach, and joint by joint understanding deeply what has to be done scientifically and technologically to augment a human,” he says. For Herr the future is not inflatables (“pneumatics tend to be very inefficient,” he says) but minimalistic, stripping away the mass of conventional exoskeletons so that the device augments, rather than weighs down, the wearer. “If you separated the device from the human, it can’t even uphold its own weight,” he says. The approach, he adds, was to focus on the area of the body with biggest influence when it came to walking, “Arguably the most important muscle to bipedal human gait is the calf muscle,” he says. “So we said in a minimalist design [with] minimal weight and mass, one arguably should build an artificial calf muscle.” Boasting sensors for position, speed and force for feedback, and programmed to move and respond in a natural way, the device drives the foot forward, saving the wearer energy on each step. “Our artificial calf muscle pushes the human in just the right time in the gait cycle where the human is most inefficient and after that period gets out of the way completely,” he says. Herr isn’t alone in focusing on such minimalist ankle-based devices. Among other pioneers is Conor Walsh at Harvard University who has created similar exoskeletons to help stroke patients walk. The devices are a million miles from the cumbersome bionic legs with with Morgan walked across the office, but then Herr believes the future for exoskeletons lies firmly with the augmented human. “In the future when a person is paralysed, they won’t use an exoskeleton. The reason is we are going to understand how to repair tissues,” he says. “The only time to use an exoskeleton is if you want to go beyond what the muscles are capable of, beyond innate physicality.” Making them look like second skins and behave like second skins is going to happen In Bristol, Jonathan Rossiter is hoping to do just that with an even bolder approach: smart materials. “Fabrics and textiles and rubbers is a really good description of the things we are looking at,” he says. Professor of robotics at Bristol University and head of the Soft Robotics group at Bristol Robotics Laboratory, Rossiter believes exoskeletons of the future will look more like a pair of trousers. “Making them look like second skins and actually behave like second skins is going to happen,” he says. The technology behind it, says Rossiter, will be hi-tech materials: rubbers that bend when electricity is applied, or fabrics that move in response to light, for example. “We build up from the materials to the mechanisms,” he says. Conscious of an ageing population, Rossiter believes a pair of smart trousers will prove invaluable in keeping people independent for longer, from helping them out of chairs to allowing them to walk that bit further. But he too sees them becoming popular gadgets, helping hikers clamber up mountains. There is, however, a hitch. Scaling up smart materials from the tiny dimensions explored in the lab to a full-blown set of slacks is no small feat. “You are taking something which is [a] nanomaterial. You have to fabricate it so that it layers up nicely, it doesn’t have any errors in it, it doesn’t have any fractures or anything else and see if you can transpose that into something you can wear,” says Rossiter. In short, it will be a few seasons yet before your wardrobe will be boasting some seriously smart legwear. But as technology marches on, the dream gets closer to reality. Herr, for one, believes commercial devices are a hop, skip and a jump away – arriving within the next two decades. “Imagine if you had leg exoskeletons where you could traverse across very, very irregular natural surfaces, natural terrains with a dramatically reduced metabolism and an increased speed while you are jumping over logs and hopping from rock to rock, going up and down mountains,” he says, conjuring up a scene of a bionic, human gazelle. “When that device exists in the world, no one will ever use the mountain bike again.”",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Supermarkets to fly in emergency salad from US after Spanish floods", "content": "Supermarkets are preparing to fly in emergency salad from the US after heavy rains and flooding in Spain hit supplies. About 80% of fresh produce – including leafy salads as well as celery and broccoli – sold in the UK at this time of year comes from the Murcia region in southern Spain. Suppliers spoken to by the Guardian said yields in the region had dropped to as low as 30% of those expected at this time of year on some crops, such as little gem lettuces, as farmers’ fields were inundated last weekend. Celery yields have dropped to 40% of normal levels while some citrus crops, including satsumas and clementines, have also been affected. “There has been a deluge of flooding in that part of Spain and they have got blocked roads, flooded dispatch facilities and mobile rigs for picking as well as crops that have been washed away,” said Anthony Gardiner of G’s, a major supplier to the supermarkets with operations in the UK and Spain. He said the past week had been “incredibly challenging” and that supply difficulties could last for weeks. This week farmers have struggled to access fields and organise deliveries amid heavy flooding that had left roads and some workers’ homes deluged. But the loss of newly planted seedlings means there is likely to be further shortages into January and February, just as Brits seek out salad for their new year health kick. One wholesaler said some supermarkets were planning to fly in stock from the US and at least one supermarket confirmed it would do so. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Flooded streets in the village of Los Alcázares in Murcia, Spain. Photograph: Marcial Guillen/EPA “These have been among the worst downpours we have seen since these farms were established in the 1980s,” a spokeswoman for the British Leafy Salads Association told trade journal the Grocer. “The rainfall has been so intense that the ground is saturated and there is nowhere for the excess water to go.” Andy Weir at Reynolds, which supplies national restaurant chains including Pizza Express and Carluccio’s, said: “We have managed to maintain availability as we buy from contracted growers and they have pulled out all the stops. There is a massive shortage in the market and if you don’t have a contract of supply you will struggle.” He said difficulty in organising new planting to replace lost seedlings was likely to mean salad supply problems would emerge again in February and March when those crops should be harvested. Some supermarkets including Sainsbury’s and Aldi had signs up warning shoppers they were experiencing salad shortages ahead of Christmas. A spokesperson for Sainsbury’s said: “There has been limited supply of our iceberg and gem lettuce due to weather conditions in Spain but deliveries to stores are now taking place. We are doing all we can to ensure customers can buy the lettuce of their choice for Christmas and Boxing Day.” Aldi said it was experiencing shortages in some areas, but Tesco and Morrisons said they had no serious shortages.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"'A new generation of art lovers should see the genius of Sidney Nolan'", "content": "There was a time when Sidney Nolan was one of the best-known artists in the world, yet mention his name in the UK today and there might be a vague flicker of recognition. But more likely a shrug of the shoulders. “It is really hard to imagine just how famous Sidney Nolan was,” said former journalist David Lipsey, now a Labour peer. “He was a man absolutely at the forefront of art and painting. And yet I meet people now, people who have gone to art college for God’s sake, who haven’t heard of him. I say I’m the chair of the Sidney Nolan Trust and they look at you … ” Next year could be when all that changes. It will be the centenary of Nolan’s birth and the trust is determined to restore a reputation which has, in the UK at least, fallen off many radars. “We are trying to put him back where we feel that he belongs,” said Anthony Plant, trust director. “All the galleries we talk to, the Royal Academy, Pallant House, they say, ‘Yes, Nolan!’ People say, ‘Why isn’t this guy being exhibited all the time?’ We’ve been pushing at an open door, really. He was, no doubt, a genius and it is about allowing a new generation to see that.” Facebook Twitter Pinterest Picture of Sidney Nolan, the Rodd, Herefordshire. Photograph: Dimitris Legakis/Athena Pictures Nolan was born in Melbourne in 1917 and brought up on the city’s rough working-class streets. His breakthrough as an artist came with his remarkable series of paintings inspired by the outlaw Ned Kelly, made between 1945-47, now recognised as being among the most famous images of all Australian art. He is revered in the nation of his birth, but little remembered in the nation of his death. He moved to London in 1953 and was championed by the art historian and Civilisation presenter Kenneth Clark, developed a strong friendship with Benjamin Britten and later became one of the few artists to be both knighted and awarded an Order of Merit by the Queen. Sidney Nolan: little-known Opera Australia paintings hark back to golden age of the arts Read more Next year’s plans include exhibitions at Pallant House in Chichester, the Ikon in Birmingham, the British Museum and the Australian high commission, where four late spray-painted abstracts will be reunited for the first time since his death. There will also be symposiums on his life, work and legacy at King’s College London and the Royal Academy of Arts. Events will kick off on 26 January, Australia Day, with the launch of Nolan 100, an online collection of examples from his vast output, selected by collectors, artists, curators, critics, friends and family. In 1983, Nolan and his wife acquired the Rodd, an imposing Elizabethan manor house surrounded by 17th-century barns, nestling in a beautiful, monumental valley on the Wales-England border near Presteigne. Since his death in 1992 the Rodd has been home to the trust, welcoming artists and groups of young people, and next year it will be opened to the general public for the first time. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Trustee Simon Mundy in the artist’s studio at the Rodd. Photograph: Dimitris Legakis/Athena Pictures That will allow people to see his studio, a fascinating time capsule untouched for 25 years and a place that bears witness to Nolan’s endless experimentation and curiosity, his urge to move on, to try something different. It is a room chaotically piled with tins of Ripolin express gloss, cans of Blair spray paint, bottles of Liquitex gloss polymer and Pelikan ink, little models of army trucks and an out of place steam organ which Nolan is said not to have played. “I’m not entirely sure why it is here,” admitted Plant. “It is clearly something he enjoyed having.” The studio reflects the fast and furious way Nolan worked, determined to catch the moment. “He was such an experimental, innovative artist. Any new material that came out, Sidney was straight on it … he never stood still. He was always interested in the next phase of what he was doing.” Nolan had been drawn to the Rodd, his Eden, by the countryside and the Welsh black cattle which, for him, were reminiscent of the minotaur. At one point he owned four bulls and one cow, “but his poor stockman found it very difficult to keep the four bulls apart.” It was at the Rodd that an elderly Nolan could sometimes be found in the tithe barn, strapped to a bosun’s chair, swinging above a large canvas, making abstract paintings with two spray cans in each hand. Or he might have blacked out the windows in his studio and turned on a powerful light to recreate the harsh sunshine he enjoyed in Australia, not something generally available in the glowering grey of the Welsh Marches.

Photograph: Dimitris Legakis/Athena Pictures Or he might be at the top of the house musing or reading the secondhand books he continually bought from Hay-on-Wye. “Mary [his wife] used to go mad because he would leave them in piles all over the place; half of them he never read.” The sheer variety of Nolan’s work over six decades may be one reason he is not better known. Even Plant admitted that you could think you know him and then see a painting so different you think it couldn’t possibly be by the same artist. “You feel that in his whole career. It is about never standing still, being of the time. He was very difficult to pin down, but you see that in his paintings. You can’t say definitively this is Nolan’s art because something else will be completely different.” Mary Nolan obituary Read more Towards the end of his life Nolan was making abstract work in which he seemed to be reflecting on his life and relationships – relationships that were often complicated and tragic. In the 1940s he was involved in a menage with the arts patrons Sunday and John Reed, a situation which led to the end of his first marriage to Elizabeth. His second marriage was to Cynthia Reed, John’s sister, with whom he settled in London from 1953. The Nobel prize-winning writer Patrick White was a friend, writing in his memoir that Cynthia once told him “that everyone – women, men, dogs – fell in love with Sid.” White was particularly close to Cynthia, a woman he said was steel to Nolan’s elastic. He was shaken by her suicide in 1976 and, in his eyes, Nolan’s too quick marriage to Mary. Simon Mundy, a former neighbour and member of the Nolan Trust board, recalled Nolan as always good company, but rarely garrulous. “He was quite reserved, very quietly spoken but he always had a twinkle … he could be quite owlish. One of the reasons he had such a complicated life was that he would stand back and let the mayhem happen around him.” Since Nolan’s death the Rodd has been a place where visiting artists have a freedom to experiment, while for the groups of young people who come regularly from the West Midlands it is often an opportunity to engage with art for the first time. In the future the trust hopes to make the Rodd an important centre for arts and music and the centenary provides an opportunity to seek the money to do so. At the heart of it will be Nolan, with some of the works the trust owns going on display as the story of his life and output is explored. They hope to acquire more works to better represent the astonishing variety of his output. “His idea always was that he would leave a legacy,” said Plant. “He set this place up as somewhere people would see his work so it is important the trust has a collection. But it is also important when people see the later works to see where they came form.”",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"John Lewis boss: higher minimum wage should boost productivity", "content": "The boss of John Lewis and Waitrose has said the introduction of the “national living wage” could already be boosting productivity in Britain, despite criticism of the policy by senior retail figures. Sir Charlie Mayfield, chairman of the John Lewis Partnership and a government adviser on productivity, told the Guardian that the national living wage could be a “spur to productivity” because it could encourage more use of automation in workplaces. That could lead to fewer jobs in some industries, Mayfield admitted, but would also spur stronger economic growth. “I think we will see automation happening faster. It would be wrong to say that the national living wage is going to create a great increase in automation in sectors like retail, but it will be a contributing factor to an acceleration of automation in some sectors and it will have impact on employment levels,” he said. The national living wage came into force in April and means companies must pay staff aged 25 at least £7.20 an hour. However, retailers warned it could lead to job losses, with Dave Lewis, the boss of Tesco, saying it was part of a “potentially lethal cocktail” of costs facing the industry. Mayfield warned last year that it would lead to a rise in unemployment if productivity did not improve in Britain. Mayfield is now leading an initiative, which received £13m in government funding this year, to try to improve productivity by boosting management skills. He said regulation was a “blunt instrument” for improving productivity but that the national living wage could lead to automation being introduced earlier. The John Lewis chairman added that greater use of technology would ultimately boost the economy. “You can’t really generalise and say this is a recipe for fewer jobs across the country. I think what you can say is that over time if the country is more productive we will create more employment and higher paid employment than the alternative, which is that our competitiveness declines.” Mayfield added that, as well as being a spur to productivity, the policy should be welcomed for attempting to address the UK’s low wage economy. “I think the national living wage will be a spur to productivity. I think that will already be happening,” he said. “I do agree with one of the underlying intents of the national living wage which is to say: ‘We can’t afford as a country to be a low wage economy.’” Mayfield said the threat of job losses from automation would vary from sector to sector. “Different sectors will be affected differently, so the consequence of the Nissan plant in Sunderland being one of the most productive in the world is they are going to be making more cars and more jobs,” he said. “Equally, there will be sectors and companies that are more in a remedial situation. Or indeed where the technology that is available to them has shifted so significantly that they can re-engineer in a much more dramatic way how they carry out current operations. There will be instances where that will lead to fewer jobs.” Mayfield’s productivity council will work on sharing information between businesses and developing tools that allow bosses to measure the health of their company. The John Lewis boss is now looking to make key appointments to the council and roll out an app called “How good is your business really?” which allows businesses to conduct self-assessments. Britain’s productivity problem is dragging down pay and living standards, but Mayfield says it is an issue that is discussed in the “Westminster bubble” rather than businesses themselves. One of the main challenges for his new productivity council will be to transform productivity into a relevant and aspirational target for businesses by linking it to key financial metrics such as sales, profits and cash flow. “As a retailer we measure everything so we have a number of different ways of measuring productivity, but the one we are focusing on much more now is profit per partner,” Mayfield says of the John Lewis Partnership, which is owned by its employees. “What we recognise is that we need to improve our profit per partner to make our business successful in the future. We are actually by most measures a very productive retail business, however the sector is facing some structural and significant challenges, which means even a very good performing business in the retail sector has to improve its productivity in order to thrive and prosper. “Technology is clearly integral to this and the way that we are investing in technology is going to be hugely important.” Philip Hammond, the chancellor, outlined Britain’s productivity problem in stark terms in the autumn statement by saying it took a British worker five days to produce something that their German counterpart could do in four. Mayfield said the management skills he would be encouraging, which were used at John Lewis, were “not rocket science”. “It is having clear objectives, measuring them, doing appraisals, giving feedback – these things. It is surprising how the incidence of businesses exhibiting those practices is relatively low,” he said. “This is a constant focus for us [at John Lewis] and we spend a lot of time actually thinking about how we enhance performance and how we enhance productivity. If you looked at our strategy documents you would find those kinds of things would feature pretty prominently within them, because it is not a question of being in the slightest bit complacent; it’s about constantly looking for improvement.”",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Costa little more: Spain questions its tourism strategy", "content": "For more than half a century, Spain’s tourist fame has rested mainly on its sandy beaches, warm waters and dependable weather. But despite record-breaking visitor numbers over the past 12 months, there are fears the sun could slowly be setting on the country’s traditional approach to attracting foreign holidaymakers. Although Spain is predicted to have welcomed 75 million tourists by the end of this month – up from 68 million last year – the surge is not quite what it seems. The increased numbers are due less to any particular Spanish strategy than to the fact that terrorism and instability have driven millions of holidaymakers from Egypt, Tunisia, Turkey and France. According to the Confederation of Spanish Travel Agencies (CEAV), almost 10% of this year’s tourists are “borrowed” from competing destinations around the Mediterranean. The other problem is that although the overall tourist numbers are up, the average amount they are spending is down, falling 2.2% among European visitors between January and July this year. Add to that fears that some popular destinations are becoming saturated with low-spending tourists whose numbers and behaviour are raising local hackles, and questions are once again being asked about the efficacy of Spain’s decades-old sol y playa (sun and beach) tourism model. A recent report from Ernst & Young noted the declining average spend and recommended that Spain “reorientate its strategy” to attract higher spending “premium” tourists from Europe and beyond rather than continuing to rely on those looking for a cheap break. Philip Moscoso of Spain’s IESE business school discerns “a few shadows lurking among the good news” and says it is time to rethink Spain’s approach to tourism. “In some places, such as the Balearics and Barcelona, we’re starting to see a saturation point where the parts of society begin to feel a little overrun by the tourist hordes. “Although we all know that tourism is our number one industry – and that we owe it considerable thanks economically over the past few years – a lot of people are fed up with so much tourism, especially in summer.” He points to anger at tourists who cram into tiny rented apartments and spend little money on anything but alcohol and going out, or those who head to Ibiza and stay up for three days without booking into hotels. “It’s not all black-and-white, but in places like Barcelona, things will definitely change because in some neighbourhoods, people are taking to the streets to protest,” he said. “When voters do that, [politicians] tend to react.” Moscoso argues that although Spain is working to attract higher spending visitors by sprucing up some of its more dilapidated destinations, it also needs to invest more in promoting its interior and culture. “Obviously, there’s the kilometres of coastline, but there’s also an artistic heritage that needs to be valued and promoted more. Lots of Chinese people visit Paris, Rome and London; they need to know that there are things to visit in Spain, too, and that it’s not just sun and beaches. We need to push that.” Josep Valls, a professor in the marketing department of the Esade business school in Barcelona, said that moves to overhaul the Spanish tourism sector should have begun two decades ago, but were stymied by the influx of holidaymakers abandoning the former Yugoslavia for Spain during the 1990s, and further thwarted by terror attacks on tourist resorts and the uncertainty brought by the Arab spring. However, he said that the concept of innovation is now “working its way into the DNA” of the Spanish tourist industry as it increasingly embraces gastronomy, sport, culture and wine to draw overseas visitors. “People are now realising that the Spanish coast isn’t just useful for two or three months a year: it can be a far less seasonal business,” he said. “It’s about looking beyond beaches as the only places for Europeans on holidays; it’s about using land and heritage in different ways.” Rafael Gallego, president of the CEAV, agrees that more needs to be done to attract tourists with deeper pockets and to promote the country’s wider charms, but insists that the costas will remain the engine of the Spanish tourist economy for a long time. “I don’t think that the sol y playa model is obsolete. It’s obvious that this kind of [holiday] isn’t going to go away,” he said. “Spain’s been growing in borrowed tourism since the Arab spring. But we’ve been missing a great opportunity to take advantage of this by selling everything that Spain has to offer in terms of culture and gastronomy and the countryside of the interior.” Moscoso says that Spain simply cannot afford to take its sunny, sandy allure for granted. With so many guests “borrowed” from other destinations and Brexit raising questions about the future of Spain’s single greatest source of foreign visitors, urgent thought needs to be given to the tourist sector, which accounted for more than 11% of Spain’s GDP in 2015 and which is predicted to grow by 4.4% this year. “It’s a bit like the situation is with people’s health. As long as you don’t notice any symptoms, you don’t go to the doctor. You know that you should stop smoking, take more exercise and eat more healthily – but you only go to the doctor when the problems start. “As long as the numbers look good and the problems aren’t obvious, people won’t react. But when the spend per tourist goes down and the number of tourists also goes down and the sector starts to contract, the big players will start to worry and that’s when the real work will begin.”",diasaster:0},

Chile’s national emergency office (Onemi) lifted both the evacuation order and a tsunami watch three hours after the Christmas Day quake struck and told nearly 5,000 people who had been evacuated they could return to their homes. Onemi said one bridge in the area was impassible as crews worked to restore electricity to 21,000 homes without power. chile earthquake locator Officials had issued a tsunami warning earlier for areas within 620 miles (1,000km) of the epicentre of the quake 140 miles south-west of Puerto Montt, but the warning was downgraded to a tsunami watch. Eight mostly small ports in the area were closed, Chile’s navy said. The quake was felt on the other side of the Andes mountains in Argentina, but structural damage in areas close to the epicentre was limited, witnesses said. “There was a lot, a lot of movement here, but besides that nothing of note, there weren’t houses falling,” said Alamiro Vera, owner of the Cabanas hotel in the southern Chile fishing town of Quellon. “It was just scary, and some things inside fell.” A Reuters witness said some roads and at least one bridge were damaged in Quellon, on Chiloe Island, a tourist destination in Chile’s Los Lagos region. The quake’s depth was about 20 miles, the US Geological Survey (USGS) said. According to media reports, the quake was felt in the south-west Argentinian city of Bariloche. The area hit by Sunday’s quake was south of Valdivia, Chile, where 1,655 people died in a 1960 quake ranked by the USGS as the most powerful recorded in Chile. The region is home to several industrial salmon farms and is a tourism hub. An official with Chile’s national fish and aquaculture service said several companies had evacuated employees and were evaluating their facilities for possible damage.

Hussain Manawer, 25, from Ilford, Essex, is due to blast off in 2018 after seeing off thousands of other entrants from more than 90 countries in a competition. The poet, charity fundraiser and founder of his own creative agency dedicated his victory to everyone who has suffered mental health problems, and said he had an important mission in life. “It’s never really been an ambition of mine [to go into space], but I felt I wasn’t contributing enough to the world,” he said. “I got to the point where I thought we are failing the world so much in so many different ways. When I saw the competition I thought: let me go for it, let me see what happens. “I am using it as a platform to venture into problems, which is how I think it should be. What influenced me is you have to be somebody in order for people to take you seriously, in order to have an impact.” Manawer’s pitch for the Kruger Cowne rising star competition was centred on mental health, from his entry video to his final speech featuring a poem about depression and self-harm, in which he lamented: “I wasn’t meant for this planet.” Facebook Twitter Pinterest Hussain Manawer’s poem at the Kruger Cowne Rising Star competition He plans to release a mixtape featuring his poetry about mental health, and in March he will attempt to set a world record for the largest mental health lesson, for 1,000 students from 30 schools from all over the country, at Hackney Empire in London. Manawer is fully behind a campaign for schoolchildren to be taught about mental health, but believes teachers are under enough pressures and so need outside assistance. Even before winning the space travel competition, Manawer had raised thousands of pounds for charities and given lessons on cyberbullying in 400 schools. He has a successful YouTube channel, Hussain’s House, featuring interviews with the comedian Kevin Hart, rapper G-Eazy and radio presenter Charlamagne, and was a torchbearer in the buildup to the London Olympics. He said he saw the competition to travel beyond the 100km mark in XCOR Aerospace’s Lynx spacecraft as a way of taking his campaigning to another level. The contest was run in association with One Young World, a platform for 18- to 30-year-olds, supported by the likes of Kofi Annan. “Never did I think I’m going to win it,” Manawer said. “I just thought if I can get through a few stages I get to be associated with some good humanitarians and they will take my stuff more seriously. There was Bob Geldof and Fatima Bhutto, who has done humanitarian work in Pakistan. I want to host meetings of global influencers to effect change.” His public profile has soared since winning the competition. He fronted a launch video for London’s night tube, has rubbed shoulders with political leaders and royals and given talks around the world, all squeezed in between his astronaut training.

{ "title":"US travel ban leaves Iranian LGBT refugees in limbo", "content": "Gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender refugees from Iran have found themselves caught between a rock and a hard place after Donald Trump’s executive order banning entry for people from seven Muslim-majority countries. US travel ban puts 20,000 refugees in 'precarious circumstances', UN says Read more The order also suspended the US refugee admissions system for 120 days, and promised to prioritise members of religious minorities. But it made no mention of people facing persecution for their sexual orientation, and several gay Iranians who have fled a country where homosexuality is punishable by death are now left stuck in Turkey, where they say they are experiencing worse homophobic abuses than in their homeland. Some of the refugees have already had their asylum applications approved by the UN refugee agency and were due to be resettled in the US after months or even years of interviews and security checks. Mitra, a 27-year-old lesbian living in Denizli, a conservative city in south-west Turkey, left Iran in 2014 after receiving death threats because of her activities as the editor of Aghaliat, an online magazine focusing on LGBT issues. She was granted refugee status by the UN nearly two years ago, and was due to attend her final interview this month before being resettled in the US. “They have just called me and said it’s all cancelled,” she said. Until Trump’s ban came into force, the US was the only viable path to safety for gay Iranians who end up in Turkey. Canada no longer accepts them because it is focusing on Syrian refugees. European countries do not normally accept LGBT Iranians who have applied from Turkey. Like many of her fellow minorities, Mitra was initially approved to go to Canada. “I waited for 14 months, [and] even went through the medical checks but one day they called and said Canada doesn’t accept Iranians anymore and I should go to the US. Now that’s up in the air too.” Mitra added: “One by one all my dreams and hopes are being destroyed before my eyes. It doesn’t matter to me whether to go to Canada or the US, I just want to go somewhere – anywhere – safe.” Mitra currently lives with her partner in a tiny room with one sofa that is also their bed. “Iran doesn’t want us, Canada doesn’t want us and now the US doesn’t want us either. I have seen the suicide of three friends since 2015. A gay Iranian [threw] himself off a balcony and an Iranian lesbian hanged herself just eight months ago.” She argued that the US should also make exemptions for sexual minorities as well. “At least with religious refugees, they have the support of their families, we don’t even have that. Our families are [ashamed] of us.” Javad, 50, is a disabled Iranian gay man also living in Turkey. “I was abandoned by my family, I was abandoned by my country and now I [do not] have anywhere to go,” he said. He said two of his friends were beaten up in the street. “One day a friend of mine, an Iranian gay name Pouya, called and said, ‘forgive me’,” he said. “I realised he was about to take his life. “I am disabled, I struggled to get to his house, by the time I got there he had died. He had just had enough.” Saghi Ghahraman, the head of the Canada-based Iranian Queer Organisation, said LGBT Iranians face horrific punishment and bullying. A fatwa issued in 1987 by the late Ayatollah Khomeini legalised transexuality, but social stigma remains still rampant, and homosexuality is still punishable by death. “Up until 2013, the wait-time for the LGBT to be determined and resettled by the [UN high commissioner for refugees] in Turkey was about a year and a half, which was barely manageable,” she said. “But it changed with the war in Syria, and when the USA and Canada undertook resettlement of large number of displaced Syrians, the LGBT wait-time before resettlement went up to three years,” she said. Meanwhile, gay Iranian exiles have been subjected to a string of violent hate attacks and murders in Turkey, said Ghahraman. The 26-year-old Azad, a gay Iranian who was approved for relocation by the UN 23 months ago, said his friend fainted in the bus when he heard about Trump’s decision. “We’re stuck, we can’t go forward, we can’t go backward,” he said. “Turkey is so unstable too these days and anything can happen, what if they deport us back to Iran?”",diasaster:0},

Annual growth edged down from 4.5% in December to 4.3%, according to the mortgage lender Nationwide. It was the weakest since November 2015. On a monthly basis, the average price of a UK home edged up 0.2%, to £205,240, following a 0.8% rise in December. Robert Gardner, Nationwide’s chief economist, said there were indications the housing market would soften in 2017, as household budgets come under pressure from higher consumer inflation at a time of weaker jobs and wage growth. UK housing market falters as estate agents become less optimistic Read more “The outlook for the housing market remains clouded, reflecting the uncertainty surrounding economic prospects more broadly,” Gardner said. “On the one hand, there are grounds for optimism. The economy has remained far stronger than expected in the wake of the Brexit vote. However, there are tentative signs that conditions may be about to soften. “The economy is likely to slow through 2017 as the squeeze on household budgets intensifies and heightened uncertainty weighs on business investment and hiring.” Nationwide predicts that growth in house prices will more than halve in 2017 to 2% from 4.5% in 2016. Howard Archer, the chief UK economist at IHS Markit, said conditions for house buyers were likely to deteriorate progressively during 2017. Inflation has already started to rise as the impact of the sharp fall in the value of the pound since the EU referendum feeds through to prices. A weaker pound makes imports from abroad more expensive. The headline rate UK inflation jumped to a two-and-a-half-year high of 1.6% in December from 1.2% in November, and is expected to rise to about 3% in the coming months. Looking back at trends over the last 60 years, Nationwide said the biggest gains in real house prices – comparing how much faster house prices have increased compared with goods and services more generally – were made in the 2000s. “These increases were spurred by a combination of strong and stable economic growth, a structural decline in interest rates and the further liberalisation of the financial system,” Gardner said. “In the decades ahead, real house price trends will continue to depend crucially on developments in the wider economy, though there is an even greater degree of uncertainty around this than usual.”",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Protesters in Romania denounce plan to decriminalise misconduct offences", "content": "Tens of thousands of people have taken to the streets in Romania to protest against an emergency ordinance passed on Tuesday night that decriminalises some offences, including official misconduct in cases where the financial damage is less than 200,000 lei (£38,000). Critics of the ordinance, introduced by a government that won parliamentary elections in December, say it could reverse an anti-corruption fight in Romania that has drawn widespread praise internationally. Additional laws could be issued in the coming days, further eroding ministers’ accountability, according to the government’s opponents. In a post on Facebook, the Romanian president, Klaus Iohannis, who has opposed the emergency ordinance and who last month joined protesters on the streets, wrote: “Today is a day of mourning for the rule of law.” News of the ordinance passing broke at about 10pm local time, and by midnight local media estimated that 12,000 people were demonstrating in Bucharest and 10,000 in other cities across the country, despite freezing temperatures. There were shouts of “Thieves” and “You won’t get away with it.” “I don’t normally protest but I just felt such a sense of rage,” said Alexandra Boeriu, a 35-year-old NGO worker who protested outside the main government building in Bucharest. “I was young, but I did live through communism and I know what this is. I don’t want this for my kids. There are a lot of people protesting who want to have a future in this country. It feels like someone has died.” Facebook Twitter Pinterest Klaus Iohannis: ‘Today is a day of mourning for the rule of law.’ Photograph: Patrick Seeger/EPA “You can’t just publish laws in the night and say shut up, we won the election, you have no rights,” said Dragos Stanca, 42, a digital media entrepreneur who was also demonstrating. “It’s a very dangerous precedent. If this is the kind of procedure they do, we wonder what’s next. It looks like anything is possible.” Protests have been held for the past two Sundays over the government’s plans, which would also grant amnesty to those sentenced to jail terms shorter than five years in relation to certain crimes and halve prison terms for those with young children, pregnant women, or those over 60. The EU has weighed in on the controversy, warning the government not to backtrack on anti-graft measures. “The fight against corruption needs to be advanced, not undone,” European commission head Jean-Claude Juncker and his deputy, Frans Timmermans, said in a joint statement. “We are following the latest developments in Romania with great concern.” Government officials have suggested the laws were aimed at easing overcrowded conditions in prisons, but few observers are convinced, and many believe the real purpose is to help convicted politicians, or those who are now under investigation, escape justice. Romania, an enthusiastic EU member for a decade and a major recipient of EU funds, remains one of Europe’s most corrupt countries: a report by the IPP thinktank released late last year found that of the 588 MPs elected in previous elections in 2012, 89 – or 15% – were either under investigation for graft, had already been convicted, or chose to step down for other positions. Hundreds of officials have been imprisoned in recent years, and more than 2,000 files are under investigation in relation to abuse of office, according to prosecutors. “With this government I feel insecure and the new law which favours corruption is a huge offence and an attack on us, the regular people,” said Alberto Grosescu, a 29-year-old photographer who took to the streets on Tuesday night immediately after the ordinance was announced. Grosescu predicts that many more people will come out to protest. “I’m pretty sure that tonight there is going to be over 100,000 people in Bucharest, maybe over 200,000 across the whole country,” he said. Those protesting hope that their actions could still lead to change. “They have to, I don’t think politicians can ignore so many people, but we have to stand up and continue to stand up,” said Boeriu.

{ "title":"Who is Neil Gorsuch? A staunch conservative with a background to worry liberals", "content": "In a 2005 essay titled Liberals ’N’ Lawsuits, Neil Gorsuch, then a corporate lawyer in Washington, DC, argued that “American liberals” had come to rely too much on court decisions to advance “their social agenda on everything from gay marriage to assisted suicide to the use of vouchers for private-school education”. Published just months after the re-election of George W Bush, it was a remarkable bit of concern-trolling ahead of its time. If liberals really wanted to enact their agenda, Gorsuch wrote, they should focus on “trying to win elections rather than lawsuits”. Neil Gorsuch nominated by Trump to fill supreme court vacancy Read more Fast-forward 12 years. American liberals – and quite a few centrists too – have lost another election and many have once again turned their eyes to the courts, hoping for protection from what looks to many of them like a vicious attack by the executive branch on core rights and freedoms. If Donald Trump has his way Gorsuch will be in a position this time to do more than just write an essay. If confirmed by the Senate as the newest justice on the US supreme court, he will have unique power to help vindicate or frustrate liberals’ strategy. The announcement of Gorsuch’s nomination in a hyped White House spectacle on Tuesday night was greeted with expressions of concern on the left and robust cheer on the right. Carrie Severino, chief counsel of the conservative Judicial Crisis Network, hailed Gorsuch as a “principled constitutionalist” with “an obviously brilliant legal mind”. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Trump picks Neil Gorsuch for US supreme court “He is someone who is going to look at any question according to what the constitution itself says, setting aside his own political views” whatever they may be, Severino said. A partisan scrum has developed around the nomination nevertheless, with Democrats vowing a filibuster and the Republican senate leadership vowing a confirmation. The air of partisan controversy is not obviously rooted in Gorsuch’s track record as a circuit court judge, which does not include rulings on the kinds of hot-button social issues he alluded to in his Bush-era essay. Gorsuch’s disposition on abortion rights cases may be suggested in a line from a book he wrote about euthanasia, the subject of his doctoral studies at Oxford University. “To act intentionally against life is to suggest that its value rests only on its transient instrumental usefulness for other ends,” Gorsuch wrote. Nancy Northup, president and CEO of the Center for Reproductive Rights, said the onus was on the nominee to explain his position on the issue. “Given president Trump’s promise to appoint a supreme court justice that would seek to overturn Roe v Wade, we need to know whether Judge Gorsuch would do just that,” Northup said. The looming issues awaiting Donald Trump's supreme court nominee Read more “Our constitution guarantees a woman’s right to safe, legal abortion. Any effort to gut those protections would harm the rights and health of women for generations to come.” But beyond any single issue Gorsuch has articulated a judicial philosophy that emphasizes the primacy of the constitution and prizes the text of laws, while warning against judicial forays that might be mistaken for an attempt to shape or direct legislation. “Congress could have written the law differently than it did, and it is always free to rewrite the law when it wishes,” Gorsuch wrote in a ruling that argued for a new hearing for a felon convicted of firearm possession. “But in our legal order it is the role of the courts to apply the law as it is written, not some different law Congress might have written in the past or might write in the future.” In some ways Gorsuch seems likely to please social conservatives. He has repeatedly upheld claims of a religious exemption where the law would compel an individual to violate a personal spiritual belief. While the supreme court declined to consider one such “religious liberty” case in 2016, in which a family-owned pharmacy objected to a state regulation forcing it to sell emergency contraceptives, future cases in the area seem likely. In Hobby Lobby Stores Inc v Sebelius, Gorsuch argued that a retail store owner need not comply with a provision in Barack Obama’s health care law requiring employers to provide health insurance covering oral contraceptives. In his opinion Gorsuch gave wide berth to the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which asserts the religious liberty claim and which Gorsuch called a “super-statute”. Hannah Smith, a lawyer at the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, which represented Hobby Lobby in the case, praised the judge’s ruling. “That opinion is an example that he is a clear thinker, a clear writer on really complicated religious liberty issues,” Smith told the Guardian. “They were faced with a Hobson’s choice, to choose to abide by their religion or saving their business. I think he’s someone who would stand up for the religious liberty for all.” Elsewhere Gorsuch has ruled sympathetically in cases involving the erection of Ten Commandments monuments in public spaces and ruled against capital punishment defendants seeking relief from their sentences. In the integrity of his adherence to the principal of judicial restraint, as well as in the pithy eloquence – if he lacks a certain acerbity – of his opinions, Gorsuch is often compared favorably with the justice he would replace, Antonin Scalia, who died in February 2016. “His writing style has often been compared to Justice Scalia’s,” Severino said. “It’s very incisive, very clear and logical, but also very entertaining, and of course that was a hallmark of Justice Scalia’s own writing style.” Gorsuch spoke about Scalia’s death in an April 2016 speech at Case Western University. “I was taking a breather in the middle of a ski run with little on my mind but the next mogul field when my phone rang with the news,” Gorsuch said. “I immediately lost what breath I had left, and I am not embarrassed to admit that I couldn’t see the rest of the way down the mountain for the tears. He really was a lion of the law: docile in private life but a ferocious fighter when at work, with a roar that could echo for miles.” Gorsuch’s biggest difference with Scalia comes in the field of administrative law, an area that is sleepy for most laypeople but determines the scope of much government action. The Trump nominee has been a critic of “Chevron deference,” a doctrine that gives administrative agencies significant latitude with how they interpret federal statutes. His views, which are shared by a number of conservative legal scholars, would significantly weaken the federal government and allow the courts to override agency actions on issues ranging from immigration to health care to the environment. But several former colleagues of Gorsuch’s from across the ideological spectrum have called for Gorsuch’s confirmation, saying his temperament is distinctly different from Scalia. “Scalia’s writing seemed dismissive to the claims of gay rights,” said Melissa Hart, professor at the University of Colorado Law School who worked with Gorsuch. “Everything I know about Neil Gorsuch as a person leads me to believe he would not be dismissive of anyone’s claims, regardless of how he rules. I’m not saying I think he will rule in favor of LGBT rights but I don’t think he will be dismissive of anyone’s claims.” Hart said she believes Gorsuch is “more than qualified to be on the supreme court”, echoing an op-ed in the New York Times by Neal Katyal, a former acting solicitor general under Barack Obama, that called for liberals to back Gorsuch. “I understand the political reasons for wanting to block the nomination,” Hart said, “but I don’t think there’s a principled reason to reject Neil Gorsuch as a jurist.” Neil McGill Gorsuch was born on 29 August 1967 and grew up in Denver, Colorado. His family moved to Washington, DC, after Ronald Reagan nominated his mother, Anne Gorsuch Burford, to head the Environmental Protection Agency. Gorsuch attended Georgetown preparatory school, Columbia University, Harvard Law school and Oxford University, where he enrolled on a Marshall scholarship and earned a doctorate. He fits the mold of every sitting justice on the US supreme court in educational pedigree: they all went to Harvard or Yale for law school. Post-graduation, Gorsuch worked for a decade representing mostly corporate clients at the Washington law firm of Kellogg Huber Hansen Todd Evans & Figel. But Mark Hansen, the nominee’s former boss at the firm, told the Denver Post that Gorsuch was a “regular person”. “He acts and relates well to all people, and he did the same sort of thing in trial, where he was very good at making connections with jurors,” Hansen said. “He’s a regular person. It’s part of being a Westerner.” At Oxford, Gorsuch met his future wife, Louise Gorsuch, a UK citizen. With their two teenage daughters they lives outside Boulder, Colorado, where Gorsuch indulges hobbies including fly-fishing, hiking and rowing. After his 2005 essay subtly celebrating the re-election of George W Bush, Gorsuch got good news from the administration. Gorsuch was to be appointed to the 10th circuit appeals court, which covers all or part of Colorado, Kansas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Utah and Wyoming. In 2006, when it came time for the Senate to review his nomination, Gorsuch was confirmed in the most expeditious way possible, by a voice vote and encountering no objection.

{ "title":"The Guardian view on Brexit: more haste, less speed", "content": "In the end, 47 Labour MPs decided to vote against the bill triggering article 50. Two more frontbenchers, Dawn Butler and Rachel Maskell, resigned in order to vote against Jeremy Corbyn’s ill-advised three-line whip. Many MPs, in two days of often deeply felt debate, said they felt bound to honour their voters’ wishes despite their belief that leaving the EU will be a disaster for the economy, and regardless of the majority for remain among people who would normally vote Labour. The difficulty of this vote for the party was etched on the face of the shadow Brexit secretary, Sir Keir Starmer, as he wove his way through the mess of conflicting ambitions that constitute current party policy. We would rather that the party had voted with its heart than, as it perhaps did, with an eye on its electoral prospects in leave areas like Stoke and Copeland. We would say the same about the Conservative remainers too. But Labour’s equivocations on Europe long predated the vote and will continue long after. Yet unless it can find a stronger position to unite around on such a central issue, Labour will struggle to be a credible party of opposition. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Brexit debate: the best Commons speeches, from Ken Clarke to Nick Clegg But Labour’s dismal performance is not the real scandal of Wednesday’s vote, and those who pretend it is are playing the leavers’ game. The real scandal is that, with the distinguished exception of Ken Clarke, the Tory party’s many remainers bent the knee. As a result, the government had an overwhelming majority on the second reading of the bill to trigger article 50. Its failure to publish a white paper before the debate went unpunished. This disregard for the most basic of requirements for a decision of such consequence must not be allowed to be a taste of things to come. It is all the more alarming that, as late as Tuesday, it seems no draft had been circulated: the home secretary, a member of the small group of senior ministers who sit on the cabinet committee on Brexit, told MPs she had not seen it. Yet, even as the potentially grim consequences of Brexit become clearer, Theresa May’s timetable for the process of departure remains on track. It is not all over, however. Everything is still possible. Now the prime minister must come clean about the choices that lie ahead, and their consequences – and she must convey to the whole of Britain the scale of the task ahead. Even without a white paper, it is clear that she puts controlling borders and repatriating law at the head of her list of priorities. It is also clear, as George Osborne told the Commons, that at the head of the EU’s list is the integrity of the union of the remaining 27 members. Those governing ideas will, unavoidably, make many of the other ambitions that Mrs May set out in her speech a fortnight ago extremely challenging. The negotiations will be just that – negotiations that must be conducted with the intention of reaching an agreement that is acceptable for both sides. It is an irony that Mrs May will not appreciate that the European court of justice from which she so ardently wishes to escape is highly likely to be called in to adjudicate on aspects of the final deal, as its president Koen Lenaerts points out. Mrs May talks ominously about no deal being better than a bad deal, and claims to be prepared to crash out on World Trade Organisation terms. This is a terrible strategy. As the SNP’s Westminster leader, Angus Robertson, put it at prime minister’s questions, Mrs May has made one successful foreign trip in the past week. That was her trip to Dublin, where she and the Irish taoiseach, Enda Kenny, discussed how best to preserve the free trade area and protect the Northern Ireland peace process. She would do well to take the lesson about the value of negotiations conducted in good faith and a spirit of cooperation. A hard Brexit would be ruinous. Every MP should spend the coming week consulting their local businesses on the impact of WTO terms, and calculate their likely impact on jobs and prices. The referendum itself has been a catastrophe. But if Mrs May continues to treat leaving the EU as if it can be achieved in a couple of years of hard work, she is doing the voters a grave disservice. She knows the cost of making pledges on immigration that are unachievable. Suggesting that Brexit can be done and dusted before the next election is a deceit on a monstrous scale. As Sir Ivan Rogers, the former UK ambassador to the EU, told MPs on the Brexit committee on Wednesday morning, the task ahead was “humongous”. It would, unavoidably, be bloody. This will be a long game, and the government must say so.",diasaster:0},

Severe weather warnings remained in place for Christmas Eve, with a Met Office warning of wind, snow and ice for northern parts of the country. Winds of 60-70mph were expected across the west and north-west of Scotland, with gusts up to 120mph recorded on the summit of Cairn Gorm on Friday. Properties in Aberdeenshire, Moray and on the Western Isles lost power. Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks confirmed its engineers had restored power to 14,855 homes, while they were working to help a further 445 customers in the north of Scotland. Storm Barbara: fears over Christmas travel as Met Office issues warnings Read more The worst of the storm conditions were forecast to be in the far north of the country and the Western and Northern Isles, but disruption to power supplies and travel was expected to be felt across the UK. The Met Office issued yellow warnings of snow and ice for parts of Scotland and flood alerts are in place for the Highlands and Western Isles, as well as Skye and the Scottish Borders. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Strong winds have disturbed travel in some parts of the UK. Photograph: Andy Buchanan/AFP/Getty Images The AA warned motorists to be “very savvy” when driving in a “nasty cocktail of potential road disruption”, and Cumbria police warned of high winds and rain, urging people to drive slowly and only if necessary. More travel misery in the north is expected on Boxing Day, with a further amber alert for Storm Conor now being issued for the far north of the country. Amber “be prepared” wind warnings are in place for northern and western parts of Scotland for Friday afternoon, evening and overnight into Christmas Eve. The Met Office warned about potential structural damage – more likely across the north-west of the warning area – as well as disruption to power supplies and travel, with restrictions on bridges and disruption to ferries. Brent Walker, the Met Office’s deputy chief meteorologist, said: “Storm Barbara is crossing the Atlantic and will pass close to the north-west of the UK during Friday, bringing the potential for some disruption to power supplies and travel, and possibly structural damage.” The Local Government Association, which represents hundreds of councils in England and Wales, said it was issuing renewed advice on how to deal with flash floods and had stockpiled more than 1m tonnes of salt to grit roads. Rail disruption is expected to cause more trouble for holidaymakers, with a number of lines closed for an extended period as Network Rail carries out up to 200 improvement projects costing £103m. The company defended the scheduling. Network Rail’s chief executive, Mark Carne, told BBC Breakfast: “The reality is, this is the best time of the year for us to do this sort of huge engineering project because the numbers of people travelling by train is about half of what it is on a normal weekend or a normal day.” No trains will operate to or from London Paddington between Christmas Eve and Thursday because of work to build Crossrail. As a result, Heathrow Express services will be suspended for six days and Great Western Railway trains will terminate at Ealing Broadway.

The Rail, Maritime and Transport union has confirmed the three-day action will go ahead. Engineering work will also affect passengers travelling in Manchester and Cardiff. The annual festive shutdown means no trains will run on Christmas Day and only limited services on Boxing Day. That could push more travellers into cars; the AA predicted up to 12m cars would be on the roads on Friday. The AA’s John Snowling said: “It’s likely to be very busy at peak times on the major routes as the Christmas getaway coincides with commuter traffic. With Christmas falling on a weekend, many people will start their break from Friday, but almost a third of our members will be making their journey on Saturday and more than a fifth will be travelling on Christmas Day to visit friends and family.” Highways England said 448 miles of roadworks on motorways and major roads had been suspended or completed, leaving 98% of roads free of works until 3 January. The roadside rescue firm Green Flag estimated that almost 500,000 people would break down between 15 December and 15 January – equivalent to one every 11 minutes. The coach operator National Express reported last month that its bookings for Christmas Day were up by more than a third compared with last year, and demand for seats on Boxing Day had risen by almost a fifth. It is running its biggest Christmas service, with 50% more coaches on 25 December than last year. The travel association Abta said Friday was expected to be the busiest day for airports as people left to spend Christmas overseas. More than 4.5 million people will be heading abroad from the UK between 18 December and 2 January.

{ "title":"Champagne tastes better with bigger bubbles, study finds", "content": "Bigger bubbles could make your champagne taste better this Christmas, research has found. It was long thought that a steady stream of tiny bubbles in a glass of champagne was a sign of quality. But researchers in France’s Champagne-Ardenne region have found that larger bubbles may actually improve the way a sparkling wine tastes. Bigger bubbles – about 3.4mm across at the surface – dramatically enhance the release of aerosols into the air above the glass, the experts found. It means important aromatic compounds that give champagne its distinctive smell and flavour are flung into drinkers’ noses when they take a sip. Look closer at nativity paintings – and see visions of apocalypse Read more Prof Gérard Liger-Belair, a physicist at the University of Reims, who led the research, said: “This result is remarkable as it undermines the popular belief that the smaller the bubbles, the better the champagne. Small bubbles were the worst in terms of aroma release.” About 1m bubbles form in the average glass of champagne, according to Liger-Belair. They are a result of dissolved carbon dioxide, which forms in the wine due to a second fermentation process that occurs during production inside the sealed bottles. Using high-speed photography and imaging techniques, Liger-Belair and his colleagues have been able to study precisely what happens to a champagne bubble. In a study published in the European Physical Journal Special Topics, they show that the bubbles form a regular hexagonal pattern on the surface. When one collapses, it creates a cavity that stretches the neighbouring bubbles, producing a pattern that looks similar to the petals of a flower, creating an avalanche of tiny droplets that are thrown into the air at the top of the glass. Wine experts often use bubble size as a marker of quality, with larger bubbles found in cheap sparkling wines such as prosecco and cava. Liger-Belair said bubble size in champagne and sparkling could vary from between 0.4mm and 4mm across. The viscosity of the drink and the glass it is poured into could all influence how big the bubbles were. But bubbles with a radius of 1.7mm across resulted in the highest number of droplets evaporating at the surface of the drink. He said the research could help lead to innovations that could improve the taste of sparkling wines. “We showed that decreasing champagne viscosity would improve drop evaporation,” said Liger-Belair. “Additives that would change wine viscosity without changing the taste might be used. These results pave the way towards fine tuning of champagne aroma diffusion.” It is the latest in a long line of research by Liger-Belair and his colleagues. They have shown that chilling champagne can help to reduce the amount of alcohol carried in each bubble, which can prevent more delicate flavours from being overpowered. Cooling a bottle of champagne to 4C (39F) can help reduce the speed of the cork as it leaves the bottle, preventing accidents, the team found. Tilting the glass when pouring can also help prevent it from overflowing. Drinking from a flute rather than a wider glass can help to enhance the flavour because of how bubbles mix in a glass. Liger-Belair said: “Bubbles in a glass of champagne may seem like the acme of frivolity to most people, but in fact they may be considered a fantastic playground for any fluid physicist.”",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Oscar's £52m move to Shanghai is worrying for Chelsea FC – and China", "content": "Fine wines. Fast cars. Old masters. To the list of luxury goods that have been snapped up by China’s new rich, add Premier League footballers after Shanghai SIPG struck a deal to buy Oscar, Chelsea’s Brazilian midfielder. A transfer fee of some £52m meant the west London club made a tidy profit on a player they bought for £19m four-and-a-half years ago, but has set alarm bells ringing in the Premier League. The concern for Chelsea’s manager Antonio Conte and Arsenal’s Arsene Wenger is that there will now be an exodus of Premier League talent to Chinese clubs. Observers of China’s economy are worried about the transfer deal for a different reason. Buying up “trophy” assets is the hallmark of a bubble economy and when the prices paid start to look silly it is a sign that the bubble is about to burst. Some might say that paying more than £50m for a player who can’t get a game in Chelsea’s first team and offering him £400,000 a week in wages falls into the silly category. Dhaval Joshi, senior vice-president at BCA Research, said: “One defining feature of the last 40 years is a steady sequence of private sector credit booms which have inevitably turned to busts: notably, Japan in 1990, the Asian “tigers” in 1998, the US in 2007, and the UK, Spain and other European countries in 2008. “In this defining feature, China’s is the last of the major credit booms that hasn’t turned to bust – yet.” The pricking of an asset-price bubble is always the last chapter of a story that starts promisingly. By the time Japan’s property boom peaked, the value of the grounds of the imperial palace in Tokyo was allegedly greater than that of the whole of California. Yet the bubble was the culmination of a prolonged period of strong growth that saw Japan’s economy rebuilt after the devastation caused by the second world war. Similarly, there was an explanation for the bidding up of technology stocks during the Dotcom bubble of the 1990s. There were real digital breakthroughs happening, but easy credit meant the boom got out of hand. China’s economic transformation since the reforms introduced by Deng Xiaoping in the late 1970s has been remarkable. According to the World Bank, growth has averaged 10% a year and more than 800 million people have been lifted out of poverty. Fortunes have been earned, with Deloitte noting that there are now more billionaires in Beijing (100) than in New York City (95). After three decades of rapid expansion, China’s economy was showing signs of overheating when the financial crisis began in 2007. But its export-dominated economy was vulnerable to the collapse in trade and industrial production that followed the demise of the US investment bank Lehman Brothers. The government in Beijing, fearful that economic hardship would lead to political unrest, eased policy aggressively. Banks were flooded with cash and there was an extensive programme of public works. Not all the money was well spent. Roads were built that were not needed, ghost towns were constructed, factories that were unprofitable were kept open. And with fewer good bets to back in the real economy, investors awash with cash discovered the joys of asset speculation. They have developed a penchant for western brands. In the UK Chinese investors have snapped up prestige names including Sunseeker motor yachts, Hamleys and House of Fraser store groups and the Odeon cinema chain. In recent days they have agreed to hand over £97m for the loss-making Aquascutum label and earlier this month a Chinese government-backed investment group, Sinofortone, bought the Plough at Cadsden – the Buckinghamshire pub where David Cameron once shared a pint with China’s president, Xi Jinping. Four Midlands football clubs are already owned by Chinese investors – West Brom, Wolves, Birmingham City and Aston Villa – while Sinofortone has been linked with a possible bid for Liverpool FC. By 2013, the limits of China’s “expansion at any cost” approach had been reached. Beijing started to restrict credit growth and the focus shifted towards the need for slower but better-balanced growth. But since then, policy has zigzagged as policy makers have tried to get the balance right. Laura Eaton, an economist at the consultancy Fathom, said that earlier this year the authorities “threw in the towel” when the economy slowed by more than expected and reverted to stimulus. But the policy shift was relatively short-lived because Beijing is worried by the risks associated with another boom. Bank lending growth has peaked, the property market has slowed, and fiscal policy has become less supportive. Andrew Kenningham of Capital Economics says this should result in economic growth slowing from around 6% in late 2016 to an average of nearer 5% in 2017 but he doesn’t expect a “hard landing”. Joshi’s analysis suggests that Premier League managers should not worry too much about a mass exodus of their star players, pointing out that Beijing’s balancing act cannot go on for ever. “Admittedly, the ability of the Chinese authorities to ‘extend and pretend’ is probably greater than elsewhere in the world, and this might prevent another violent tipping point. “Irrespective, the debt super cycle is over when the cost of malinvestment and misallocation of capital outweighs the benefit of good credit creation. With private sector indebtedness (including state owned enterprises) now at, or beyond, the level where every other credit boom peaked, China appears to be approaching this point.”",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Joan Court obituary", "content": "My friend Joan Court, the animal and human rights activist, who has died aged 97, was driven by a powerful impulse to expose and remedy injustice and cruelty. She was also, as she put it, a “born sensualist”, her tastes running to strong colours, perfumes and “exciting action”. This, and her desire to do good, underpinned her many adventures. Her start in life was hard: her father, Cecil Court, a solicitor, took his own life, and her mother, Muriel (nee Gibson), was an alcoholic. She had an older brother, Peter. Joan’s schooling ended when she was 12, after her father’s death. She and her mother moved from their London home to work in domestic service in Cornwall and then Cape Town, South Africa. Returning to London in 1936, she went on to qualify as a nurse and midwife at St Thomas’ hospital, and as a social worker in Bristol. She practised as a midwife and, funded initially by the Friends Service Council (FSC) and later as a World Health Organisation employee, worked in impoverished regions of India and Turkey, and the Appalachian mountains of North America. In the 1960s, she was appointed director of the NSPCC battered child research unit, and was influential in gaining acceptance of a then unfamiliar concept in the UK. In 1946, when she was working for the FSC, organising midwifery services in the slums of Calcutta (Kolkata), she met and got to know Mahatma Gandhi. Joan, a lifelong vegetarian, developed a profound respect for his commitment, compassion and determination to achieve change through non-violent means. She tried to emulate these goals, campaigning first for children and, for the last 38 years, for animals. In 1978, after seeing a poster describing the horrors of animal research, she took part in an Animal Aid anti-vivisection march in Cambridge. The next day she founded a new Cambridge group, which was soon involved in all animal-related issues, including live exports, hunting, shooting, whaling and the meat and dairy industries. Her advanced age made her attention-grabbing stunts also irresistible to the media. Her animal campaigning began just before she was 60 – when she gained a social anthropology degree from Cambridge. There were banner-hangs, public hunger strikes and sit-downs in inconvenient places. She locked herself in a cage and chained herself to railings. In speeches and interviews she refused to apologise for radical direct action, although she was opposed to violence. Her most lasting triumph was, with Pat Griffin and Sue Hughes, as one of three Cambridge “granarchists” who initiated what became a national campaign of opposition to Cambridge University’s plans for a massive new research facility that would have specialised in invasive neurological experiments on monkeys. The university abandoned the project in January 2004. At the age of 85, she joined the Sea Shepherd flagship, Farley Mowat, on a hunt for illegal fishing vessels in the South Atlantic.

{ "title":"EU member states must work together to tackle migration flows", "content": "Andy Burnham’s contribution (Let’s take back control of the immigration debate, 17 December) is sane and helpful but incomplete. The EU principle of freedom of movement is not incompatible with Britain’s interest in managing immigration. The issue is not mobility itself, but whether mobility involves entitlement to full citizenship rights – social security, residence, healthcare, employment, etc. Citizenship is a political, economic and social status, as the sociologist TH Marshall argued long ago, involving more than possessing a document, or even paying taxes. Citizenship involves a range of obligations, and rights. This broader conception of citizenship is widely shared throughout Europe, and provides a starting point for a more realistic discussion of migration than simple numbers. Several EU member states share an interest in managing migration. In addition to the concern in other west European countries, it is not in Poland’s interest for Polish graduates to be washing cars in Britain, or in Romania’s interest for its graduates to be working in Italy, Spain or the UK. EU discussions of freedom of movement in 2003-04 were based on little serious research. It was expected that migration flows within Europe would even out over time, with much short-term migration and long-term migration in the low thousands. The Blair government was so confident that migration would not pose any problem for Britain that it rejected the transition period adopted elsewhere (except for Ireland and Sweden). It was also expected that per capita GDP growth in eastern Europe would reduce the incentive for migration. However, despite structural adjustment funds from the EU and western capital investment, GDP per capita remains lower in several east European countries than in western Europe, supporting migration push. Migration flows are a matter of concern for all EU member states, and capable of negotiation, within the framework of freedom of movement. Brexit will be deeply damaging to the UK, economically, politically and even culturally, and to Europe. It is a tragic example of solving a manageable problem at the expense of creating a much bigger one.

{ "title":"Pat Metcalfe obituary", "content": "A lifelong activist in the Labour party, my wife, Pat Metcalfe, who has died of cancer aged 71, served as a Labour councillor on Lincolnshire county council from 1983 until 2001, and was the council’s chair of education from 1993 to 1997. She was a powerful advocate for early years provision and led the way in the building of several new nursery schools, and the improvement of council services for those with special educational needs. She also played a significant role with her Labour colleagues in establishing the University of Lincoln in the city. Pat was a great champion of comprehensive education and the sternest of critics of the commodification of education and the advent of market principles in the schools system. She was also passionate about the need to address inequality and injustice and a real champion of equality for women. On the left of the Labour party, she retained her loyalty to the party through the difficult years of pragmatic compromise. Pat was born in Dublin, daughter of Michael and Ita Murphy. They separated while she was still a baby, and Ita started a new life with her four daughters, Kathleen, Vicky, Theresa and Pat, in York, where she got a job as production supervisor at the Rowntree’s chocolate factory. Pat was educated at the Bar Convent school, York, then went to Harrogate Art College. She retained her artistic and creative talents later in life, and often made clothes for herself and our children in the early years of our marriage. Pat and I met through the 60s peace movement, as rebellious teenagers with dreams of changing the world. She was the chair of York youth CND and I was the organiser of the North East Committee of 100 (the civil disobedience wing of the peace movement), based in an office in York. We were involved in the organisation of many of the civil disobedience demonstrations at that time, and so we did a lot of campaigning together, as well as an awful lot of dancing in the jazz clubs in York. We married in 1963, when Pat was 18, and she devoted much of her early adult life to bringing up our children, Rachelle and Paul. We lived first in Birmingham, and then London, where I trained as a social worker and Pat’s voluntary work included a spell in the youth service in the East End. When we moved to Lincolnshire with dreams of “the good life” and self-sufficiency after a decade in the city, we quickly got involved in local politics. Pat was also a volunteer at and then, in the 1980s, a director of the Lincoln branch of Samaritans. Warm, generous, loving and brave, she gave me unending support and took great joy in later years in the arrival of our grandsons, Daniel and Sean. Pat is survived by me, our children and grandchildren, and her sisters, Kathleen and Vicky.",diasaster:0},

{ "title":"Study of UK comedy panel shows finds just one all-female episode", "content": "The most comprehensive analysis ever carried out of comedy panel shows has found that only once in the history of British TV and radio has a programme had an all-female lineup. Of more than 4,700 individual episodes examined by data scientist Stuart Lowe, 1,488 programmes since 1967 have been made up solely of men. But only on one occasion in 49 years has there been a programme in which the presenter and all the panel were women – an episode of BBC Radio 4’s Heresy in January 2012 presented by Victoria Coren Mitchell. Lowe, who trained as an astronomer, works at the Open Data Institute in Leeds. He compiled his research in his spare time over more than four years, after his irritated observations about the scarcity of women on comedy panel shows developed, he cheerfully admits, into an obsession. He compiled his mind-bogglingly detailed research – which lists all the participants of every episode of every programme he could find over five decades – by trawling through the BBC iPlayer archives and those of other broadcasters, adding figures shared by other individuals who had done their own research into specific shows, and by trawling through back issues of the Radio Times dating from 1967, when Just a Minute first broadcast on BBC Radio 4. While women still account for just 31% of appearances on comedy panel shows, the analysis shows there has been a steady and sustained improvement since 1989, when that figure was a shocking 3%. Statistically, however, the best year for equality remains 1967, thanks to the fact that for its first series, Just a Minute never fielded fewer than two women out of a total of five participants, including the presenter Nicholas Parsons. The trend towards equality long predates the BBC’s announcement in 2014 that panel programmes without women were “not acceptable”. The broadcaster has been as good as its word, Lowe found. Since then, no nationally broadcast BBC comedy panel show has been screened without a female participant, though in some cases, such as Mock the Week, that number has been stubbornly stuck at one and no more for regular episodes. “It’s a little bit of an obsession,” Lowe said, “and I’ve made a rod for my own back in that I have to keep it updated, which slightly drives me insane when I realise some weeks I’ve missed some panel shows and I have to go back and add them.” So what keeps him going – a crusading feminism or a data obsession? “I don’t think they have to be at opposite ends of the spectrum. You can care about equality and about data at the same time. I think it’s a problem that half the population isn’t fully represented.” Lowe has built his database to accommodate the potential scenario in which a performer does not identify as male or female, but as another gender. Until last week, he had used an “other” category only once – for the tub of lard that appeared in place of Roy Hattersley on Have I Got News For You in 1993. The late withdrawal of Nicky Morgan from the programme last Friday, when she was replaced by an expensive handbag, brought that total to two. Lowe also analysed the ages of participants by trawling through Wikipedia, and said he would like to measure educational background and ethnicity, “but that would be harder to do because I would have to categorise people based on appearance, and I would be reluctant to do that”. The programme with the highest female participation, at over 60%, is Listomania on BBC Radio 2, though Lowe’s personal scoring index gives highest marks for a consistently equal spread of women and men to BBC2’s Insert Name Here, hosted by Sue Perkins. Coren Mitchell told the Guardian she had initially hoped her all-female episode of Heresy – in which her guests were Maureen Lipman, Perkins and Cerys Matthews – would pass unremarked “as though it were completely normal. Of course that was screwed up by the continuity announcer on the night who went: ‘And here’s something unusual – an all-female lineup!’ So that scuppered that. “The thing that surprised me is that it turned out to be the silliest episode of the series,” Coren said – neither less funny, as sexists might expect, or with some deeper feminist meaning. “It was just daft, very funny and very trivial.” She added: “My theory is that, because productions usually put one woman on a panel show (or none) and stop there, women get used to having to (at some wearisome level) ‘represent’ female humour when we appear on these shows ... but with four women the pressure was off. It was nobody’s individual responsibility to prove anything. So we all got the chance to just mess about, relax and make free jokes like men do.” Of 11 episodes that have had 75% or more female involvement since 1967, Lowe found, Coren Mitchell appeared in four. Deborah Frances-White, a standup comedian whose own panel show, Global Pillage, is among a number of podcasts analysed by Lowe, agrees about the pressure female comedians experience when they find themselves the only woman on a panel. “A lot of the time what people don’t realise they are watching is five men in their local pub – they are regulars, they look like everyone else and they are made to feel welcome – and one woman on a job interview. Because she knows that not only will [the audience] decide whether she is good enough to be allowed back on this show and other panel shows, but they will be judging whether all women are funny.” Though it doesn’t solve the problem, increasing the number of women as hosts or regulars makes a significant difference, notes Lowe – he credits QI (BBC), 8 Out of 10 Cats (Channel 4) and E4’s Virtually Famous for all having recently appointed female team captains or presenters. Facebook Twitter Pinterest The BBC’s QI recently appointed Sandi Toksvig as its presenter, replacing Stephen Fry. Photograph: Brian Ritchie/BBC/Talkback/Brian Ritchie ITV’s Celebrity Juice and Play to the Whistle both have female hosts or team captains, and Saskia Schuster, the commissioning editor of comedy entertainment at ITV, said the broadcaster was always “conscious of the mix of voices we are bringing to the show, whether that’s gender, race, class, age”. However, she acknowledged that TV had “some way to go” to reflect the increasing numbers of women entering the traditionally male-dominated comedy scene. “As an industry, we definitely need to achieve a better balance of gender on our shows and this is what we are pushing for from our producers and guest bookers, so that the discussion moves on from gender representation and eventually ceases to be a discussion at all,” she said. A Channel 4 insider said it was committed to more women working both on- and offscreen on its major panel shows, saying the production teams on some of its highest-profile programmes “skewed heavily female”. A BBC spokeswoman said the broadcaster was “keen to make sure our programmes reflect our audiences”, which was why it had led the way on committing in 2014 to having women onscreen on every show. “We are proud of the roster of funny women we have across television and radio. Whilst these figures show there is still more for all broadcasters to do, it is encouraging to see a trend towards better representation of women in recent years,” she said. Searingly honest, bitingly funny: the female millennials changing comedy Read more While some see more women making a career in standup, Lowe acknowledges there are still fewer women on the comedy circuit. His best estimate last year, based on an analysis of Chortle’s database of working comedians, was that about 18% of standups are women. “People are right to say that the comedy circuit is a problem – and that isn’t the broadcasters’ fault,” said Lowe. But even taking that percentage into account, he said, one would statistically expect those programmes that appear stuck on a maximum of one female guest to have a number of episodes where there were two or three women, “and that just isn’t happening”. For any bookers still struggling to find funny women, Lowe has compiled a list of 168 of them – he welcomes further submissions. Some have argued that the heyday of traditional panel shows is fading, while female comics are thriving in other formats on TV and radio, from Phoebe Waller-Bridge’s Fleabag to Catastrophe, co-starring and co-written by Sharon Horgan. A spokeswoman for Radio 4 said it was proud to include “lots of talented female comedians” on panels, but added: “Panel shows are only part of our offering, and next year we have brand new shows from the likes of Sara Pascoe, Sarah Kendall and double act Lazy Susan.” Facebook Twitter Pinterest Danielle Ward: ‘I’m just not interested in hearing four straight, white comedians talking about themselves.’ Photograph: Claes Gellerbrink Danielle Ward created BBC Radio 4 Extra’s Dilemma and Do the Right Thing, which she presents on Comedy.co.uk; the latter recently filmed a pilot for Channel 4, with Claudia Winkleman hosting. “If I achieve nothing else in my career, my panel show pilot had five women on it,” she tweeted after filming. “Fuck yeah.” With both shows, Ward said, she and her producer have very deliberately booked diverse panels, and she never has more than two straight white men: “It’s not about being a corrective. I’m just not interested in hearing four straight, white comedians talking about themselves. The conversation is never going to be as interesting.” For the same reason, Ward said she would not book four straight women. “It’s not about correcting it in terms of numbers, it’s about offering a sense of conversation that’s beyond just one narrow pool of people.”",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Certain family court hearings to take place in public in radical trial", "content": "Family court hearings are to be held in public for the first time, in a radical trial being pursued by the leading family judge for England and Wales, the Guardian understands. Sir James Munby, the president of the family division of the high court, is to continue far-reaching reforms to bring more transparency to the system in 2017 by launching a trial in which some types of hearings would be held in public. It is expected appropriate orders will remain in place to protect the identities of the participants. A separate plan is being considered to allow the media access to documents from hearings that have previously been kept secret. Shocking domestic abuse statistics don’t show the real picture: it’s even worse | Kate Moss Read more Women who have suffered domestic violence and experienced the family courts broke the ban on discussing their cases to reveal to the Guardian how they believe the secrecy of the system allows them to be further abused by ex-partners. Claire Waxman, of Voice4Victims, who campaigns to highlight abuse of process within the family and civil courts, welcomed moves to increase the openness of the court system. “We would support the increase of transparency in the family courts,” she said. “We are seeing far too many victims of stalking and domestic violence being exposed to unnecessary risk and harm in these court proceedings.” But Munby’s changes are likely to be opposed by much of the legal profession working within the family division. Joanne Edwards, former chair of Resolution, the national family law association, and head of family law at Forsters, said: “There is pretty widespread, if not universal, opposition to the public hearing pilot which is being suggested and to the release of court documents to members of the press. “There is strong opposition to any further opening up of the court amongst the professions. For us it is about safeguarding the interests of children who, unlike in criminal proceedings, invariably become embroiled in family proceedings through no fault of their own. There is a real risk of jigsaw identification and once details of their private family life are out there, they can never be retrieved. The resulting harm to children can be profound.” Family courts, which deal with issues such as divorce, financial provision for children, contact with children, adoption and local authority intervention to protect children, were opened to the media in 2009, but hearings largely remain secret. Judges can limit media attendance, there are tight restrictions on what – if anything – can be reported, the media have no access to documents and can be ordered to leave the court on the decision of the judge or magistrate. Munby consulted closely with senior lawyers in Australia, where family courts have been held in open hearings for the last 30 years, before launching the reforms. He has said pursuing further transparency in family courts is a subject close to his heart. He issued guidance in January 2014 aimed at encouraging judges to publish their judgments on the judicial website Bailii in redacted and anonymised forms to protect the identities of children. But the guidance only applied to the top level of judges and in the vast majority of family cases heard by district judges and magistrates, judgments are not published. According to Ministry of Justice figures, 225,590 cases were completed in the family court in 2015, almost half of which were divorce cases. In the same year, judges published 469 judgments on Bailii. Prof Julie Doughty, lecturer in law at Cardiff University, who is being funded by Nuffield to research transparency in the family courts, said current measures did not go far enough. “The judicial guidance of 2014 hasn’t ended the perception and allegations of secrecy in the family courts,” she said. “I don’t think you get transparency through publishing judgments on Bailii. To get transparency you have to present it in a way people can understand and make sense of quickly. Bailii does not really help the system become more transparent at all.” In a consultation document issued to lawyers in 2014, called Transparency: the next steps, Munby acknowledged the profession’s “nervousness” about further moves to increase transparency. But he said there was a need for greater openness to improve public understanding of the court process and confidence in the court system. “The public has a legitimate interest in being able to read what is being done by the judges in its name,” he told lawyers. He is likely to announce progress in the new year on the two key reforms in the consultation document: a pilot of family hearings being held in public, and the release of documents to the media. The latter will include case summaries, skeleton arguments of the case, documents which are issued during fact-finding hearings – for example where allegations of domestic violence have been made – and experts’ reports, to allow the media to perform their watchdog role in society, he said. Munby has already canvassed initial views on the public hearings and if he gives the go-ahead for the trial, it will go out to further consultation with the profession. But responses to his consultation were almost universally hostile. The proposals were rejected by the Association of Lawyers for Children, which has 1,400 members, the Family Law Bar Association, Resolution, the national family lawyers’ association, and Family Justice Young People’s Board, a group of young people who have had direct experience of the family justice system. Cris McCurley, a family lawyer who specialises in representing black and minority ethnic women in cases involving extreme domestic violence, said holding hearings in open court could stop vulnerable women taking part in hearings. “Family courts hear intimate personal details and even with anonymity imposed I think the particulars of cases would be identifiable certainly within their communities,” she said. “My worry is it would stop women coming forward to seek help to protect their children.” Lucy Reed, a family law barrister, who runs the Transparency Project, which aims to increase understanding of the system, said opening up the courts further should be an issue for parliament to discuss. A spokesman for the judicial communications office said Munby intended to issue further guidance on the issues raised in his August 2014 consultation on transparency in the new year.",diasaster:0},

She urged people to consider those in need of help or company over Christmas. “I would encourage everyone to take the time to check on a friend or neighbour who is on their own.

I was conceived a month or so before D-day, which may be proof. The RSC's new production of The Tempest was a wonder well worth the fare to Stratford and the cost of a B&B When I was growing up, people remembered the war for its death and blackouts. But they recalled other people and episodes too: favourite radio comedians, visits to a treasured bit of countryside, the pleasant RAF fella they met on an overnight train. My own parents – how typically, I don’t know – spoke much more about that kind of thing than about El Alamein, Stalingrad and Herr Hitler. They spoke, in other words, about ordinary pleasures that had somehow been sustained, so that as a child my warlike view of the war – Spitfire v Messerschmitt in the school playground – had a counterpoint in parental memories of It’s That Man Again’s strange catchphrases, cycling holidays to north Wales, and how fresh the teatime poached eggs were at the boarding house in Largs. At the end of the bleakest and most ominous year I can remember, I offer this list in the same spirit: 10 things that have given me pleasure in 2016, to set against the ventriloquist-dummy rictus of Nigel Farage, the ruination of Syria, and the accelerating melt of Greenland’s ice sheet. 1. Cherries from Fife Facebook Twitter Pinterest Photograph: Nigel Cattlin/Alamy Cherries have always been my favourite fruit. Once they had a short season, late June to mid-July, and came almost entirely from Kent. Imports have made them available year round now, though to my mind New World cherries don’t have the bite and flavour of the European original. The idea that cherries can be grown as far north as Fife isn’t startling – I’ve eaten some grown on the shores of the Moray Firth. But last summer Co-op stores across Scotland were selling Fife cherries in plastic punnets, suggesting serious commercial cultivation. They were good too. 2. The Isles of Scilly We had never been before. One May afternoon I took the coastal path that circles the biggest island, St Mary’s, and in the early evening came to the bronze age burial chambers and iron age settlement at Halangy Down. There was nobody else about. Big white stones and clumps of pink thrift sat among the greensward that ran down to the beach; shadows from a low sun made the scene more than usually three-dimensional. It was a beautiful moment, of a kind that human beings must have enjoyed at the same spot 2,500 years ago. 3. A favourite sentence In an excellent New Statesman profile of Arron Banks, the Ukip patron who spent £7.5m on the leave campaign, Martin Fletcher wrote: “‘In 2001 he married again, this time to Ekaterina Paderina, known as Katya, a Russian … whom he met while attending a Britney Spears concert at the O2 Arena in London as the guest of an insurance firm.” (In fact, it was more likely to have been Wembley Arena; still, one gets the picture.) 4. Two good books Simon Winder’s Germania was informative and entertaining about German history and the author’s Germanophilia – a book more relevant now, perhaps, than when it was published six years ago. Maurice Walsh’s Bitter Freedom gave a memorably humane and non-partisan account of the struggle for Irish independence and the ensuing Irish civil war. Christmas, the season of goodwill to all men and cruelty to animals | Ian Jack Read more 5. Accrington Conservative Club During a stay with my in-laws in Lancashire, I took a notion to see this abandoned Grade II-listed building, which is often said to have been the biggest Conservative club in the country. Accrington had reached the peak of its prosperity as an engineering and cotton town when the club opened its doors in 1891, one of a series of buildings (including a rival Liberal club, a town hall and a market hall) that these days look far too grand for their melancholy surroundings. The Tories gave themselves a five-storey palace in the Jacobean style with a sprung dancefloor used latterly by a club called Churchill’s. It caught fire only a month or so after I saw it. Little now remains. 6. The Broadway musical I was lucky to see the Sheffield Crucible Theatre’s production of Show Boat, which ended its West End run four months early, despite enthusiastic reviews. Perhaps the trouble was the venue: the New London theatre has all the charm of an early Arndale centre. 7. Seaside encounters The Firth of Clyde gets far fewer holidaymakers than it deserves, and nearly everyone who goes is white. But that is beginning to change. This year I noticed Sikh families in Arran, Bengalis in Kintyre and amateur fishermen who looked to be of east Asian ancestry casting their lines at Tighnabruaich. Assets, too, are changing hands. A rich Malaysian gentleman has bought Rothesay’s splendid old hydropathic hotel, while one of the town’s smaller hotels now flies the Indian flag. Government reports flag up concerns over the failure of migrant and host communities to integrate, but there can be no better sign of integration than a willingness to join the stoic traditions of the Clyde holiday. 8. One fine story Facebook Twitter Pinterest Canadian author Alice Munro. Photograph: Alamy I came late to Alice Munro’s last collection, Dear Life. One of its stories, Dolly, is among the most perfect pieces of short fiction I’ve ever read. 9. One great play The Royal Shakespeare Company’s new production of The Tempest was a wonder well worth the fare to Stratford and the cost of a B&B. 10. Rus in urbe On the advice of Gavin Stamp I walked up the Darent valley in Kent, between the railway stations at Eynsford and Shoreham. London seemed far away, but in fact it lay just over the hill: the separation of town from country felt sudden and complete. The highlights included visits to an excavated Roman villa and to Lullingstone Castle, where the plant-hunter Tom Hart Dyke has established his World Garden of Plants, which he planned during the nine months he was held captive by guerrillas in the Colombian jungle. Hart Dyke told us about his ordeal as he led us round his extensive collection of flora. Few stranger experiences are to be had within 40 minutes of the capital.",diasaster:0},

The intention was to add Britain to the list of western countries hit in the past 12 months. An attack in 2017 is still deemed highly likely and the severe terrorist threat level is expected to remain. A source said: “There is an assumption that it won’t abate in 2017. People do not believe that it is going to get better.” The Guardian view on terror attacks: a proportionate response required | Editorial Read more In the last 30 months, since the rise of Isis in 2014, 11 Islamist attack plots on British soil have been identified and disrupted. Authorities in Britain believe there were four plots in 2016 aimed at inflicting mass casualties, all of which were shut down after arrests were made. Some are believed to have been inspired by Islamist propaganda. But there have been plots with direct involvement from Isis military planners in Syria, communicating with terrorists trying to attack the UK, investigators believe. Extra security measures were introduced in Britain after a truck attack on a Christmas market in Berlin killed 12 on Monday. Police and the National Crime Agency have launched their biggest effort to take guns off the street before terrorists can get hold of them. On Friday the NCA said the effort to capture illegal firearms had “never been a more significant priority”. Counter-terrorism detectives and MI5 are experiencing intense workloads as they track terrorist activity. More than 850 Britons are believed to have travelled to Syria after Isis declared a caliphate in August 2014. About 15% were killed while overseas, mostly while fighting for the terrorist group. An estimated 350 remain abroad. Of the remainder, the prime concern for counter-terrorism investigators is the estimated 300 people who went to train with Isis in Syria then returned to Britain. The rate of Britons going to join Isis in Syria has slowed, possibly because awareness campaigns, or that most of those minded to join have already done so. The rate of Britons returning from Syria has also slowed. Investigators believe that a former commander in charge of planning attacks on Europe, Abdelhamid Abaaoud, sent a fellow terrorist to British cities to plan an attack. Mohamed Abrini visited locations in Britain in 2015 including shopping centres in Birmingham and the Old Trafford stadium in Manchester. Abrini, since arrested over the attack on Brussels airport in March, claimed he was in the UK to collect money. The Guardian understands pictures taken during Abrini’s British trip were found on a phone belonging to Abaaoud, which were recovered by French authorities after the November 2015 attacks in Paris that killed 130, and which Abaaoud led. He was later killed by French police. Raffaello Pantucci, from the Royal United Services Institute, said: “Isis is very interested in hitting the UK, but it is harder, so they are going where it is easier. We’re likely to see a continuing level of threat we’ve seen in the last couple of years.” The threat has been mitigated by the fact Britain does not share extensive land borders with Europe and has tight gun laws. But throughout the past year the increasing availability of guns has been a growing concern. The rise of Isis and its threats to attack the west led Britain in 2014 to raise its terrorist threat level. “Severe” means the joint terrorism analysis centre believes an attack is highly likely.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Libyan hijackers surrender after release of hostages from plane diverted to Malta", "content": "Two men loyal to the late Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi hijacked a domestic flight with a replica hand grenade and pistols and forced the pilot to fly to Malta, reportedly claiming they wanted publicity for a new political party before letting passengers and crew leave the plane unharmed. The four-hour standoff with negotiators from Malta and Libya ended on Friday when the two men came out of the Afriqiyah Airways plane with a crewmember who was their final hostage, and were led away in handcuffs. The crew and 116 other passengers on board were allowed to leave the plane in batches, after which the Maltese prime minister, Joseph Muscat, tweeted: Joseph Muscat (@JosephMuscat_JM) Hijackers surrendered, searched and taken in custody. December 23, 2016 In a later tweet, he said initial examinations had shown that the weapons used were replicas. The Airbus A320, operated by the state-owned airline, was hijacked on an internal route between the cities of Sabha and Tripoli. During the negotiations, one of the hijackers told Libya’s Channel TV in a phone call that he headed a party supporting Gaddafi, and had organised the incident to promote the group. But the men’s exact demands, relayed to a team of Libyan and Maltese officials after Muscat spoke with his Libyan counterpart, remained unclear even after the negotiations were wrapped up. Muscat said the negotiators had refused to open discussions until all passengers had been released and denied a report from the Libyan foreign minister that the men had claimed political asylum. “The hijackers were told that in order for any discussions to be entertained, they should release all passengers first,” Muscat said. “This request was negotiated and eventually accepted and passengers were released in groups.” The men’s party was apparently called the New Al-Fateh, a reference to the 1969 coup that brought Gaddafi to power, Reuters reported. Photos from Malta appeared to show a hijacker standing outside the plane with a green flag like those used by Gaddafi supporters. Libya’s autocratic former leader was toppled and killed in a 2011 uprising, during which three of his sons also died. Since then, much of the oil-rich, sparsely populated country has descended into chaos. Rival governments are vying for control, with western nations backing the UN-brokered administration as the best hope for uniting Libya, while a parliament that meets in the far east refuses to accept the government’s authority.

Photograph: Darrin Zammit Lupi/Reuters The power vacuum has allowed affiliates of Islamic State and al-Qaida to take root and fuelled human trafficking along the coast. In recent years Libya’s beaches have become a key jumping-off point for migrants and refugees attempting the dangerous sea journey to Europe. The chaos in Libya may also have allowed the men to smuggle their weapons on board. The men initially told the pilot to fly to Malta, 220 miles (350km) north of Tripoli, but then briefly headed back towards Libya, and finally turned around again to land in Malta, an Afriqiyah Airways official said. The pilot had tried to persuade the hijackers to land in Libya, Reuters quoted a security source at the main airport as saying. “The pilot reported to the control tower in Tripoli that they were being hijacked, then they lost communication with him,” the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. “The pilot tried very hard to have them land at the correct destination.” All flights to and from Malta’s airport were cancelled or diverted during the standoff, and security forces gathered near the plane, which sat on the runway with its engines running long after it had landed. The Maltese president, Marie-Louise Coleiro Preca, appealed for calm. Marie-Louise Coleiro (@presidentMT) Following the news re #Afriqiyah Airways @Maltairport, I appeal for everyone to remain calm and follow official updates December 23, 2016 Negotiations were under way by early afternoon, and the first releases were announced soon after Muscat spoke to his Libyan counterpart, Fayez al-Sarraj. Malta has been a destination for hijackers before. In 1985, an EgyptAir flight from Athens to Cairo was forced to land on the island, where a 24-hour ordeal ended with the death of 60 hostages. Many of them were killed when Egyptian commandos stormed the plane in what was considered a botched operation.

Mintoff secured the release of 247 passengers and eight crewmembers in return for fuel, and the plane headed to Dubai, where the remaining hostages were released. In 1997, an Air Malta flight to Istanbul was hijacked by two men who used hoax bombs to force a landing in Germany. They surrendered peacefully after two hours of negotiations.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"World-renowned cellist Heinrich Schiff dies in Vienna", "content": "The Austrian cellist Heinrich Schiff, who performed with some of the world’s major orchestras before health problems led him to turn to conducting, has died at the age of 65. Ludwig Müller, of the Vienna Chamber Orchestra, told the Austrian Press Agency on Friday that Schiff died overnight in a hospital in the country’s capital. No cause of death was given. Most known for his mastery of the cello, his recordings of works by Bach, Shostakovich and Brahms earned him several prestigious music prizes. Later in life, Schiff turned increasingly to conducting after health problems ended his solo career. He appeared as a conductor with a host of orchestras, including the Los Angeles Philharmonic, the Philharmonia Orchestra and the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment, among many others. Schiff’s repertoire ranged from Vivaldi to contemporary masters such as Witold Lutosławski and Friedrich Cerha. The renowned cellist Steven Isserlis lamented the “terrible, terrible news” of Schiff’s death, adding that he was a “person with a core of true goodness and humanity; and a wonderfully serious, genuine musician”. In an interview with Slipped Disc last year, Isserlis recounted a story about Schiff that he said displayed the man’s “crystal intelligence and his unique sense of humour”. He told the website: “I was complaining (as usual) about the pressures of performing the Bach suites. He looked at me, and said quietly: ‘Bach saved my life’. “I asked him what he meant and he told me that a few years ago, he had a serious stroke, and was in danger of losing all mobility on his left side. As soon as he got to hospital, and realised what was happening, he started (almost instinctively, I imagine) to go through the fingerings of the Prelude to Bach’s first suite, moving his fingers ceaselessly to the imaginary music. He did this for about 20 hours a day, he thinks; and gradually his whole body came back to life, powered by those fingerings. “Today, you would never guess that he could have been half-paralysed, possibly even incapable of speech – or worse. The miracle of Bach – and of Heinrich.” The broadcaster Petroc Trelawny posted on Twitter: “Very sorry to hear of the death of Heinrich Schiff, master cellist and conductor.” In a 2012 interview, the cellist Natalie Clein, the first British winner of the Eurovision Competition for Young Musicians, told the Guardian it was “as if Schiff was born playing”. She said: “Schiff is a true cello animal. His hands seem to be moulded around the instrument … He has a Ferrari-like, 0-to-60 agility and power that’s thrilling, if a bit intimidating, when you are experiencing it close up. He taught me that there’s always something more to search for, that you can endlessly explore new colours and textures on the cello, so long as you are guided by the score. “He strikes the balance between individuality and faithfulness to a composition perfectly, maintaining a deep integrity and old-school seriousness. There is a high-voltage electricity in his vibrato, a breathlessness that keeps you endlessly listening; but his playing also has a sensitivity and a generosity of spirit that makes his sound instantly recognisable. His interpretations are ones to cherish and love.” According to Gramophone, Schiff was concerned by some modern interpretations of classical music, complaining in 1988 that it had been “very much mistreated”. He said: “Take the Mozart violin concertos. If you hear any of the top ten violinists playing them it’s beautiful sound, fine technique, but the style is hopelessly wrong - it’s almost a different language.” A customary four-star Guardian review of a 2007 performance in Bristol, said Schiff “seemed to transmit his Zen-like meditative approach to the audience, calming the senses and heightening perception of the music”. The review closed: The intimacy and immediacy... was intense, but Schiff’s demeanour was one of great humility, concerned only to suggest that Bach’s is the music of the spheres.”",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Trump's transition reality show: Kanye West, a naked cowboy and a month to go", "content": "Is it an alarming prelude, a nonsensical distraction, or simply an improbable work of pop-up theater with a daily run in the outsized lobby of a gaudy Manhattan skyscraper? After winning a presidential election like no other, Donald Trump has turned the period of transition, one of the world’s more sober and serious mass hiring programs, into a reality show set against a backdrop of 1980s brass and marble. In Trump Tower, at the base of the lobby’s five-storey, dribbling waterfall, an unprecedented drama of American politics is playing out. The hundreds of tourists from around the world who drop by each day sense it. The metal detectors and cordoned media scrum signal it. And the frequent appearance in the lobby of immediately recognizable stars – even if you don’t know who they are, you know they’re stars – confirms it. Donald Trump's presidential transition is basically reality television | Richard Wolffe Read more Only the Starbucks employees on the mezzanine level, and the guy who runs the souvenir shop in the basement next to the bathrooms, seem unimpressed. Trump could have done things differently, more discreetly. Barack Obama ran his transition from an anonymous headquarters in Chicago. George W Bush ran his from hastily requisitioned office space in Washington DC. Trump, whose résumé is padded with television producer credits, has chosen to run his as a mini-series, in which contestants must pass through the silent doors of a Trump-branded elevator and make an invisible ascent to meet their destinies. At the end of each meeting, the elevators deliver the contestants back to Earth, where some make a beeline for the cameras, while others scurry for the Fifth Avenue exits. Since November, those elevators have swallowed and disgorged an improbable procession of Americans glamorous and grotesque, plus assorted hangers-on: elected officials, an ebullient Nigel Farage, at least four National Football League heroes, two former vice-presidents, a bunch of generals, the founder of the World Economic Forum, a passel of Silicon Valley billionaires, and the rapper/entrepreneur Kanye West, who explained to fans on Twitter afterward: “I feel it is important to have a direct line of communication with our future President if we truly want change.” Some of them came for job interviews. The main work of any White House transition, after all, is to field a team for the work ahead, running a superpower. Thus the presence in the lobby of Mitt Romney, the previous Republican presidential nominee, who was hoping for a nod as secretary of state, it turns out pitifully; and of Ben Carson, the retired neurosurgeon, who declared himself unqualified to lead any federal agency and was promptly handed the urban development file. Facebook Twitter Pinterest The next album cover? Trump and West meet at Trump Tower. Photograph: Drew Angerer/Getty Images What is Trump up to? He has not merely been parading erstwhile enemies, with the intent of publicly shaming them, the way American police parade criminal suspects. Why should Trump force stalwarts such as Rudy Giuliani, the former mayor of New York City, and Laura Ingraham, a conservative radio host, to walk past cameras to apply for jobs not reserved for them? There are, after all, back entrances to the tower, which Trump himself mostly uses to slip in and out. Romney had to sit through dinner with Trump and make his way through an expensive plate of scallops as he grimaced for the camera, realizing he had lost all opportunity to ever again take a credible principled stand against the “phoney” he had called too dangerous to be allowed inside the Oval Office. Al Gore, the former vice-president turned global warming Cassandra, met with Trump for 90 minutes in early December, describing to reporters afterwards an “extremely interesting conversation”. Two days later, Trump tapped a climate change denier who has worked as a state-level hatchet man for fossil fuel companies to run the environmental protection agency. A week later, Trump picked the head of ExxonMobil to run the state department (sorry, Romney). Facebook Twitter Pinterest A guide to Donald Trump’s potential cabinet of billionaires The president-elect’s instinct has been to encourage spectacle, at a level other presidents-elect have reserved for inauguration day. That explains, if anything can, the persistent and apparently welcome presence in the Trump tower lobby of the street performer known as the Naked Cowboy, who at some point over the course of the last year began modifying his trademark underwear with a single bold word painted across his ass: “Trump.” (The joke is lost on Americans.) American democracy is being derailed. Can faith be restored? | Richard Wolffe Read more Notes by a reporter, assigned one day on behalf of the media at large to surveil the scene at the tower, capture one cowboy encounter. “Naked Cowboy came over and sang a song about Trump that included lyrics about blue lives mattering and Trump putting thugs in jail,” wrote the reporter, John Stanton, of BuzzFeed. “Also about how bad Obamacare is. And how Trump Tower is the greatest place on earth. “He then picked up a tourist, cradled her in his arms, and kissed her. There’s not acid strong enough for this to be a hallucination, I assure you.” To say that Trump appreciates a spectacle is not to say that he is always eager to face the cameras. At the end of November, he announced a press conference to take place two weeks hence, in which he would describe his plan for divesting from his businesses to foreclose any conflicts of interests potentially arising from his assumption of a role in which his words – or, more likely, his tweets – might move the US economy. Trump canceled the press conference, explaining, again on Twitter, that these were “busy times!” In this, he has struck another contrast with his immediate predecessors, who frequently addressed the country as they prepared to lead it. Obama held 18 news conferences during his transition. Bush, whose transition was unusually short owing to the Florida recount, held 11. Trump has held zero. During the 1828 US presidential transition, Andrew Jackson’s wife died, his steamboat was mobbed, and partygoers trampled mud in the White House. Hundreds of savings banks collapsed during Franklin Roosevelt’s transition. Seven states seceded from the union during Abraham Lincoln’s. To date, Trump has merely installed a friend of Vladimir Putin as America’s top diplomat and successfully provoked China. But his transition still has almost one month to run.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"No sex please, we're Japanese: love hotels clean up their act amid falling demand", "content": "While Japanese families enjoy the Christmas Eve ritual of tucking into fried chicken and sponge cake, millions of love-struck, or simply lustful, couples will discreetly observe another festive tradition with a visit to a love hotel. They will enter a dimly lit lobby and, after a brief discussion, select a room with the push of a button. Then, for just a few thousand yen ($25-30) – handed to an unseen receptionist – they will be free to make the most of their fleeting moment of privacy. As soon as they leave, a team of cleaners will prepare the room for the next occupants. For Japan’s ‘stranded singles’, virtual love beats the real thing Read more But Japan’s love hotels are suffering from a downturn in demand from amorous couples. Instead, they are pinning their hopes of long-term survival on a surge in the number of Chinese tourists that is stretching the traditional hotel industry to breaking point. The backstreets of Tokyo’s Dogenzaka – nicknamed Love Hotel Hill – are quiet early on a weekday evening. But on Saturday, rooms at hotels with names like Amore, Elegance and Asian Resort will be at a premium as the industry cashes in on its busiest day of the year. From huge, faux castles strategically located at motorway intersections to scruffy ferroconcrete boxes in the suburbs, love hotels offer not just privacy and anonymity, but an array of esoteric extras for couples hoping to spice up their love life. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Love Hotel Hill in Tokyo is geared up for the busiest time of year, but demand is falling as more young couples live away from home. Photograph: Justin McCurry for the Guardian If mirrored ceilings and vending machines selling sex toys are not their thing, guests can opt for “concept rooms” that re-create everything from the inside of an aircraft to tropical holiday resorts. An estimated 1.4 million Japanese visit a love hotel every day, with rooms used by an average of 2.4 couples daily. Although there are no official data, analysts believe the industry is worth between 2-3 trillion yen ($17-25bn) a year. Yet these are uncertain times for love hotels, so named after the first of their kind – Hotel Love – opened in Osaka in the late 1960s. The rise of single households and a decline in the population of 20-29 year olds – their target demographic – means there is less call for the role love hotels once played as an escape from extended families living under one roof. “The love hotel business is going through a difficult time,” said Shigemi Sudo, director of the Tokyo Hotel and Ryokan (Inn) Association. “This is probably because more young people live away from their family home these days, so there’s no need for them to go to a love hotel.” Helped by government subsidies, more love hotels are renovating their facilities to appeal to overseas visitors who may not want a room with a revolving bed and fluffy handcuffs. A record 20 million tourists visited Japan this year, thanks to a weaker yen and groups of visitors from China, who make up just under a third of the total. Having reached that milestone four years ahead of schedule, the government has set an ambitious target of 40 million by the time Tokyo hosts the Olympics in 2020. With international and tourists hotels unable to cope with demand, the accommodation gap is being filled by capsule hotels, backpackers’ hostels, Airbnb – and love hotels.

Photograph: Yoshikazu Tsuno/AFP/Getty Images Eager to rid themselves of their association with purely carnal desires, some advertise themselves as boutique hotels or “urban resorts”. The number of hotels with an overtly sexual theme has dwindled to around 6,000 due to falling domestic demand and a 1985 law that required the industry to present a more wholesome image. Dimly lit receptions have been replaced with cafeterias; in the rooms, tacky décor and vending machines selling sex toys have made way for bright colours and designer cosmetics. Hotel Will in Saitama prefecture, for example, has retained its garish neon sign outside, but inside the pink wallpaper has been replaced with plain white, and the double beds with singles. A widescreen TV and refrigerator now take up space once occupied by huge mirrors. Only the well-appointed bathroom has been left untouched. The hotel is packed with Chinese tourists, thanks to a contract with a Chinese travel agency giving it exclusive use for its clients. “Many tourists don’t think love hotels are seedy at all,” said Mark Schreiber, a veteran writer on Japan’s sex industry. “Operators spend a fortune on fixtures, which are different in each room. One might be done out art deco-style, and the room next store might have a Renaissance theme.” Hotel operator Manryo has turned three love hotels in Tokyo’s Asakusa district hotels into backpackers’ hostels by adding a bar and lounge. “It just so happened the love hotels became available to us after they got into financial difficulties,” said Manryo spokeswoman Erika Yamato. Almex, meanwhile, advertises love hotel rooms to tourists via loveinnjapan.com. The English-language site includes a manga guide for first-time guests, and there are plans to launch versions in Korean and Chinese. In pictures: Tokyo love hotels Read more “Tourists are starting to use love hotels because regular hotels are fully booked, or sometimes just because they’ve heard that they are fun places to stay,” an Almex spokesman said. Rooms that can be rented for a few hours at a time have been around in Japan since the Edo period (1603-1868). The first modern love hotels appeared in the 1960s to cater to couples desperate to escape their extended families, who traditionally lived under one roof, for a few hours of intimacy. An Osaka-based association of small and medium-sized hotel operators believes love hotels can provide accommodation for an additional 28 million overnight guests a year, according to the Asahi Shimbun. “Foreign tourists generally come away from their first stay at a love with a positive impression, and guidebooks all describe them as luxurious, clean and spacious,” said Schreiber. “And you get all of that for much less than a night at the Hilton.”",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"What does Hope not Hate actually do?", "content": "This week, former Ukip leader Nigel Farage accused the widower of the Labour MP Jo Cox of having links to extremism. The “extremists” in question are the anti-racist group Hope not Hate, an organisation supported by Brendan Cox through his wife’s memorial fund. “He backs organisations like Hope Not Hate, who masquerade as being lovely and peaceful, but actually pursue violent and undemocratic means,” Farage told LBC Radio on Tuesday. Hope not Hate said it might take legal action in response, and has begun crowdfunding for its legal costs. The group’s chief executive, Nick Lowles, says he has been overwhelmed by the support. “For a lot of people, including ourselves, there is a wider issue. People are horrified by the toxic nature of our political debate, certainly in terms of what has gone on in Britain and in the US – and this is just one example of it.” Lowles says they have received thousands of donations, not just from existing backers, but from the general public. Though it has also exposed them to new attacks from online trolls, the controversy has significantly raised the group’s profile, making many more people interested in what they do. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Farage accuses Brendan Cox of backing extremist groups In November, I went to a Hope not Hate event at a mosque in Cardiff – a three-hour workshop on how to challenge and discuss anti-migrant and prejudiced sentiments. It drew a crowd of around 20, one or two of them local muslims and a few with migrant backgrounds, but the majority were white Welsh, many of whom had not previously been in a mosque. The organiser, Jonathan, began the session by asking what had prompted people to attend. Many described feeling worried, frustrated and in need of a toolkit for discussing race and immigration with family, friends and colleagues. “What usually happens is I either move the conversation on to something else, or I get angry,” said Amy (some names have been changed), a 30-year-old with family roots in Wales. “I want a third way.” One woman in her 50s, from a village in the south Wales valleys, said she was struggling to discuss these issues with her fellow allotment gardeners. A younger man living in Cardiff worried that facts and statistics were no longer getting through to people he spoke to. Next we split into groups to draw a chart of the kind of opinions we would expect to find in the wider public about migration, and in what sort of numbers. Afterwards, the organiser shared with us Hope Not Hate’s research on public opinion around migration, explaining that, while there may be a very vocal “hostile” camp, most people in Britain are in the neutral section of the spectrum – perhaps holding concerns, but not with strong animosity. We then took part in some roleplays, practising listening skills and conversation techniques such as asking open questions that encourage broad responses, rather than a simple yes or no. “We don’t have all the answers, but we know two things work,” explains Jonathan later. “One is listening to people, to challenge prejudice constructively. The second is building an inclusive narrative through shared action.” The former, he explains, is about being respectful and creating space for open discussion. The second is recognition that this work has to be community-led, finding shared pursuits and common ground. Sarah, a Welsh woman in her 40s, told the group she had been struggling with racist conversations, including with her own family. “People have become more open about saying these things,” she said. Afterwards, she spoke of having more usable strategies. “Being in that meeting gave me support that I’m not on my own – because sometimes you do think, ‘Is it just me, am I the only one that doesn’t think this way?’” After the workshop, some participants joined a small group of volunteers to go door-knocking. They travelled to the Adamsdown neighbourhood of the city, near one of Wales’s four asylum-seeker dispersal areas. Adamsdown is a low-income, inner-city area of Cardiff; the idea of door-knocking along its terraced streets on a Saturday afternoon was to put some of the techniques picked up into practice – to start the conversations. Facebook Twitter Pinterest An anti-BNP meeting organised by Hope Not Hate in Barking in 2010. Photograph: Frantzesco Kangaris You might think this exercise could result in a lot of swiftly shut doors, but Jonathan says most people are happy to talk (“as long as you’re not a politician, a salesman or from the council”). Using events at a local centre for asylum-seekers and refugees as a conversation starter, the door-knockers encountered a range of views. There was the couple who wanted to support the centre, and the man in his 60s who was deeply hostile; in between were the ambivalent or anxious – the target group. “Everyone seems surprised that we are asking these questions,” says volunteer Sian. “I was pleased we were able to have the conversations – nobody slammed doors in our faces. It’s reassuring that we can go to doorsteps with this complicated and turbulent issue.” It’s this sort of slow, grassroots effort that Hope not Hate considers vital in post-Brexit Britain. Their concern is that, in the absence of such engagement, an opportunistic, populist right will find it easier to take hold. In May this year, Ukip took seven seats in the Welsh assembly – before then, it had zero. Jonathan says that, since November, there have been two more training sessions in Cardiff, and others in Swansea and Newport. Volunteers have also been door-to-door several times in Adamstown, where some of the locals who initially expressed doubts about the area’s refugee centre attended its Christmas bazaar a few weeks ago. Workshops are oversubscribed and attendees have included local activists from Plaid Cymru, Labour and the Lib Dems – as well as people with no background in politics. There are 18 more Hope Not Hate events planned across the UK in the new year, including in Manchester, Liverpool, Derby, Bristol, Swindon and Sheffield. “Recruitment is not a problem at the moment,” says Jonathan. “It’s just something that people really want.”",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Christmas Day? Groundhog Day? I can’t tell the difference", "content": "One Sunday evening in late November, I popped in at the house of a couple I know, on a whim. At that point, hard as it now is to believe, I had barely registered Christmas was coming. My friends had, though. Marion – let’s call her – had a large pile of colourful sundries to the left of her on the table she sat at, and four equally large piles of small gold-and-white parcels, beautifully wrapped and be-ribboned, ranged across the back of the table. Bob – let’s call him – was emptying the tumble dryer and folding the clothes, I felt rather pointedly. “Oh my God,” I said, as anyone would. “What on earth are you doing?” “Oh, just getting the stockings done for the kids,” replied Marion. Part of me knew that this was really quite eccentric. Part of me felt like The Worst Mother In The World. At which point Bob interceded. “We don’t have any kids, Marion. They are all adults. And even when they were children, there were only three of them. They’ve already amassed about 90 Christmases of stocking-fillers between them. A lot of them are still up there in the bedrooms they haven’t used for up to a decade.” “Oh come on, Bob,” said Marion, “I can’t just give our kids stockings and not give one to Ursula.” Let’s call her. Ursula, I’m told, is the eldest child’s new girlfriend. She’s from Australia and isn’t going home for Christmas, so she’s coming too. Ursula is 32. “We’ve only met her once, for five minutes,” says Bob, aggressively tucking gussets under his chin and folding pants. Facebook Twitter Pinterest ‘Oh, nobody uses actual stockings, do they?’ Photograph: Stephen Swintek/Getty Images Ultra-hypersensitive as I am, I detect some marital tension. Mindful of the fact that in a few weeks I’ll be putting together some hasty, desultory, borderline-insulting stocking-fillers myself, I decide to side with Bob. “You’ll have trouble fitting that lot into stockings anyway, Marion. That lot would do for an entire orphanage.” “Oh, nobody uses actual stockings, do they?” Marion counters breezily. “We use pillowcases, of course. Look. I’ve got these red flannel ones.” Marion smooths one out on the table, and starts inscribing the eldest “child’s” name very neatly on the first red flannel pillowcase. This is particularly uncomfortable for me as, yes, I actually do use stockings, quite small ones. Anyway, Bob and I gaze in horrified wonder as Marion carefully inks all four giant pillowcases, then we beg her to stop and we drink a bottle of wine between us in 20 minutes flat. I wander home in a daze, repeating to myself again and again: “You are the normal one, you are the normal one … Jesus, one of those ‘kids’ is a barrister.” By the time I get home, I’ve managed to forget once again that Christmas, at this point, needs to be thought about at all. Yet, I’ve had cause to recall that scene time and time again, as Christmas has crept closer. It’s my first Christmas with a child who has reached adulthood, and a lot of my friends are in a similar position. We have all been amazed to realise that, despite leaving home, all of them seem to want exactly the same Christmas as they’ve always had. When I posted the obligatory Christmas tree snap on Instagram, my 19-year-old responded immediately from far-off Salford with: “You decorated the tree … WITHOUT ME!!!” I swear that it’s at least a decade since he did anything other than sit around looking bored, saying he’ll flush out a multi-plug “in a minute” and occasionally remarking, querulously, something like: “Where’s that Santa I made in year three?” 7 ways to have fun with the family at Christmas Read more The tree, in fact, seems to be a particular issue. One friend reported: “I mentioned to Frankie that, because we’d be away for Christmas I thought, I wouldn’t bother with a tree. Her face fell.” This parent later emailed me a photograph of a very tall, very beautiful, very stylish tree, covered in sparkly white decorations, just to let me know she’d fully surrendered. Or there was: “I asked the kids whether they thought we should just get an artificial tree this year and they totally freaked out.” And: “I told Bert I thought we’d just have a little tree this year and you’d think I’d just told him I had cancer.” Even my friend who actually does have cancer got short shrift from the family when she suggested that maybe the tree was something that, just for this rather difficult year, could perhaps be managed without. They did concede that they could probably organise it themselves – only for this year – provided instructions were given. In essence, Marion was absolutely right, if a little previous, while Bob and I were totally wrong. All I can say to parents looking forward to their first Christmas with a sentient toddler is this: take care that you don’t get too carried away. The Christmas you make for your little one this year will be the Christmas you will be making for your little one until you’re so old that someone has to cut your turkey up and feed it to you.

In October, IG sent a selection of four specially selected cracker designs to Buckingham Palace so that the Queen could choose one to grace her Christmas table. Its products may be swathed in glitter, but the factory in Ystrad Mynach, a short drive from Newport, is an example of gritty British survival against the odds.

Photograph: Tom Smith Previously IG had three sites – one where wrap was printed, one where it spun huge printed reels of paper onto cardboard tubes and another where goods were packed up ready for stores. The group spent £8m on bringing the whole operation together in one site two years ago. It switched to using more environmentally friendly and efficient water-based inks and introduced new processes that can add glitzy touches such as holograms and shiny finishes. “In 2008 we had to seriously think whether we could make this a viable facility,” says Fineman. “It was loss-making and had a lot of issues. We had choices and one of those choices would have been that this place didn’t have a future as a manufacturing site. But we felt if we could remodel, find different customers and channels and create a sufficient resource to invest that not only could we survive but it would be very profitable. It was very challenging but it is working.” IG’s enormous printing machines have 10 heads that layer ink onto a polymer roll on which the design has been laser cut so it stands proud like a giant potato print. Paper from reels more than 1m thick is fed through the printing system before being dried in a long oven and then sliced in half as it is spun back into another thick roll. The plant can print 72km of paper an hour, and employs up to 450 people at peak times about half of whom work in manufacturing. From September the printing machines are working 24/7 right up until Christmas week to cope with late orders from British retailers. Production restarts for next Christmas almost immediately and shipping begins from June or July with boxes of wrapping paper packed off to Bristol docks and shipped over the Atlantic. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Tom Smith Christmas crackers Photograph: Tom Smith The company is having a good year. Underlying sales were up more than a fifth in the six months to the end of September with profits up 36% as gift bag sales soared. Fineman says the fall in sterling will bring another boost. “The UK is going to be a very uncertain place. But over the next 12 to 18 months UK manufacturing, the number of cards sold is up 5% year on year. “Sending Christmas cards has declined other than single cards to close relatives. “People aren’t just writing out cards to their colleagues at work. But there are new occasions and reasons to send cards all the time. People just see a card and think ‘that’s fun’ and get it. There doesn’t have to be a specific reason any longer.” IG is also trying the same trick with crackers – with versions for Halloween and Easter. Some of the crackers are designed in Wales but they are made at the company’s factory in China from which it ships to 29 countries. Last year it imported 60m crackers to the UK – nearly one for every person in the country. And who writes the jokes? The company employs a network of freelancers, but anyone can contribute an idea. Even Fineman claims to have contributed a couple over the years, although he won’t reveal what they are. Maybe it’s the one about “tinsel-itis”.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"School cleaners who went on strike over pay sacked before Christmas", "content": "Three long-serving primary school cleaners, who went on strike over claims their wages and conditions were cut when a private company took over the contract, have been sacked days before Christmas. The women – Lesley Leake, Marice Hall and Karen McGee – sparked a debate over outsourcing when they went on strike for 14 weeks after their school in West Yorkshire was turned into an academy earlier this year. Known as the “Kinsley cleaners”, the women said they had their wages cut from £7.85 an hour to the minimum wage of £7.20 once the contract switched from Wakefield council to C&D Cleaning in April. The women, who between them have more than 28 years’ experience cleaning Kinsley primary school, returned to work earlier this month. But on Thursday they were told they had been sacked. Jeremy Corbyn said he was angered by the news of the cleaners’ dismissal. “When I met them, they explained how their wages were cut following the outsourcing of their contracts to a private company,” the Labour leader said. “Outsourcing is bad for our public services and workers. The cleaners’ jobs must be brought back in-house with fair pay and conditions. The race to the bottom in wages and working conditions faced by huge numbers of workers right across Britain is a national disgrace and Labour would put a stop to it.” Dave Prentis, the Unison general secretary, said the women had bravely taken action to protect their wages and employment rights. “To then sack them just days before Christmas is heartless in the extreme,” he said, adding that the union would be consulting lawyers over the decision to dismiss them. Speaking to the Guardian in October, Leake – who has two adult children and a second job – said her pension, sick pay and holiday entitlement had also been hit by the outsourcing. “The first month [under C&D Cleaning] when we got our payslips we just thought it could be a few teething problems, but the second month it was the same, and it just went on and on,” she said. The women said they had tried to raise the issues with C&D Cleaning but were “fobbed off”. In the end the three got in touch with their union, Unison, but C&D Cleaning, based in nearby Barnsley, was reluctant to discuss the women’s cases. In one email seen by the Guardian, the company’s head of human resources, Nick Thorpe, replied to Unison: “I understand … the impact for you as an organisation when members realise that we are no longer living in the 1980s and they question the actual value of union membership when you have no say, power or influence over their employer.” The three women decided to go on strike, staging their first picket outside the school at the beginning of September. “It was a bit scary at first because none of us have ever done anything like this, but we didn’t know what else we could do,” said Leake. “It wasn’t just the money we were losing, it was the stress that was affecting us and our families as well.” A statement from C&D Cleaning read: “The employees were invited to a disciplinary hearing on an earlier date in December to respond to allegations of gross misconduct. At the employees’ request, the hearing took place on 19 December 2016 as their chosen Unison representative was not available on the earlier date. “Full details of the allegations were provided to the employees in advance of the hearing. The employees and their representative were given full opportunity to put their cases. The outcome of the hearing was termination of employment. The individuals have been informed of their right of appeal. The company will not comment further at this stage so as not prejudice any internal process.” Jon Trickett, the local MP, said all the “three courageous women” had done was stand up for their right to work. “With only days until Christmas, it looks like Scrooge has been brought back to life from Victorian times and ruined the festive period for three families in my constituency,” he said. He said the women’s experiences were unfortunately common. “Our country needs better pay, better conditions and better corporate governance to make sure that all employees are treated fairly,” he said. “It is also time that we stopped outsourcing services paid for by the taxpayer to rogue employers.”",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Berlin attacker manhunt ends in shootout but questions remain", "content": "The hunt for Europe’s most wanted man ended in a gun battle outside a Milan train station in the early hours of Friday but left authorities facing tough questions about how an armed suspected terrorist had been able to travel hundreds of miles on public transport before being caught. Italy’s interior minister, Marco Minniti, said on Friday that the man shot in Milan was “without a shadow of a doubt” Anis Amri, who is suspected of carrying out Monday’s terrorist attack on a Berlin Christmas market. Fingerprints of the shot man matched those secured from within the cabin of the truck used to carry out the attack, German authorities confirmed. Amri was stopped by two police officers in a routine check in the Sesto San Giovanni neighbourhood on the outskirts of the city and was asked for his documents, Minniti said. Amri initially told the officers he did not have documents and that he was from Calabria. When pressed further, Amri slipped his hand into his bag and retrieved a .22-calibre gun, shooting 36-year-old officer Christian Movio in the shoulder. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Milan police kill Berlin attack suspect in shootout Berlin Christmas market attack: a graphical guide to what we know so far Read more A second officer, 29-year-old Luca Scatà, returned fire, shooting Amri in the chest. The Tunisian 24-year-old reportedly died of his wounds about 10 minutes later, in spite of attempts at resuscitation. Movio remains in hospital with a wound to his shoulder that is not life-threatening. Minniti said he told the wounded officer “Italians will be able to have a happier holiday. All of Italy should be proud of him … It’s not simple to guarantee an adequate level of security faced with the threat of terrorism, but we are putting everything into it.” Angela Merkel, who was alerted to the news of Amri’s death by the Italian prime minister, Paolo Gentiloni, on Friday morning, thanked the Italian officers and said she had asked for an investigation into “each and every aspect of the case of Mr Amri”. Wherever there was a need for a political or legislative change, it would be done speedily, the German chancellor said. The fact that a man whose terrorist leanings were known to German spy agencies had dropped off their radar before the attack and managed to evade police while travelling at least 1,000 miles around the continent in spite of a European arrest warrant raised difficult questions for security agencies and politicians across Europe. Paris-based web portal Monde Afrique on Friday claimed the Moroccan intelligence agency had twice alerted German authorities to Amri’s “fervent” support for Islamic State and his contact with two of their representatives in advance of Monday’s attack, once on 19 September and again on 11 October. A video posted on Friday by Isis’s Amaq news agency, in which Amri pledged his allegiance to Isis leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi and called for Isis supporters to take revenge against “crusaders” bombing Muslims, appeared to be shot with a mobile phone on the Kieler bridge in Berlin’s Moabit district, just over a mile from the German chancellery. The bridge is also located only a short distance from the ThyssenKrupp warehouse near where Polish truck driver Łukasz Urban on Monday parked the articulated lorry that was used to plough into the Breitscheidplatz Christmas market later that evening. “It simply cannot be the case that someone like Amri was able to move around Germany freely even though he was suspected of planning a terrorist attack,” said Michael Ortmann, a terrorist expert for broadcaster RTL. “Our intelligence agencies have fallen asleep at the wheel,” Ortmann told the Guardian, pointing to the fact that Germany had experienced a lack of terrorist activity for many decades since the decline of the Red Army Faction, also known as the Baader-Meinhof gang. Spy agencies were often understaffed and technologically behind the times, he said, making it difficult for regional police to share data. How Amri managed to travel from Berlin in the north of the continent to Milan in the south remains unclear. German and Italian media reported that a French rail ticket was found in Amri’s backpack, suggesting that he had boarded a train in the city of Chambéry in the northern French Alps, near both the Swiss and Italian borders. From Chambéry, Amri appeared to have travelled by train for two and a half hours to the northern Italian city of Turin, before taking another train to Milan. French media on Friday offered a different theory, reporting that Amri had travelled from Lyon to Chambéry by train, then a direct high-speed TGV to Milan. Alain Acco (@Alain_Acco) INFO #E1 Le terroriste de Berlin a pris le train hier entre Lyon Part Dieu et Chambéry, puis le TGV de 17h44 qui est arrivé à 21h50 à Milan December 23, 2016 Travelling directly from Germany to France by train, Amri would have run a considerable risk of detection. After last year’s thwarted train attack in which a 27-year-old Moroccan jihadi opened fire on a Thalys train from Amsterdam to Paris, security on certain French and international train services has been stepped up, with passengers having to go through metal-detection scanners on some platforms. But not all train services or stations scan passengers before boarding. According to Tagesspiegel newspaper, Berlin police had calculated that their suspect would have been unable to travel far beyond the German capital’s borders, citing eyewitness reports according to which Amri had sustained visible facial injuries during Monday’s attack. However, several companies run coach services from the centre of Berlin to the French Alps. FlixBus, for example, runs a coach service that departs at 11.45pm on Monday from Berlin’s central station and arrives in Annecy, near Chambéry, at 8.10pm the following day. Though passengers are required to carry a valid passport to board such coaches, their ID documents are checked only by the driver, who is not usually qualified to verify their authenticity. FlixBus declined to comment on whether Amri could have travelled on board one of its buses, referring the Guardian to the criminal investigator. By the time Amri arrived in Milan, he reportedly had only a couple of hundred euros left in his wallet, which has led Italian investigators to presume he had been hoping to hide nearby. Italy was familiar territory to Amri, and that may explain why he headed back to the country following Monday’s attack. He is believed to have arrived in Italy as one of tens of thousands of Tunisians who entered the country after the Arab spring protests in 2011. Merkel said she had spoken to the Tunisian president and that progress had been made in the process of sending back Tunisian refugees who had no right to stay in Germany. “We can be relieved that one acute threat has come to an end, but the threat that comes from terrorism – that is a general threat – continues,” she said.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"If Theresa May can't trust the Queen, it bodes ill for their future relationship", "content": "When a leak emerges from Buckingham Palace, and especially when that leak tells us what the Queen supposedly thinks, interest is unsurprisingly intense. Regal unknowability – as exemplified in the recent Netflix series The Crown, where the young Elizabeth II is portrayed as learning that she must stay publicly above the fray at all times – is an essential part of our image of the royal family, and so any claimed breaches in the facade are bound to be studied closely. On Friday, one such incident provoked strong interest among royal watchers: the news reported in the Times that the Queen was “disappointed” in Theresa May for refusing to tell her about her plans for Brexit, attributed to a “source close to the monarch”. How seriously should such leaks be taken? And who would reveal such a confidence? To understand the provenance of any leak, the first question is: who benefits? If it was a senior courtier passing on palace gossip, the intention will have been to indicate a touch of monarchical exasperation at the government’s evident lack of a plan (the Queen would not be the only one). But it won’t have been officially authorised and the one certainty is that the Queen will not have been amused. In reality, the latest leak is more about May than the Queen. It confirms what Westminster gossip has long held: that the PM is a laborious decision-maker, almost to the point of constipation, and that her government – at least in September – had little idea how to go about Brexit. If May thought she could not take even the Queen into her confidence, it does not bode well for their future relationship. The Queen’s relationship with her prime ministers – Theresa May is the 13th – has always been a source of speculation, not least because their discussions, including the weekly meetings, are confidential. Usually, no third person is present and no notes are taken. The Queen does not leak her views and certainly does not give a running commentary, so any gossip about what has passed between them can normally be traced to political sources. What her more recent prime ministers know is that she has more experience of British and world affairs than any of them. Her first prime minister, Winston Churchill, was born in 1874, while three of her four most recent PMs were born after her reign had begun. She has seen every state paper and intelligence report since 1952 and met every minister and senior MP, as well as a quarter of all the US presidents who have ever lived, six popes and most world leaders and celebrities – and she has never publicly gossiped about any of them. The Queen tends to get on best with ministers who are confident enough to relax and gossip with her; she is thought to have got on best with characters like Macmillan and Wilson and less well with Thatcher, who – as Queen Victoria said of Gladstone – tended to lecture her as if she was a public meeting. She liked Alec Douglas-Home (a Scottish landowner like herself) and apparently David Cameron – younger than any of her children – despite his incautious leaking of her views on the Scottish referendum result in 2014, when he told the mayor of New York that she had purred down the phone when he called her with the outcome. (Cameron’s boast was probably an exaggeration, as she’d already have known the outcome by then – she listens to the BBC.) Stephen Bates wrote about the royal family for the Guardian for 12 years.

{ "title":"Sir Mota Singh obituary", "content": "My brother Sir Mota Singh, who has died aged 86, was the first ethnic minority judge in England when he was appointed in 1982. He forsook the traditional judge’s wig for a turban when sitting at Southwark crown court, London, where he served for more than 20 years. He was born in Nairobi, Kenya, the eldest of seven children – he had five brothers and a sister – of Dalip Singh Matharu, a garage proprietor, and his wife, Harnam. Aged 16 Mota was forced to assume responsibility for the family when his father was fatally wounded while defending a woman from an attack. Academically gifted, he was encouraged by his teachers to complete his education, despite being the family breadwinner. He took a clerical position with a firm of advocates in Nairobi and then enrolled with Lincoln’s Inn, London, as a foreign student. In 1953, accompanied by his wife, Swaran, and young daughter, he set sail from Mombasa for London to complete his bar exams. He continued to work during the day, as a clerk at the Indian high commission. He returned to Kenya in 1955 and began to practise at the bar. He soon established himself as one of the country’s leading advocates and was often instructed in proceedings involving the Kenyan government. In 1962 he was the first non-European advocate to be appointed secretary of the Law Society of Kenya. Despite the prospect of a bright legal career in Nairobi, he emigrated to the UK in 1965, determined to practise at the English bar. Soon the scale of his challenge became clear. After six months of failed attempts to obtain a tenancy in chambers, he was compelled to seek alternative employment and accepted an offer to be in-house legal adviser to a national property company. He thrived, and eventually secured a tenancy at 1 Mitre Court, Middle Temple, to begin practising at the bar. Mota became a specialist in landlord and tenant disputes, and the counsel of choice for leading property companies, but his first brief, from his brother Manmohan Singh, a solicitor, was to represent a client on a drink-driving charge, which he successfully defended alongside his brother. The image of two Sikh lawyers in tailored suits and crisply starched white turbans captured the media’s imagination at the time. In 1968 Mota was appointed as a member of the Race Relations Board. He took silk in 1976 and three years later was appointed recorder; then a crown court judge in 1982. At Southwark crown court he was one of four judges nominated by the lord chancellor to try serious fraud cases. A devout Sikh, he would rise at two each morning to begin his daily prayer routine and yoga exercises. He also served as a trustee of charitable organisations including Barnado’s, the Windsor Leadership Trust and the Democracy Forum. In 2012 he was knighted for services to the legal profession and to charity. He is survived by Swaran and their three children, Pam, Satinder and Jaswinder.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"The Christmas cappelletti helping to preserve Italy's food heritage", "content": "Stefano Gajani Billi, a 55-year-old Roman with roots in the northern Italian region of Emilia-Romagna, has been eating homemade cappelletti for Christmas lunch for as long as he can remember. The “little hats” of meat-filled pasta used to be made exclusively by Gajani Billi’s grandmother, but the tradition has since been taken over by Stefano himself, along with his mother, sister, wife and their children. Every December they convene for a cappelletti-making bonanza, where proceedings are dominated by two strict rules. First, no shortcuts are tolerated. The filling requires at least five different meats, the pasta is made from scratch, and the broth in which the cappelletti will eventually be boiled has to be made from a capon, a castrated rooster. Second, once the pasta dough has been folded over the filling, only Gajani Billi’s sister, Elena – the boss of the operation since the deaths of their grandmother and then father – is allowed to close the cappelletti, all 500 of them. The final twist must come from her well-trained fingers, she says, otherwise they may fall apart. “It’s a family moment, in remembrance of my father and also my grandmother,” Gajani Billi says. “Also, it is the best thing you can eat in your life.” ‘Airbnbs for dining’ give Italian female chefs chance to shine Read more Such Christmas meals are pillars of Italy’s rich culinary tradition. While the definition of a “typical” festive lunch varies from region to region, dishes such as cappelletti have been considered staples for centuries. But that is changing. According to one Rome-based food writer, many labour-intensive Italian food traditions are dying off, especially in the south, largely because of economic factors that have led to the depopulation of villages and towns where the dishes used to be made. “When people speak about food here nostalgically, they talk about their grannies. The mom might not be able to make those dishes, or she might just buy them. And the grandkids certainly don’t know how to make them,” says Katie Parla. “It’s not that people who are under 60 don’t cook, but they definitely don’t do it as intensively as they once did.” The list of so-called endangered Italian foods – a topic on which Parla is now writing a book – is long and includes savoury dishes, sweets, and even digestifs and liquors. Some of the most labour-intensive foods are broths, such as the one used to cook cappelletti on Christmas Day. Some broths require an assortment of meats, which are boiled in different pots so the liquid is a perfect blend of flavours. Making the broth and then the bollito misto – mixed boiled meats that are served after the first dish – is a big job, Parla says, especially considering that a host would also be expected to prepare deep-fried vegetables for a Christmas antipasto. Traditionally, that antipasto would include vegetables that were prepared in the summer and then preserved. 10 of the best trattorias in Rome Read more In the southern region of Molise, Parla has visited a town called Civita, where a special shortbread biscuit is made with a pasta frolla crust and a filling of flour, breadcrumbs, spices and red wine. What makes the biscuits unique is their elaborate decoration using a crimping tool. In one town, which now has just 400 residents, the only people left who make the biscuits are one baker and her daughter. “When those women stop making those cookies, no one will be making them,” Parla says. “There they have an expression: ‘when she dies, the world dies’.” But Parla, an American who has lived in Rome for many years, does not think the situation is hopeless. Her book will tackle what may be considered a sensitive topic in households trying to preserve traditions: is it OK to cut corners? “In my opinion, it is one of the best ways of preserving a tradition,” Parla says. “Because if you trap a recipe in amber and require a huge number of steps, yes, it is beautiful if you can devote time and resource to it. But if you can’t, cutting corners means you are not eliminating it altogether, you are just evolving into another thing.” In the case of Gajani Billi’s Christmas lunch, that could mean buying the cappelletti and focusing on making the broth. Or it could mean buying pasta dough instead of making it. “We can still evoke the importance of those recipes on certain days if we preserve them in a simplified way,” Parla says. The Gajani Billi family recipe for Cappelletti in brodo (Cappelletti in broth) Ingredients: Fresh pasta dough (For 300 cappelletti, use 5 eggs and about a pound of flour) 1 To make the filling: in a pan of olive oil and rosemary, cook a turkey breast, 100g of mortadella, one pork chop, one sausage (casing removed), and guanciale (pork jowl). Blend the meats together and then mix in grated parmigiano reggiano and stracchino cheese. Also add 2-3 eggs and nutmeg. Refrigerate overnight. 2 Place a small dollop of the filling in the middle of a small circular piece of pasta dough. Fold the pasta in half and squeeze the sides of the pasta together. Bring the two edges of the pasta together and pinch them shut. Flip the cappelletto around and gently fold the sides down, so that it resembles a little hat. 3 For the broth: boil a capon. Remove the capon and then boil the cappelletti for about 20 minutes. Serve with the broth.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Two men convicted of involvement in funding Syrian extremists", "content": "Two men have been convicted of involvement in funding extremists in Syria by smuggling supplies in aid convoys, including the convoy that took the taxi driver Alan Henning to the region before he was kidnapped and murdered by Islamic State. The Old Bailey heard that convoys led by members of the British Muslim community had become unwitting vehicles for funds and supplies used in the planning of terrorist attacks. Syed Hoque, 37, from Stoke-on-Trent, was found guilty of two charges of providing £4,500 to terrorists, while his “fixer” Mashoud Miah, 28, from east London, was convicted on one count of helping Hoque get £1,500 to Syria. The first £3,000 was delivered via a Children in Need convoy in July 2013 and another £1,500 was sent via the same convoy that Henning travelled with. Two co-defendants were cleared of involvement: Mohammed Hussain and Pervez Rafiq, a prominent charity fundraiser who was a friend of Henning’s and said he had been courted by MI5 as a potential informer. The prosecutor, Annabel Darlow QC, told jurors the convoys were used as a means of moving money and other property out of the UK to Syria. “Normal routes are not much use when you look at Syria. So if you do want to get property or money out to Syria, the convoys would have provided a useful conduit,” she said. The court had heard that Hoque, a former probation officer, sent £4,500 to his nephew, Mohammed Choudhury, who was fighting with a Syrian group linked to al-Qaida. In incriminating WhatsApp exchanges, Choudhury, 26, asked for money to buy a Dragunov sniper rifle. Hoque was put in touch with Miah, a gas engineer, who travelled to and from Syria with aid convoys in 2012 and 2013. Miah was convicted of helping Hoque get money to Syria, but was cleared of a further charge over an alleged plot to create a “night team” of terrorist marksmen in Syria. He had been accused of drawing up a list of the equipment needed and delegating the job of sourcing much of it to Rafiq and Hussain. Giving evidence, Hoque admitted sending money to his nephew via Miah because he was fighting “in defence of those who cannot defend themselves”. He denied knowing his nephew was with a group linked to al-Qaida. Miah told jurors the Syrian people needed help and “had every right to be defended”. Following his arrest, Rafiq said he had travelled in a convoy with Henning, who was taken hostage and beheaded by Mohammed Emwazi in October 2014. Known as Jihadi John, Emwazi was killed by a US drone strike in November 2015. Giving evidence, Rafiq said he had not been back to Syria since December 2013 because of threats against him by Isis and other extremists over Henning’s death. He told jurors: “I was trying to save the life of a non-believer. He was not a Muslim.” The court heard that MI5 had offered Rafiq, who had raised £200,000 for charity, £30,000 to work for the secret services. Jurors were also told he had always cooperated with authorities who searched convoys on their way out and stopped him on the way back to the UK. Henning joined the Al-Fatiha Global convoy taking aid to Syrian refugees, and was kidnapped soon after he crossed the border in December 2013.

{ "title":"The Guardian view on Donald Trump: years of living dangerously", "content": "Donald Trump’s election shook the world as no other event of 2016. His presidency is still four weeks away, so it would be wrong to pass a verdict on it before there is any evidence. Yet the world can be justifiably fearful. Mr Trump’s cabinet picks, an overwhelmingly white male cohort of low tax and small government obsessives, climate change denying oilmen, and career soldiers, add to the dismay. But it is Mr Trump who matters. This week, the president-elect has revived the idea of a ban on Muslims entering the US and has given the green light to a new nuclear arms race. For Americans to choose someone with Mr Trump’s prejudices and instincts remains as outrageous now as it did on 8 November. It will not be hard to stay shocked. Never before has a candidate tried so hard to make America hate again. That’s why the Trump election was bigger than Brexit, both in itself and because of its global impact. Never before has someone endorsed by the Ku Klux Klan prepared to enter the White House. Never before, if you believe the CIA, has a foreign power intervened so audaciously in a US election. The impact on America itself is already enormous. No elected president has been greeted with more overt hostility, more protests and, perhaps most important of all, more soul searching. The biggest question for 2017 and beyond is how Mr Trump’s personality, judgment and behaviour will impact and shape America and the way it is governed. Election has not obviously changed him. He remains by turns shameless, impulsive, vain, threatening, slapdash, abusive – and much else. The personality matters; it shapes his judgment. It also matters because he appears to recognise so few boundaries between his private interests and his public responsibilities. This is one of those moments when those who report politics and analyse policy need to summon fresh rigour to their tasks. Mr Trump’s election will not mean politics as usual. His victory, the election of an authoritarian and demagogue in the world’s most important democracy, has raised fundamental questions of whether America is in some sense falling apart, its historic norms now unsustainable, perhaps to the extent that it is a failed state. Serious people are even asking how far and in what ways it is appropriate to consider Mr Trump a fascist or whether the republic itself can endure. Perceived economic outlook for US voters Perceived economic outlook for US voters To ask such questions is not to presuppose that the answer is yes. America is not a failed state. Mr Trump is not a fascist (though it is unnerving even to discuss whether he is a little bit fascist). The US remains one of the most prosperous and innovative places in the world. It is still governed according to the rule of law. It has both a well-educated and a large ageing population – each of which is a seedbed for stability, not revolution. And America is a more serious place, in the best sense, than it can seem from outside. As David Runciman has written, “its frustrations are those of a country where all this is true and yet still things are going wrong”. But the echoes of the 1930s should be taken seriously. Mr Trump says his nation is broken, corrupt and violent and he is the answer to all three problems. Race remains an often virulent obsession among his supporters. He charged during the campaign that Hillary Clinton “meets in secret with international banks to plot the destruction of US sovereignty in order to enrich these global financial powers, her special interest friends and her donors,” language drenched in classic antisemitism – as he must surely know. This triggers the question of whether those who voted for him really believed him. What they believed, perhaps, was that he would shake things up in ways that might be good for them and that no other candidate would do. To reach a verdict on Mr Trump means keeping several once unthinkable questions in mind. One of these is whether Americans truly believe that the US is a place whose institutions no longer provide stable government. Another is whether these institutions have forfeited consent so badly that the people want them overthrown and replaced. A third is whether they genuinely expect Mr Trump is going to do that. Another America America is certainly not working. Its failings have generated destabilising fears (see graph above). These have in turn produced Mr Trump. He was not a normal candidate. The election was not a normal election. Mr Trump will not be a normal president. It remains to be seen what he does in office. But it is neither honest nor true to pretend that this is the same America as in earlier eras. This is another America, and it has to be judged as such. Yet rigour also means acknowledging things that point in a different direction. The US stock market is currently surging in the expectation of a big fiscal stimulus in the spring. Though the president-elect’s favourability ratings remain negative – and are far inferior to Barack Obama’s increasingly positive figures – they are clearly narrowing. And a Pew poll this week showed that fewer Democrats now feel angry about the result of the election than expected to, just before it happened. None of this may last. All of it may be transient. But it can’t just be ignored. Two days before the election, Mr Trump went to an old steel-making community near Pittsburgh. There he told a cheering crowd: “We are going to win the great state of Pennsylvania and we are going to win back the White House … When we win, we are bringing steel back, we are going to bring steel back to Pennsylvania, like it used to be. We are putting our steel workers and our miners back to work. We are.” Parallels with Brexit Some bits of that have come true. Mr Trump won Pennsylvania – by 44,000 votes. He won back the White House – though more than 2.8 million more people voted for Mrs Clinton. Other parts, however, were and are lies. It is not true that Mr Trump will be bringing steel back to Pennsylvania like it used to be. He can’t. It is not true that he will be putting steel workers and miners back to work. He won’t. Most Trump voters were relatively well off, not poor; most of the poorest Americans voted for Mrs Clinton. But blue-collar white workers in swing states like Pennsylvania tipped the election to Mr Trump. Just 80,000 of them in Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania made the difference. These voters were fired up that here, at last, was a candidate who took, or said he took, their lives seriously – and who might win. But that does not mean they believed his promises. The elusive truth about the Trump presidency may be that it rests on a tacit understanding on both sides: that he was telling lies, that his voters knew it; that they were going to vote for him anyway because he would rattle the system; but that they could simultaneously rely on the system to shield them from the worst effects of their reckless choice. In that respect, there may be a parallel with the UK’s Brexit vote. Two things can nevertheless be said with some confidence. The first is that, even if they do not believe him, Americans have elected their most unpredictable and dangerous president of all time. The second is that Mr Trump will fail in the end, in spite of the damage he does on the way, because he will not be able to satisfy those who swung the vote his way in November. However you look at the possibilities, the Trump presidency makes 2017 a fearful prospect for America and the world.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Don’t be fooled by these dishonest attacks on the ‘metropolitan liberal elite’", "content": "Nigel Farage would have burst a blood vessel, had he only had the chance to listen in. What could be more metropolitan liberal elite than last week’s Guardian Christmas telethon, as readers called in to journalists to make a donation for child refugees? Just imagine it, all those Islington luvvies and bleeding hearts, ringing in from one part of London N1 to another, the Bollinger chilling nicely in the fridge, as they salved their well-paid consciences and congratulated themselves on being leftier than thou. How utterly Guardianista. We’re marching towards a mad Brexit. Someone must speak for the 48% | Jonathan Freedland Read more Except it was nothing like that. The calls came from all over the country, with perhaps an over-representation from the north of England. In my two and a half hours on the phones, I heard from Barrow-in-Furness, Hull, Lancaster, Leeds, Swansea and a string of small towns and villages from Devon to Cumbria. Colleagues reported the same pattern. True, I took a call from my own small part of north London – but it was the only one. However else you’d want to describe this group of people, metropolitan they weren’t. Nor were they the elite. Pensioners called to give the fiver or tenner they worked out they could spare, or, as Polly Toynbee has recounted, their entire winter fuel allowance. Gary Younge took a call from an unemployed Asian man, living with his parents in northern England, who gave £1.33: he chose that precise sum because he had £1.34 in his account. Meanwhile, and by coincidence, Stuart Heritage spoke again to Sam, the same teenager whose call he took last year. Sam isn’t old enough to have a credit card, but each year he has raised money at his school for the Guardian appeal. Not many of these people fit the Guardianista stereotype. I wonder what Farage and his friends would make of the lifelong reader who described the recent funeral of a 94-year-old friend: a retired major and veteran of the second world war whose devotion to the Guardian was so great that a copy of the paper was placed on top of his coffin. And yet, because of their sympathy for refugees and their presumed support for British membership of the EU – with 91% in favour, Guardian readers were the country’s most solidly pro-remain demographic, more reliably anti-Brexit than Green party voters, the young, university graduates and Scots – these people would be casually, and falsely, dismissed by the likes of Farage as the metropolitan liberal elite. Indeed, in a year brimming with dishonesties, this phrase represents one of the great myths of 2016. In August, serving as warm-up man at a Mississippi rally for Donald Trump, the then Ukip leader hailed the Brexit result as a victory for what he called the “little people, the real people ... the ordinary, decent people”. The implication was that those who had voted remain were unreal and indecent, that they were the big people, the representatives of the mighty and powerful. Theresa May played the same trick in her party conference speech in the autumn, casting the opponents of Brexit (forgetting, of course, that during the referendum campaign she was one) as members of an exclusive, global club, denizens of Davos comfortable in the first-class lounge and utterly devoid of national allegiance – people who were, in her memorable phrase, citizens of the world and therefore citizens of nowhere. As I wrote then, she sought to rebrand the 48% as the 1%. But it’s an absurd lie. Of course, more Britons voted to leave the EU than to stay, but nearly half of those voting chose remain. That is not a tiny metropolitan elite. In the US, 2.9 million more people chose Hillary Clinton than chose Donald Trump. That too is not an elite. In most democratic systems, such a margin would have been hailed as a victory and a mandate; only under the arcane rules of the electoral college could such a result have brought defeat. So enough of this fraudulent talk of elites, metropolitan or otherwise. But what of that middle word, the meat in this rhetorical sandwich? What of “liberal”? After this year, especially, I think the word should be worn with pride. If liberal means wanting to help children fleeing a dictator’s barrel-bombs, then call me a liberal. If liberal means believing that the peoples of a continent that for centuries was torn apart by war and bloodshed have found a new, peaceful mechanism for resolving their differences, and that Britain should play its part in that, then call me a liberal. If liberal means holding true to the values of the Enlightenment, including a belief in facts and evidence and reason, then call me a liberal. And if liberal means cherishing the norms and institutions that protect and sustain democracy, from a free press to an independent judiciary, then call me a liberal. For those values are under assault just now, in a way few of us ever imagined. So when it comes to “liberal”, we have nothing to apologise for. Sure, the remainers’ most public faces could fairly be described as both “metropolitan” and “elite” – columnists for London-based newspapers among them. But the same is self-evidently true of the other side, too. Michael Gove and Boris Johnson are not exactly members of the lumpen proletariat, are they? There is no definition of elite or metropolitan that does not include those two. The US has elected its most dangerous leader. We all have plenty to fear | Jonathan Freedland Read more And the same is true of that other dread phrase of 2016, “the bubble”. As if the only people who live in a bubble are liberal, anti-Trump, anti-Brexit types, while their opponents are rooted in the earthiness of the real world. What garbage. Stockbroker Farage paid homage to billionaire Trump in the latter’s gold elevator; that’s the same Farage who confessed his relief that vacating the Ukip leadership meant he no longer had to deal with “low-grade people” and who said his £85,000 MEP’s salary, excluding abundant expenses, meant he was “poor”. Those who truly live in a bubble are those who cannot begin to imagine the lives of – still less empathise with – those outside their own first-world realm of safety, comfort and prosperity. When Tory MP and Dorset landowner Richard Drax objects to an overseas aid budget of 0.7% of national income, insisting “charity begins at home” – as if 99.3% of our “charity” isn’t already being spent at home – then it’s he who’s living in a bubble. But in this season of goodwill, let’s not play their game – competing over which side is less detached, less metropolitan or less elite. Instead, let’s think of those people who were so moved by the plight of their fellow human beings they gave what they had, even when they could barely spare it. Call them names if you like, but they are the very best of us.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Camber Sands deaths blamed on victims' 'culture' by council", "content": "The council that did not provide lifeguards at Camber Sands beach has blamed drownings over the summer on the limitations of “non-swimming persons of a certain culture”, according to an internal document seen by the Guardian. Seven men – one of Asian heritage, one Brazilian teenager, and five of Tamil origin – died at the popular seaside resort of Camber Sands in East Sussex in July and August. All the men were described by family members as capable swimmers. There is no lifeguard in attendance on the beach, where up to 25,000 people visit on hot days. But an incident log filed by a Rother district council official after the first two men drowned warned that the fact that the beach attracts “predominantly non-British visitors has been an increasing issue”. Despite the high number of fatalities during the summer the council said it had not yet made a decision about whether to introduce a lifeguard service on Camber Sands next year. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Clockwise from top left: Kobikanthan Saththiyanathan, Nitharsan Ravi, Gurushanth Srithavarajah, Kenugen Saththiyanathan, and Inthushan Sriskantharasa. Photograph: Facebook A senior lifeguard manager from the Royal National Lifeboat Institution was on the beach carrying out a safety assessment on 24 August, the day the five men of Tamil origin drowned, the Guardian understands. In 2013 the RNLI carried out a risk assessment recommending that a lifeguard service be introduced at the beach, a recommendation that was not taken up by Rother district council. Relatives of the five men who drowned on 24 August expressed shock and anger about the comments referring to nationality and culture and about the failure to provide a lifeguard service during the busy summer months. “I don’t understand why these things are said about nationality and culture,” said Uthayamalar Srithavarajah, whose 27-year-old son Gurushanth was among the dead. “The job of the council is to protect people, not to judge them on appearance.” Others said the revelations had compounded their grief. They also hit out at inaccurate initial reports in some sections of the media that variously described the men as illegal immigrants trying to swim to the shore, non-swimmers and people unable to speak English. “All this incorrect information about our sons has made our heartbreak so much worse,” said Jegaleela Saththiyanathan, 52, who lost two sons, Kenugen, 18, known as Ken, and Kobikanthan, 22, known as Kobi, in the tragedy. According to their relatives all seven of the men who drowned could swim, although the council official who wrote the incident log said he was informed when Dupar got into trouble in the sea that he could not swim. Of the five young Tamil men, all of whom had been resident in the UK for several years, three were at university, a fourth was in full-time education and a fifth had secured a university place. The others who died with Srithavarajah and the Saththiyanathan brothers were their friends Nitharsan Ravi, 22, and Inthushan Sriskantharasa, 23. They all lived in London. The Brazilian teenager Gustavo Cruz and Mohit Dupar, a man of Asian heritage from London, died on 24 July. Dupar lost his life trying to save Cruz. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Grieving relatives of the men of Tamil origin who drowned. Photograph: Sarah Lee for the Guardian The RNLI has been in dialogue with Rother district council since 2003 about safety issues, the Guardian understands. A spokesman confirmed that one of the RNLI’s senior lifeguard managers was on the beach on the day the five men drowned. “He was there for an informal visit to view the beach during the summer period as part of our ongoing relationship with the council,” he said. Mayura Ravi, 17, sister of Nitharsan Ravi, condemned the stereotyped views expressed in the internal council document and inaccurate media reports. “The boys were studying. All five could swim really well and had no problems with speaking English so these things that have been said are just rubbish,” she said. She added that all had been legally resident in the UK for a number of years and that some of them loved the beach and the sea so much that they went there five or six times a year. Some of the boys had been brought up close to the seashore in Sri Lanka and were used to swimming in the sea. Jegaleela Saththiyanathan said her two sons and the other young men knew each other well, as did their families. She described them as upstanding individuals who did not drink or smoke or indulge in antisocial behaviour and, as well as loving sports like cricket, did voluntary work to help their community. The incident log for 24 July , the day the first two bathers drowned, written by a council official, states: “We are again faced with incidents of non-swimming persons of a certain culture that enter the water in great numbers with deadly results. The combination of a beach as shallow as Camber attracting predominantly non-British visitors has been an increasing issue over the last 10 years and the risks that these people create upon their lack of ability in being ‘tempted in’ to such a shallow bay are becoming unsustainable and unfair for us to deal with or carry the burden of responding to.” The report goes on: “For a non-swimmer to jump into the deep end of Rye swimming bath would be foolish but we are faced with thousands entering an ocean and responding to their actions and inevitable consequences. An incoming tide, sand bars and breeze is a lethal combination for such people of little swimming ability and we are being left with the trauma of responding to the consequences.” Facebook Twitter Pinterest Beachgoers at Camber Sands. Photograph: Jack Taylor/Getty Images At a pre-inquest review into all seven deaths last month the council official who wrote the incident log gave evidence and talked about the changing demographic of people using the beach and the associated language and educational issues. “This is something we have to adapt to,” he told East Sussex’s senior coroner, Alan Craze. “We are constantly dealing with people’s naiveties and lack of education.” Gurushanth Srithavarajah’s mother, Uthayamalar, condemned the lack of lifeguards on the beach that day. “No one from our community will ever go to Camber Sands again,” she said. “But we want to ensure that other members of the public are protected for the future. We want to see lifeguards in place on that beach. Had there been lifeguards there on the day we lost our sons they may still be alive today.” She added: “No other person should ever have to go through the kind of loss and pain we are experiencing. We should be the last. Irrespective of skin colour, whether people are white, black or Asian, we don’t want to see anyone suffer the way we are suffering.” Facebook Twitter Pinterest Mourners at the funeral of the five friends who died at Camber Sands in August. Photograph: Jonathan Brady/PA At the inquest hearing, Patrick Roche, representing the Tamil families, said that as well as the deaths there had been seven “near-deaths” at Camber. The coroner is investigating what public safety measures could be introduced at Camber Sands. He said: “The provision of safety for the vast numbers of people that go to Camber is now an extremely important matter, and I owe it to the community as a whole to investigate as far as I conceivably can do.” The home secretary, Amber Rudd, whose Hastings and Rye constituency includes Camber Sands, said she was “deeply saddened” by the deaths and had visited the beach along with councillors and an RNLI official to establish ways to improve swimmers’ safety. “I am taking a strong interest on this issue of beach safety, and I wait to hear the outcome of the inquest next year,” she said in a statement. In a statement the RNLI said: “The RNLI have been in talks with RDC [Rother district council] since 2003 and has carried out several risk assessments over the years. The most recent assessment was carried out in 2013. As part of this we suggested the RDC consider a series of potential control measures to manage specific hazards. One of these recommendations included considering the option of introducing a seasonal lifeguard service and that a service level assessment should be carried out. At that time, this suggestion was not taken further but the charity has remained in conversation with the council and, following the incident in August in which five young men drowned, the RNLI was able to set up and provide a temporary lifeguard service to cover until 4 September.” A Rother district council spokesman said: “We continue to look closely at all options for Camber beach and are in discussion with relevant partners. Money has been earmarked in the 2017-18 budget to ensure funding is available to implement the agreed option.” The spokesman said it would be inappropriate to comment on other matters before the inquest, which is due to resume early next year.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Lebanon protests urged after man picked as first women's affairs minister", "content": "Feminist groups in Lebanon have called for protests over the appointment of a man as the country’s first-ever women’s affairs minister. The choice of Jean Ogasapian to run the ministry has sparked widespread disbelief and mockery over what many perceived as an insult to Lebanon’s active women’s rights movement. Nasri Atallah, a Lebanese writer, described it as “the ultimate act of mansplaining”. The Lebanese government convened this week for the first time since Saad Hariri was sworn in as prime minister. It capped two and a half years of a political vacuum during which the country had no president. Amid the political jockeying for seats in the cabinet, which are divided by sectarian loyalties and allegiance to the country’s many warlords-turned-politicians rather than any measure of competence, Ogasapian’s appointment drew strong derision. KAFA, a prominent women’s rights organisation, called for protests under the slogan, “No women, no legitimacy”. “The government that has been announced is a clear indictment to all the politicians who took part in creating it,” the organisation said in a statement. “It is an insult to all women.” Lebanon faces many challenges in advancing women’s rights in a nation that has a thin veneer of westernisation but remains deeply patriarchal. Domestic violence is pervasive in the country, and Lebanese women cannot pass on their citizenship to their children if they marry foreigners. Only this month, the parliament began the process of repealing an article in the penal code that allowed the halting of a rape prosecution if the perpetrator married his victim. Commentators on social media satirised the appointment of a man in the women’s affairs ministry – a state ministry that will probably have little power to advance women’s rights. One common joke showed Rosie the Riveter, who symbolised American women working in shipyards in a second world war poster campaign, with Ogasapian’s face transposed over Rosie’s. Rima Njeim, a popular radio host, joked that a male women’s affairs minister could extend maternity leave until a newborn starts school or make all women retake their driving licence tests. Others pointed out that few of the other ministers were suited to their jobs. The tourism minister, for example, has a degree in physics; the minister of culture is a vascular surgeon; the agriculture minister is a lawyer; and the minister of public health holds a degree in engineering. Lebanon’s new government, led by the son of the assassinated former prime minister Rafik Hariri, faces numerous problems, including decaying infrastructure and power cuts to recurring crises in rubbish collection, caring for a refugee population from Syria that numbers more than a million, and containing the fallout from the war in which Hezbollah, the most powerful military organisation in the country, is fighting for the regime of Bashar al-Assad.",diasaster:0},

{ "title":"Group allegedly behind DNC hack targeted Ukraine, report finds", "content": "A new report suggests the same hacking group believed to have hacked the Democrats during the recent presidential election also targeted Ukrainian artillery units over a two-year period, that if confirmed would add to suspicions they are Russian state operatives. The report, issued by cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike, said a malware implant on Android devices was used to track the movements of Ukrainian artillery units and then target them. The hackers were able to access communications and geolocations of the devices, which meant the artillery could then be fired on and destroyed. The report will further fuel concerns that Russia is deploying hacking and cyber-attacks as a tool of both war and foreign policy. The hack “extends Russian cyber-capabilities to the frontlines of the battlefield”, the report said. Cozy Bear and Fancy Bear: did Russians hack Democratic party and if so, why? Read more Russia gave military and logistical backing to separatists fighting against Ukrainian forces in east Ukraine, in a war that broke out in spring 2014. The application was designed for use with the D-30 122mm towed howitzer, a Soviet-made artillery weapon still in use today. The app reduced firing times from minutes to seconds, according to the Ukrainian officer who designed it. However, it appears that the Android app was infected with a Trojan. CrowdStrike said open-source research suggested that during the two years of conflict, Ukrainian artillery forces lost 50% of all weaponry but over 80% of their D-30 howitzers. The higher than average loss suggests data gained from the hack was then used to target the artillery. Research has shown that Russia shelled Ukraine from inside its own territory, as well as sending weapons and troops over the border. Officially, Russia denied any major role in the conflict. The malware was a version of the type used in the hack of the Democratic National Committee, CrowdStrike believes, making it highly likely that Fancy Bear, a hacking group believed to be based in Russia, was the culprit. “The source code to this malware has not been observed in the public domain and appears to have been developed uniquely by Fancy Bear,” CrowdStrike said. US intelligence officials believe Fancy Bear works on behalf of the GRU, the intelligence agency of Russia’s army. Before the attack on the DNC, the same group is believed to have interfered on behalf of Russian interests in Georgia (pdf) and other countries bordering Russia. “This cannot be a hands-off group or a bunch of criminals. They need to be in close communication with the Russian military,” CrowdStrike co-founder Dmitri Alperovitch told Reuters. US officials believe Fancy Bear and other Russian hackers intervened in the election, with the aim of giving an advantage to Donald Trump. Both Fancy Bear and another supposedly Russian hacking group named Cozy Bear had hacked the DNC servers, according to analysts, without knowing about each other. Vladimir Putin has dismissed the allegations as “hysteria”, while Trump himself has also rubbished the US intelligence assessment in recent days. But the new allegations, if proved, would make it harder to distance the activities of the hackers from the Russian state. “CrowdStrike have been pretty reliable in the past, and their reports about the bears were independently verified,” said Andrei Soldatov, co-author of the Red Web, a recent book about the Russian internet. He said: “This doesn’t mean Fancy Bear is GRU: it could be, but not necessarily. But I think this new information means Fancy Bear is more incorporated into the Russian state than I might have thought before, and works with the military.” However, Yaroslav Sherstyuk, the Ukrainian military officer who developed the app, wrote on Facebook that the report was “total nonsense”. He said he was personally in control of downloads of the app and that they were not compromised, suggesting the report itself might be a way to spread panic among Ukrainian military units.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Registry used to track Arabs and Muslims dismantled by Obama administration", "content": "The Obama administration is dismantling a discriminatory surveillance system that was used after 9/11 to keep tabs on Arabs and Muslims across the US, in a move that will make it more difficult for president-elect Donald Trump to achieve his goal of introducing a Muslim registry. Muslims to march on White House in bid to dismantle discriminatory registry Read more Thursday’s announcement by the Department of Homeland Security that it is tearing down the remnants of the National Security Entry-Exit Registration System (Nseers) marks the most audacious attempt yet by Barack Obama to place roadblocks in the way of his successor’s declared intentions. A key element of Trump’s bid for the White House was his threat to prevent non-citizen Muslims from entering the US and to keep them under surveillance once inside the country. The Nseers program was one of the most contentious – and widely hated – elements of the Bush administration’s anti-terror policies in the wake of 9/11. More than 80,000 people from 25 listed countries, 24 of which had majority Muslim or Arab populations, were forced onto the scheme in which they were required to provide fingerprints and a photograph and periodically present themselves for in-person interviews with DHS officers. About 14,000 of those individuals were placed into deportation proceedings. Yet not a single individual was found to have any links to terrorist or violent activities. Mohammad Jafar Alam, a member of South Asian social justice group Desis Rising Up and Moving (Drum) that was at the forefront of the campaign to dismantle Nseers, was one of those who endured Nseers surveillance. He said he knew from personal experience what it did to individuals and their families. “The extreme mental, emotional distress, the financial problems, the pressures on a family and the isolation that happens is a punishment not just for one person, but everyone involved.” Joanne Lin, legislative counsel with the ACLU, which was also at the front line of opposition to Nseers, said it was a “completely failed counterterrorism program. Out of 80,000 men who registered for it, there was not a single terrorism conviction, yet it alienated Muslim and South Asian communities across the country. So we are very pleased that the Obama administration has moved to end it.” Obama has come under intense lobbying in recent days from human rights and Muslim American groups to do something about the Nseers system. Though the current president has generally acted cautiously in avoiding any impression that he wants to foil Trump’s policies, his move to unpick the surveillance scheme is a sign of how opposed he is to his successor’s threats to put Muslims under the governmental spotlight. Nseers was allowed to fall into abeyance in 2011 after DHS and FBI officials concluded that it was discriminatory and ineffective. But the framework for the registry remained in place until this week, meaning that it could easily and quickly have been revived by the incoming Trump administration simply by putting majority Muslim countries back onto the list. Now with the posting of the DHS order dismantling the final remnants of the scheme, it will be much more difficult for Trump to implement his avowed intent to place Muslims under renewed surveillance. The final order tearing down Nseers will be posted on Friday, with immediate effect. Facebook Twitter Pinterest During the primaries, Donald Trump called for a complete ban on Muslims entering the US. Professor Shoba Sivaprasad Wadhia, director of the Center for Immigrants’ Rights clinic at the Pennsylvania State University, said that the rescinding of the Nseers structure would put a break on Trump’s plans. “At the very least it is going to take time. At most it will take a whole lot of time, as it will force the Trump administration to introduce a rule change that could be open to public comment and legal challenge.” Wadhia added: “This is the best Christmas present I could have asked for.” Trump and a Muslim registry: does he want one – and is it even possible? Read more The contentious call for a ban on all Muslims entering the US became a cornerstone of Trump’s presidential campaign. He later changed that posture to proposing the introduction of “extreme vetting” of newcomers with a focus on a number of identified countries deemed a terrorism threat. Kris Kobach, one of the original architects of Nseers who has been advising the Trump transition team on immigration and anti-terrorism, proposed last month as his no 1 priority for homeland security that he would “update and reintroduce” the surveillance program. Gregory Chen, director of advocacy at the American Immigration Lawyers Association, said that Nseers had “upended the lives of tens of thousands of businessmen, scientists, families and other individuals lawfully present in our country. The Obama administration has publicly acknowledged that the program is obsolete and unnecessary as a counterterrorism tool.” • This article was amended on 29 December 2016 to correct a quote from Joanne Lin.

Spokeswoman Frauke Köhler said that fingerprints of the Tunisian, who turned 24 on Thursday, had been discovered on the outside of the Polish-registered articulated truck, as well as the driver’s door and the vertical support beam in the vehicle’s window area. Speaking at a joint press conference with the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, the interior minister, Thomas de Maizière, said that the fingerprints and other evidence made it “highly probable” that the Tunisian suspect was the perpetrator of Monday’s terror attack. Sadness and defiance mark the reopening of Breitscheidplatz market Read more Merkel told the press conference that she hoped the suspect would be caught “soon” and that she had been heartened by the public reaction to the tragedy: “In the last few days I have been very proud of how level-headed the reaction of the majority of people to this situation has been.” The findings came as Amri’s brother said he could not believe that his sibling would have carried out the atrocity. “There was no sign he had been radicalised. I’m sure he can’t have done this, that’s not why he emigrated. May God reveal the truth,” Abdelkader Amri told a reporter from Agence France-Presse outside his home in the town of Oueslatia, about 30 miles (50km) from Kairouan in eastern Tunisia. “If my brother is behind the attack, I say to him: ‘You dishonour us,’” Abdelkader Amri said. The suspect, meanwhile, remained on the run, with German police left empty-handed after a day of raids around the country. In Berlin’s Moabit district, a commando unit deployed flash grenades to storm a Salafist meeting point that had been frequented by Amri but left without making arrests.

With a man feared armed and dangerous still on the loose three days after Monday’s deadly attack, German politicians rounded on the country’s security services, with one politician accusing intelligence agencies of “catastrophic mistakes”. “What we are dealing with is a failure of government that cannot be tolerated,” the opposition politician Christian Lindner of the Free Democrats told the German news agency DPA. A deputy chairman of Merkel’s Christian Democratic party accused intelligence agencies of incompetence, saying Wednesday’s reports on security failures had left him “shocked”. Berlin Christmas market attack: a graphical guide to what we know so far Read more Having first registered in the North-Rhine Westphalia region upon entering Germany in July 2015, the suspect had been identified as a security risk and put under close surveillance, with investigators even aware of his willingness to carry out a suicide attack. But a surveillance operation was stopped in September and Amri dropped off intelligence agencies’ radar in November, possibly due to a mix-up between regional authorities. Criticising the work of intelligence agencies in North-Rhine Westphalia, the CDU deputy chair, Armin Laschet, said: “So the attitude seems to be: ‘He’s gone to Berlin, so the case is closed for us here. Now it’s Berlin’s turn.’” Laschet called for better coordination between security agencies across Germany’s federal state system. The delay in identifying Amri as the driver of the truck also continued to raise eyebrows, after police had wrongly arrested a Pakistani asylum seeker in the direct aftermath of the attack.

But police on Thursday insisted that they had not obtained the wallet with the documents that identified Amri until Tuesday afternoon, stating that the truck had had to be moved from the site of the accident and searched by sniffer dogs before it could be properly scrutinised by police officers. Anis Amri had fled Tunisia after the 2011 revolution, registering on the island of Lampedusa in February that year. According to Italian media, he started to show signs of aggressive behaviour while attending a centre for minors in Catania, reportedly having tried to set his school on fire. In October 2011, Amri was charged for robbery, arson and personal threats and sentenced to four years in jail. He reportedly spent time in prisons in Catania and then Palermo. Does the Berlin attack make the case for increased surveillance? Read more During his time in prison his “aggressive behaviour’’ was noted by guards, an official told the Guardian. After his release, Amri was sent to an immigration centre at Caltanissetta, from where he was due to be deported back to Tunisia. Since authorities in Tunisia refused to recognise Amri as a Tunisian citizen, however, the deportation did not take place. In the summer of 2015 Anis left Italy for Germany, first registering in the town of Emmerich am Rhine. In April 2016 Amri applied for asylum at a refugee shelter in Kleve, also in North Rhine-Westphalia, but his application was rejected only weeks later. Amri had pretended to be an Egyptian national, but German officials had noticed that he had already registered elsewhere under different names. He was therefore due to be deported back to Tunisia. But as in Italy, authorities in his home country did not recognise him as one of their citizens. On 30 July, Amri was caught in a routine check of a coach in Friedrichshafen and moved to a prison in Ravensburg after police noticed that he was due to be deported and carrying fake Italian ID documents. Two days later the Tunisian was released again, most likely because of the missing documents from Tunisia. Additional reporting by Lorenzo Tondo",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Thousands of refugees left in cold, as UN and EU accused of mismanagement", "content": "The UN refugee agency and the EU’s aid department have been accused by other aid groups of mismanaging a multimillion-pound fund earmarked for the most vulnerable refugees in Europe, leaving thousands sleeping in freezing conditions in Greece. The Greek government, which has ultimate jurisdiction over camp activities, has also been criticised for failing to use nearly €90m (£75m) of separate EU funding to adequately improve conditions at the camps before the onset of winter. No single actor has overall control of all funding and management decisions in the camps, allowing most parties to distance themselves from blame. Please help us help #childrefugees survive the winter - Guardian/Observer 2016 Appeal Read more The EU aid department, known as Echo, has given UNHCR more than €14m since April to help prepare roughly 50 refugee camps for the winter in Greece, where an estimated 50,000 mainly Syrian refugees have been stranded since the adoption of new European migration policies in March. A further €24m has been given to UNHCR for other projects. Both organisations stand accused by other aid groups of squandering this money, after failing to properly “winterise” or evacuate dozens of camps before snow fell in Greece earlier in December. In addition to providing warmer bedding and clothes, UNHCR was expected to use this money to move people from tents to heated containers or formal housing; heat warehouses where other refugees are living; provide a consistent supply of hot water; and install insulated flooring for anyone still left in tents. Months after the funds were dispersed, roughly half of those living in camps had yet to be transferred to formal housing by the onset of winter. Of the 45 camps that were still active at the start of the month, the Guardian visited or was made aware of at least 15 camps that had yet to be properly adapted by the time snow fell in northern Greece at the start of December. UNHCR admitted it was itself aware of only eight camps where all the residents have been moved out of tents and into prefabricated containers. In a recent UNHCR video, promoted by Echo, the two institutions hailed the success of their winterisation work. In early December, the EU also said that Greece was safe enough to return refugees there from other European countries. But refugees and independent aid workers say Echo and UNHCR had initially ignored the gravity of the situation. The head of Medécins Sans Frontières in Greece, Loic Jaeger, described the situation as a failure. 'Prisoners of Europe': the everyday humiliation of refugees stuck in Greece Read more “We are outraged about the positive communications [from UNHCR and the EU] that are completely disconnected with reality,” said Jaeger, speaking before UNHCR began to admit flaws in the process on 9 December. Jaeger said: “Our feeling is that there is a willingness now, led by the fact that there is a massive amount of money [allocated for winterisation], to try to present the situation as if it is OK. But it is not. On the islands we are still not even starting to winterise. In some places it’s working quite well, but in northern Greece you still have people sleeping in tents in the snow.” Jaeger added: “What is being done with all this money? Who is checking? Where is the report from the EU or UNHCR assessing what is still to be done? Where is the transparency? There is a discrepancy between what is claimed and what is the reality.” At three camps visited by the Guardian, three refugees with newborn babies condemned the freezing conditions their children had been left in. “It’s too cold here for a baby,” said Sonya, a 17-year-old Syrian Kurd, whose first child was born prematurely in the week that snow fell in Thessaloniki. Asked by the Guardian, both UNHCR and the EU released a breakdown of their spending on winterisation and other areas. More than 21,000 people have been placed in formal housing, the data shows – but an estimated 20,000 remained in camps in early December. Officials from both institutions partly blamed the cash-strapped Greek government for the failure to properly accommodate the refugees, who were left stranded on Greek territory by other EU countries in March. Refugee camp map In response, Greece’s migration ministry said that while it was ultimately responsible for the camps, it was hamstrung by a lack of independent funding. EU funds are dispersed to the Greek army and other Greek institutions – and to UNHCR and 13 other large international agencies and charities – rather than the migration ministry itself. “We don’t have funds on our own,” said Nicholas Connolly Rangos, the ministry’s regional coordinator for northern Greece. “All we can do is push and push our Echo partners, UNHCR, and the big NGOs … [who] cannot overcome their internal processes to provide assistance sooner.” A spokesman for Echo highlighted how other wings of the EU have provided nearly €800m directly to Greek institutions, to help them respond to the refugee crisis. A breakdown of that spending shows that the EU has sent nearly €90m to Greek institutions to improve the camps – though none of it was specifically allocated for winterisation, unlike the €14m allocated to UNHCR. The ongoing blame game highlights the level of disorganisation across the entire response to the Greek refugee crisis. No single actor has overall control of all funding and management decisions in the camps. Throughout months of research in several sites across Greece, the Guardian has found that the EU, UNHCR, major NGOs, the Greek government and the Greek army all use the the absence of a clear chain of command to absolve themselves of responsibility for the dysfunctional system. Secret aid worker: Greece has exposed the aid community's failures Read more Additionally, the Guardian has found that Echo dispersed nearly €190m to a group of major UN agencies and charities working in Greek refugee camps – without ensuring that the the aid would be spread equally across the camps. Only a few camps have designated funding for the full range of services offered by the charities. Guardian analysis of data provided by the EU shows that 19 camps receive no designated EU funding for water-related infrastructure such as toilets and showers; another 19 have no designated funding for healthcare; 10 receive no designated funding for psycho-social care; 26 receive no designated funding for child protection or child-friendly spaces; 25 receive no funding for female friendly spaces. Asked to comment on this analysis, the EU did not dispute the figures. Finally, grassroots groups claim that the recipients of this EU funding are often slow to spend it, forcing smaller volunteer-led groups to use their weaker resources to fill in the gaps. The Guardian has found evidence that in at least nine camps, grassroots groups have spent hundreds of thousands of euros on projects that should have been paid for with the funding supplied by the EU to the major charities. In the most telling example, a grassroots US-based charity claims it was left to pay more than €100,000 to winterise the camp of Oinofyta, in southern Greece. Lisa Campbell, the co-founder of Do Your Part, said: “Since no one else had any money, Do Your Part, a very small American organisation, is spending €115,000 so that refugees don’t have to stay outside during winter.” In northern Greece, the small charity RefuAid wants to set up long-term integration projects – but says it has been forced to spend most of its budget on short-term projects because larger NGOs have failed to use the EU funding that had been designated for that purpose. Help Refugees: 'We will never abandon them' Read more “Our organisation is about preparing for the long term, but instead we’re spending all our money on the short term because we’re having to step in for the larger NGOs,” said Anna Jones, RefuAid’s co-founder. “At least half our funding has been spent on short-term projects – around £20,000-25,000 – because larger organisations are not stepping up.” The EU denies that its money is being badly spent, and says it is doing all it can to monitor where its money goes. A spokesman said its partners were subject to four layers of control and that its funding was “the most thoroughly monitored and controlled of all international aid donated for the refugee crisis in Greece”. In response to questions about the winterisation process, UNHCR said: “As we are out there on the refugee sites every day, we understand and share your analysis that there are gaps. Just the other day, we brought 11 new-born babies out of tents into hotels because their tents had not been replaced by other accommodation. The [Greek migration] ministry had asked us to trouble-shoot and step in on that one. And we are seeing the consequences of the delays in other areas. Humanitarian actors, including us and the volunteers, are in facing serious challenges and trying to close the gaps.”",diasaster:0},

{ "title":"Hope Not Hate founder attacks Nigel Farage over Brendan Cox remarks", "content": "The founder of the campaign group Hope Not Hate has described Nigel Farage as “disgustingly offensive” for saying the widower of the murdered MP Jo Cox was tainted by extremism because he supported the organisation. Writing for the Guardian, Nick Lowles likens the Ukip politician to Donald Trump, saying both seek to “vilify, abuse and bully their opponents into silence”, in part through abuse from their supporters on social media. Nigel Farage has attacked us at Hope not Hate. It’s time to draw a line in the sand | Nick Lowles Read more Farage dislikes Hope Not Hate, Lowles argues, because his organisation, which campaigns against political militancy, has “shone the spotlight” on Ukip, and campaigned to stop Farage being elected to the Thanet parliamentary seat at the 2015 election. Lowles’s comments follow a row on Tuesday, which began when Brendan Cox, whose wife was murdered in June by the neo-Nazi terrorist Thomas Mair, replied to a tweet by Farage blaming the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, for the Berlin truck attack. This was “a slippery slope”, Cox warned. Speaking soon afterwards to LBC radio, Farage accused Cox of links to extremism via Hope Not Hate, one of three charities supported by a foundation set up in the name of Jo Cox. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Farage accuses Brendan Cox of backing extremist groups Farage said: “Well, of course, he would know more about extremists than me, Mr Cox. He backs organisations like Hope Not Hate, who masquerade as being lovely and peaceful, but actually pursue violent and undemocratic means.” This prompted a barrage of criticism from Labour MPs, and a demand from Hope Not Hate that Farage withdraw his comments or face legal action. A crowdfunding campaign to pay for the case has received a huge response, the group said on Wednesday. In his article, Lowles says Farage has “lashed out in the most unbelievable way” by trying to say Brendan Cox was associated with extremism. “Even by his standards, Farage’s comments were disgustingly offensive. Many were outraged, not just us,” he writes. It is, Lowles says, “a David v Goliath struggle, where the other side portrays itself as the underdog, yet in reality is backed by an online army and millionaires in the wings”. Farage and Trump form part of a resurgent populist right, Lowles argues: “That’s why it’s time to draw a line in the sand and why we have demanded a retraction and an apology from Nigel Farage. He cannot keep getting away unchallenged with his lies any longer.” Hope Not Hate is an offshoot of Searchlight, a long-established anti-fascist magazine. While the bulk of its campaigning has targeted the likes of the British National party and the anti-Islamic English Defence League, it also covers areas such as Islamist extremism. How British anti-racist group infiltrated the Ku Klux Klan Read more Farage’s animosity against the group dates back to Hope Not Hate’s decision in 2013 to monitor Ukip’s policies and extreme elements attracted to the party, although it has never classified Ukip itself as far right. Lowles says Hope Not Hate began looking into Ukip “as it began adopting a more anti-immigrant stance and specifically whipping up scare stories with claims that 29 million Bulgarians and Romanians would come to the UK”. He adds: “Events since have proved we were right to do so.” Hope Not Hate is split into two parts: a charitable arm that funds community projects and research, and a company that carries out more overtly political campaigns. The charitable trust has previously received government funding to run community work in areas where the EDL was active.

{ "title":"MPs to review Bank of England's low interest rates since crash", "content": "The Bank of England’s policy of near zero interest rates since the 2008 financial crash is to come under scrutiny by MPs in a far-reaching probe that could lead to calls for changes to the central bank’s remit, it was announced on Thursday. The influential Treasury select committee said it would also examine the damage to the Bank’s reputation from attacks on governor Mark Carney by senior politicians. The review comes after Theresa May’s comments at the Tory conference that low interest rates and the £435bn programme of purchasing government bonds, known as quantitative easing, had “bad side-effects”, sparking concerns that ministers wanted to bring the central bank back under Treasury control. May said she was concerned that “just managing” families were suffering from policies devised in Threadneedle Street that increased inequality. Bank of England leaves UK interest rates on hold at 0.25% Read more Newspaper articles and comments that followed by former ministers and pro-Brexit campaigners Michael Gove and Nigel Lawson, and the Eurosceptic former Conservative party leader William Hague, appeared to be part of a co-ordinated assault on Carney and prompted the bank governor to say last month that politicians had embarked on a “massive blame-deflection exercise”. Most economic forecasts predict that the UK’s slowing economy will force the Bank to stick with its current policies of rock-bottom rates for another year, angering powerful lobby groups of pensioners that have complained about receiving meagre returns on their savings. Andrew Tyrie, the Tory MP who chairs the committee, said he also wanted to investigate the “unintended consequences” of maintaining the bank’s base rate at 0.25% and how much it had increased the incentive for households to put extra money aside. Seven years of government bond purchases by the bank, which amount to £435bn, will also be questioned by MPs. Tyrie said the committee wanted to consider the stimulating effect on the economy of extending the bond buying programme to corporate bonds. “Interest rates are stuck near zero, the Bank of England has used increasingly unconventional forms of quantitative easing, and inflation has been below the 2% target for three years,” he said. “The efficacy of monetary policy or otherwise, its unintended consequences, and its prospects, need careful examination.” Tyrie said he was concerned about the series of attacks on the Bank and wanted to consider further safeguards to protect its independence He said: “The Treasury committee will continue to act as a safeguard on the operational independence of the Bank. The Treasury indemnity, which underpins parts of the Bank’s monetary policy, could all too easily encourage the Treasury, or politicians, to put undue pressure on the Bank.” The review is likely to dismay Carney, who has assured Tyrie and MPs on the committee on several occasions that the monetary policy committee, which he chairs, has considered all the consequences of its actions and followed the only path open to it. Some thinktanks urged Carney to raise interest rates in 2014 once the UK economy began to recover strongly from the banking crash. But a succession of shocks, including the recent Brexit vote result, have persuaded Carney and the nine-strong MPC to reject these calls and inject further funds to stimulate the economy. In August, following a panicky reaction to the Brexit vote by businesses and consumers, the Bank cut the base rate from 0.5% and added another £60bn to its quantitative easing programme. Threadneedle Street has come under fire from pensioner groups and savers who argue that it has favoured borrowers over savers by keeping interest rates low. The committee said it wants to test how much savers have found themselves pumping even greater funds into their pensions and savings plans to make up for the lost interest, possibly depressing consumer spending and business investment as a result. Deputy governor Ben Broadbent said the bank’s analysis showed that while savers had experienced lower interest rates since 2008, the value of their assets had been protected by the bank’s policies. Broadbent said a long spell of ultra-low interest rates had not caused a rise in inequality in the UK, explaining in his speech that, given most income came from wages and not assets, low rates had not encouraged a rise in income inequality. Furthermore, in the case of assets, there was little effect on inequality from loose monetary policy, he said. • This article was amended on 23 December 2016.

On Thursday, the Spanish Socialist party (PSOE) announced that staff at its Madrid headquarters had won a share of the country’s €2.3bn (£1.96bn) Christmas lottery, El Gordo (the Fat One). “Happy that many workers have got lucky with the Christmas lottery,” the party said in a tweet, adding, with a degree of understatement: “A great end to a difficult year.” The fillip, however, is likely to be short-lived as the party is still reeling from its worst elections results in four decades and remains without a leader following the removal of Pedro Sánchez two months ago. The 2016 El Gordo comes at the end of the most tumultuous year in Spanish politics since the transition to democracy following Francisco Franco’s death in 1975. Two inconclusive general elections left the country without a government for 10 months until the end of October, when Mariano Rajoy, leader of the conservative People’s party, managed to form a minority government thanks to an abstention by a deeply divided PSOE. The Christmas lottery has once again proved a welcome distraction from political skirmishes and Spain’s slow recovery from the economic crisis of 2008. Madrid proved the big winner of this year’s El Gordo as all the tickets bearing the first prize number of 66513 were sold in the capital’s Acacias neighbourhood. The winning number was sold at a lottery shop that was taken over by its new owner just four months ago. The outlet is on Paseo de la Esperanza – or Hope Street. The five lucky digits appeared on 1,650 tickets, yielding each holder of a décimo – or 10th share – €400,000. El Gordo, which dates back to 1812, offers more total prize money than any other lottery.

The City of London Corporation, the local authority that covers much of the financial district, urged Theresa May to arrange transition arrangements “as soon as possible”. Mark Boleat, policy chair of the City of London Corporation, said: “Brexit has brought with it a significant amount of uncertainty for businesses in the services sector. “Important strategic business decisions are being delayed and much needed investment postponed or withdrawn altogether. Firms’ nervousness can only be allayed if they know how they can continue running their business. A transitional arrangement should be agreed as soon as possible.” There are suggestions that triggering article 50 in March – signalling the formal process of exiting the EU – could prompt firms to start implementing contingency plans to ensure they are able to continue conducting business while a Brexit deal is agreed. Boleat said: “Theresa May’s government has the most complex and nationally important international negotiations since the end of second world war ahead of it, and for the good of British business and workers in Britain we must get this right.” Despite his urge for clarity, Boleat added: “I have no doubt that whatever happens in 2017 that the City of London will remain the world’s leading financial centre. However we cannot be complacent and must continue investing in infrastructure and education while working to secure the best possible business links with the European Union and the world.” The corporation has published data showing that financial and professional and financial services employ more than 2.2 million people across the UK, not just in the City. Boleat did not outline the detail of what he thought a transition agreement should contain. He is not alone in calling for such a deal. Sam Woods deputy governor of the Bank of England, told MPs on the Treasury select committee earlier this month that details of that arrangement would be needed within nine months of article 50 being triggered. Woods told the MPs that firms could roll out their contingency plans in a few months. Chancellor Philip Hammond has said the government would seek a transitional deal to help smooth the Brexit process in order to avoid disruption that could risk Britain’s “financial stability”.

{ "title":"Prince Charles: rising intolerance risks repeat of horrors of past", "content": "The Prince of Wales has warned that the rise of populist extremism and intolerance towards other faiths risks repeating the “horrors” of the Holocaust. Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s religious Thought for the Day slot, the prince delivered an outspoken attack against religious hatred and pleaded for a welcoming attitude to those fleeing persecution. He said: “We are now seeing the rise of many populist groups across the world that are increasingly aggressive to those who adhere to a minority faith. All of this has deeply disturbing echoes of the dark days of the 1930s. “My parents’ generation fought and died in a battle against intolerance, monstrous extremism and inhuman attempts to exterminate the Jewish population of Europe.” The prince did not mention any politicians by name, but his address will be seen by some as a veiled reference to the election of Donald Trump in the US, the rise of the far right in Europe, and increasingly hostile attitudes to refugees in the UK. “That nearly 70 years later we should still be seeing such evil persecution is to me beyond all belief,” he said. “We owe it to those who suffered and died so horribly not to repeat the horrors of the past.” BBC Radio 4 Today (@BBCr4today) "Whichever religious path we follow, the destination is the same: to value and respect the other person" - The Prince of Wales' TFTD pic.twitter.com/qUIeWar7cC December 22, 2016 Prince Charles said religious hatred was on the increase, leading to a rise in refugees fleeing persecution. “According to the United Nations, 5.8 million more people abandoned their homes in 2015 than the year before, bringing the annual total to a staggering 65.3 million. That is almost equivalent to the entire population of the United Kingdom,” he said. “The suffering doesn’t end when they arrive seeking refuge in a foreign land.” The prince urged listeners this Christmas to remember “how the story of the Nativity unfolds with the fleeing of the holy family to escape violent persecution”. He added: “We might also remember that when the prophet Muhammad migrated from Mecca to Medina, he did so because he too was seeking the freedom for himself and his followers to worship.” Queen and Prince Philip delay Christmas travel plans after falling ill Read more The prince recalled meeting a Jesuit priest from Syria. “He told me of mass kidnappings in parts of Syria and Iraq, and how he feared that Christians would be driven en masse out of lands described in the Bible,” he said. “He thought it quite possible there would be no Christians in Iraq within five years.” He continued: “The scale of religious persecution around the world is not widely appreciated. Nor is it limited to Christians in the troubled regions of the Middle East.” He then cited a recent report that found an increase in attacks on minority faiths. The Labour MEP Claude Moraes, chair of the European parliament’s civil liberties, justice and home affairs committee, welcomed the prince’s intervention. He said it was “obvious” which politicians the prince was referring to, “but for protocol reasons he can’t say”. Moraes told the Guardian: “It was a good intervention I think when the right and rightwing UK newspapers dominate the anti-refugee, intolerance, and anti-EU protectionist narrative.” The prince was invited to speak as part of BBC Radio 4’s religious programming. It was the third time the heir to the throne had given the address. He first broadcast in the Thought for the Day slot on the anniversary of VE Day in 1995, and did so again in January 2000 to mark the new millennium. He pre-recorded his message on Monday at his official London home, Clarence House, before it was announced that the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh had delayed plans to travel to Norfolk for Christmas, because of illness. The prince did not mention the health of his parents.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Trump calls on US to 'greatly strengthen and expand' nuclear weapons capability", "content": "US President-elect Donald Trump called on Thursday for a strengthening of America’s nuclear weapons programme, throwing into doubt longstanding efforts to reduce its arsenal. On Thursday, Trump tweeted: “The United States must greatly strengthen and expand its nuclear capability until such time as the world comes to its senses regarding nukes.” It was unclear what prompted the comment on a medium that favours brevity over context. But it came on the same day that also President Vladimir Putin addressed Russia’s nuclear capacity. Nuclear weapons: how foreign hotspots could test Trump's finger on the trigger Read more “We need to strengthen the military potential of strategic nuclear forces, especially with missile complexes that can reliably penetrate any existing and prospective missile defence systems,” Putin said. Trump spokesman Jason Miller later issued a statement to NBC News, which did not add much clarity. Miller referred “to the threat of nuclear proliferation and the critical need to prevent it, particularly to and among terrorist organizations and unstable and rogue regimes”. Trump, Miller said, “has also emphasized the need to improve and modernize our deterrent capability as a vital way to pursue peace through strength”. Asked if this meant Trump was not in fact calling for more nuclear weapons, NBC reported, Miller did not respond. There are more than 15,000 nuclear weapons in the world, over 90% of which are in the US and Russia. Since the end of the cold war, the old rivals have worked to curtail production and then cut their nuclear stockpiles. But relations have deteriorated significantly in recent years, while Trump’s freewheeling election campaign has shaken up many former certainties. In May, he suggested he could support South Korea, Japan and Saudi Arabia arming themselves with nuclear weapons for their own defence. “It’s going to happen anyway,” he told CNN. “It’s only a question of time.” In a Republican primary debate, Trump seemed stumped by a straightforward question about the nuclear triad. And in a presidential debate, he appeared to contradict himself over the policy of first use, eventually saying: “I can’t take anything off the table.” During the campaign, Hillary Clinton hammered him as too erratic and volatile, saying more than once: “A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons.” Ten former nuclear missile launch operators also wrote that Trump lacks the temperament and diplomatic skill to avoid nuclear war. On Thursday the state department declined to comment on whether Trump’s tweet called his temperament into question. “Not for me to say,” spokesperson John Kirby said. “I can’t speak for the president-elect’s nuclear views or policy going forward.” Kirby was not aware of any countries expressing concern over the tweet, he added. Trump’s transition website says he “recognizes the uniquely catastrophic threats posed by nuclear weapons and cyberattacks”, adding that he will modernise the nuclear arsenal “to ensure it continues to be an effective deterrent”. But his latest statement appears to put him, once again, at odds with Barack Obama, who in a speech in Prague in 2009 outlined an aspiration for a planet without nuclear weapons while acknowledging it might not happen in his lifetime. Obama has trumpeted the Iran nuclear deal but in April this year told his final nuclear security summit in Washington that terrorist “madmen” obtaining and using a nuclear weapon is one of the greatest threats to global security. Fifty world leaders attended but Putin was not among them. Trump, who is at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida for the holidays, met incoming White House national security adviser Michael Flynn on Wednesday, along with a dozen Pentagon officials involved with defence acquisition programmes and chief executives of Lockheed Martin and Boeing, the country’s two biggest defence contractors. US ballistic missile submarines, bombers, and land-based missiles – the nuclear triad – are expected to reach the end of their useful lives over the next decade. Maintaining and modernising the arsenal is expected to cost about $1tn over 30 years.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Riot officers called in to contain disturbance at Kent prison", "content": "Prison riot officers have been sent in to quell the latest disturbance in a British jail after about 60 prisoners took control of part of HMP Swaleside on the Isle of Sheppey. The prison service said it sent in the specialist Tornado team to deal with a disturbance involving 60 prisoners on the prison’s A-wing on Thursday evening. It later said the incident had been contained and all prisoners had been returned to their cells by 1am on Friday, the BBC reported. The Prison Officers Association chairman, Mike Rolfe, said earlier that fires had been lit in the prison. The category B prison, which is run by HM Prison Service, is one of a cluster of three on Sheppey in Kent. “We are not sure how bad it is yet, but we understand 60 prisoners have taken control of A wing there,” Rolfe said. “Some fires have been lit, apparently.” Facebook Twitter Pinterest One Tornado team have entered the prison already, while others are en route. Photograph: Victoria Jones/PA The trouble at Swaleside comes shortly after one of the worst prison riots in decades at the G4S-run HMP Birmingham. Specialist prison officer Tornado teams were sent in after one inmate was seriously injured and others set fires and stole keys to residential areas from a guard last Friday. On Monday, the justice secretary, Liz Truss, said the firm should foot the bill for the 12-hour disturbance. Swaleside has a capacity of about 1,100 inmates serving prison terms of more than four years. It has eight wings comprised of single cells. The shadow justice spokesman Richard Burgon said: “This is yet more troubling news from our prisons. In July, the independent monitoring board said this prison is not safe and staff shortage is the major cause. As with the Birmingham prison, the public will once again wonder what action the justice secretary actually took in response to the board’s concerns. She needs to tell us.” Truss did not respond on Thursday. An HM Inspectorate of Prisons (HMIP) report in July described the prison as “dangerous” and found levels of violence were “far too high”, with many of the incidents serious. A survey found 69% of inmates had felt unsafe at some point – a result that was significantly higher than at similar facilities. More than half of prisoners polled said it was easy or very easy to get drugs at the prison, while 45% said the same about alcohol. HMIP also said the use of force was high, while the segregation unit was described as “filthy”. The A wing of the prison houses a study centre with a computer suite. At the time of the HMIP report, inspectors said it was used by 50 of the 126 prisoners on the wing who were enrolled on open and distance learning courses. Facebook Twitter Pinterest The scene from inside Swaleside this evening Photograph: BBC The latest trouble marks the fourth such incident at an English prison in less than two months. Besides the rioting at Birmingham, which involved more than a hundred prisoners, there was also a major disturbance involving about 200 prisoners at HMP Bedford. That came just days after a national response unit had to be brought in to control prisoners after a six-hour incident at HMP Lewes in East Sussex. Addressing the Birmingham riot on Monday, Truss said the job of improving conditions in Britain’s prisons would be difficult and lengthy. “It is important to remember that these problems have developed over a number of years and it will take time and it will take concerted effort to turn the situation round ... The issues in our prisons are longstanding and they are not going to be completely solved in weeks or even months,” she said in a statement to MPs. Truss added: “As I have said before, levels of violence are too high in our prisons. We also have very concerning levels of self-harm and deaths in custody. That is why we are reforming our prisons to be safe and purposeful places and taking swift action to deal with drugs, drones and phones.” In early November, before the latest incidents, Truss announced an extra 2,500 prison officers would be recruited at a cost of £104m to tackle “unacceptable” levels of violence in jails across England and Wales.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Activist can sue Trump golf resort for breach of privacy, court rules", "content": "A court in Edinburgh has ruled that an environmental activist can sue Donald Trump’s golf resort near Aberdeen for breach of privacy and compensation after she was apparently filmed without her consent on the course. A lawyer acting for Rohan Beyts, a long-time critic of resort’s impact on the environment and community, accused Trump’s staff of breaching the Data Protection Act by taking mobile-phone footage of her in April as she allegedly urinated behind a dune on the course. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Rohan Beyts. Photograph: Murdo Macleod for the Guardian The ruling raises the prospect of Trump facing a battle in the Scottish small claims court a few months into his first term as US president. The Guardian revealed in August that Trump International Golf Course Scotland, which is wholly owned by Trump, had breached the UK’s strict laws on data protection and privacy after it failed to register with the Information Commissioner’s Office, despite operating an extensive CCTV system and handling data on thousands of golfers, guests, staff and suppliers. The resort insisted this was due to a clerical error. Beyts’s lawyer, Mike Dailly, said the result was fantastic. “Although the defendant sought to have the case dismissed as incompetent, or transferred to the ordinary courts with unlimited expenses, or transferred to Aberdeen, all attempts to stop the case progressing were rejected by the sheriff,” he said. “So now there is a case to answer, and witnesses will have to give evidence on behalf of TIGC”. Beyts, 62, told the Guardian she was delighted with the result and looked forward to making her case. The case arose from an incident last April when Beyts and a friend used a public footpath across the Trump course to reach the sand dunes and beach that border the golf links. Returning from their walk, the pair say there were challenged by resort staff and then photographed by a local newspaper photographer. Three days Beyts was visited at home by two Police Scotland officers who formally charged her with public annoyance. A third officer in charge of the complaint told her that two members of Trump’s staff and a guest on the course had filmed her on their mobile phones as she ducked out of sight. Her prosecution raised fresh accusations from Trump’s critics that his staff were deliberately persecuting opponents and closely monitoring their movements on the resort. The claim was heard before Sheriff Gordon Liddle on Thursday morning, who swiftly dispatched the arguments made by Paul Motion, the solicitor advocate acting for the resort. Dailly argued that the case was a straightforward claim for invasion of privacy, on the basis that the resort had admitted it was not registered with the ICO, and that being filmed without her consent had caused distress to Beyts, for which she was seeking £3,000. Motion questioned whether a small claims court was competent to deal with such a case. Liddle concluded, however, that while he was aware that he was “dealing with ifs and buts, not black and white”, nothing had persuaded him that the case was incompetent as a small claim. When Motion argued that the case should be held in Aberdeen, closer to the golf course and relevant witnesses, Liddle quipped: “Should I transfer it to Manhattan?” before noting that there was no reason why Beyts could not sue a company in the place where it had a registered office, in this case, Edinburgh. Liddle was staunch in his defence of the principle of the small claims court when Motion argued that the case should be transferred to the ordinary courts. The sheriff said: “The effect of sending it to ordinary proceedings may well be [that Beyts] is discouraged from pursuing it because of the expense implications.” The limit on expenses was an “essential component” of the small claims system, he said. TIGCS said: “Our position on Rohan Beyt’s claim remains unchanged and the matter is now in the hands of our lawyers.” The next hearing is set to begin on 3 April and last for three days.",diasaster:0},

Retail sales growth will slip back to around 1.7% in 2016 from about 1.8% this year, according to the KPMG/Ipsos retail thinktank, despite the fact that most consumers have more money in their pockets. But people are now looking to spend their money on restaurants, pubs and cinemas as well as on trips to the high street. Tough year ahead for UK retailers, with supermarkets set to be hardest hit Read more “Consumers are looking beyond retail for goods and services to spend their money on,” said panel member Maureen Hinton, an analyst at consultancy Conlumino. “This is making it much harder for an oversubscribed retail sector. Leisure, culture, entertainment have shown much stronger growth than retail over the past five years and this trend is being exacerbated by an ageing population.” Pubs, restaurants, hotels and other leisure activities have enjoyed strong growth in 2015 – up 11.4% according to credit and debit card operator Barclaycard, while supermarkets have found the going tough. Food and drink shopping saw the weakest growth of all the categories Barclaycard measures – up just 1.1%. With overall market growth low, traditional supermarkets will continue to face pressure from the rapidly expanding discounters Aldi and Lidl which continue to open stores. Amazon is also ramping up its food delivery services in the UK – with plans to add more products to its Pantry range and rumours that it will launch fresh food in 2016. “Volumes are not rising enough to support all this expansion and there has to be some consolidation in the sector to take out the excess supply,” Hinton said. Meanwhile, the KPMG/Ipsos thinktank believes homeowners will put spare cash towards paying off the mortgage and paying tradesmen to update their properties rather than spending more on clothing or food in 2016. With such a tough environment, the thinktank said it would be difficult for retailers to put up prices to offset cost increases resulting from the implementation of the “national living wage”, which comes into force in April, as well as rises in business rates – a combination Tesco boss Dave Lewis has described as a “lethal cocktail.”",diasaster:0},

As northern England recovers from the devastating effects of Storm Eva (perhaps mopping sodden houses for the second or third time in a month) the weather seems the only topic of conversation. But it is not just the UK experiencing remarkable weather. From unseasonably warm temperatures across Europe and the eastern US, to highly unusual tornadoes ripping across the central US, wildfires and fierce summer heat in Australia and extreme flooding in South America, the world’s weather is very much out of kilter.

That is the view of Peter Navarro, the man chosen by Donald Trump to lead a new presidential office for US trade and industrial policy, a move likely to add to Beijing’s anxieties over the billionaire’s plans for US-China relations. China’s rulers initially appeared to embrace the possibility that improved ties with Washington could be negotiated with the deal-making US president-elect. Trump and China: fears that deal-making will consign human rights to political 'roadkill' Read more “We must welcome him,” said one prominent foreign policy expert. But that enthusiasm has dimmed after Trump angered Beijing with a succession of controversial interventions on sensitive issues including Taiwan and the South China Sea. The appointment of Navarro, a University of California, Irvine business professor, to run the White House’s newly created national trade council, represents a further blow to those hopes. Trump’s team described the 67-year-old academic, who is infamous in China watching circles for being a radical hawk, as “a brilliant policy mind and a tireless worker”. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Peter Navarro Photograph: Courtesy of Peter Navarro But Beijing is unlikely to second such emotions. Navarro has penned a number of vociferously anti-China tomes including Death by China and Crouching Tiger: What China’s Militarism Means for the World. In The Coming China Wars – a 2006 book that Trump has called one of his favourite on China – Navarro portrays the Asian country as a nightmarish realm where “the raw stench of a gut-wrenching, sweat-stained fear” hangs in the air and myopic, venal and incompetent Communist party officials rule the roost. Top Trump adviser: News Corp bashes him due to commercial interest in China Read more The Harvard-educated hardliner accuses “cheating China” of destroying both American factories and lives by flooding the US with illegally subsidised and “contaminated, defective and cancerous” exports. American politicians must “aggressively and comprehensively address the China problem” before it leads to full-blown conflict, Navarro writes. In a 2012 Netflix documentary based on Death by China, which Trump has described as “right on”, Navarro blames Beijing for the loss of 57,000 American factories and 25m jobs. “The repressive communist government [is] now victimising both American and Chinese citizens alike,” the film claims. “Help defend America and protect your family: don’t buy made in China,” Navarro tells viewers in an introduction to the 80-minute polemic, which is narrated by Martin Sheen. Navarro, who has also dubbed China a “global pollution factory” and “disease incubator”, made no secret of his distaste for its rulers during Trump’s election campaign. Facebook Twitter Pinterest An image from Peter Navarro’s 2012 documentary Death by China Photograph: Netflix Speaking to the Guardian in July at a resort near his home in Laguna Beach the academic railed against how China’s “brutal, authoritarian communist government” had decimated the US economy. He painted China as a ravenous bully and said he agreed with Trump’s claim that Beijing was guilty of “raping our country” over trade. “It’s an apt description of the damage and carnage that China’s trade policies have wrought on the American economic heartland. What’s happening is rapacious,” Navarro said. Speaking shortly before Navarro’s appointment was confirmed, Andrew Nathan, a China expert at Columbia University, said Trump’s plans for relations with Beijing remained an enigma despite the presence of several prominent China hawks in his camp. “Trump has shown two sides to his personality in dealing with everybody. One is: ‘Let’s make a deal, we are deal-makers.’ And the other one is: ‘You hurt my feelings and I’m going to bomb the shit out of you because I never lose – I always win’,” said the political scientist. “I don’t know whether he is setting up China for a deal. In fact, I don’t know if he is that deliberate or whether his mood just changes from time-to-time depending on how the other side treats him.” Nathan, the author of a book on foreign policy called China’s Search For Security, said he believed Beijing would still be banking on its ability to win over the tycoon. “I think predominantly they understand Trump as a businessman – and that for them is a glimmer of hope,” he said. Christopher Balding, a Peking University finance professor, said that for all Navarro’s “alarmist” and “inflammatory” musings on China, he was unlikely to be able to follow through on his most radical beliefs once in government. Australia, China, and the lunacy of Trump's talk of a trade war | Bob Carr Read more “I think Navarro is going to quickly realise the constraints that he is under,” he said. “They come as professors, they come as businessmen and they get into office as the secretary-of-whatever and they quickly realise ... that they cannot just implement their pet idea or their classroom theory,” Balding said, predicting there would be “strong push-back” from the US business community were hefty tariffs to be imposed on imports from China. Li Yonghui, the head of the school of international relations at the Beijing Foreign Studies University, said Navarro’s rise was consistent with Trump’s hawkish thoughts on China and would leave Beijing “a little worried” even if he still believed a radical shake-up of US-China relations was unlikely. “We should stay vigilant. We have to be prepared,” the academic said. “Trump will certainly place unprecedented pressure on China.” Asked for Beijing’s reaction to Trump’s hire, a spokesperson for China’s foreign ministry replied only that it was closely monitoring the transition and possible policy directions. “As two superpowers, China and the US have extensive common interests,” Hua Chunying told reporters. “Cooperation is the only correct choice.” Additional reporting by Christy Yao",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Corbyn says May must come clean over UK-made cluster bombs", "content": "Theresa May must explain why it took so long for the government to establish that British-made cluster bombs banned by an international treaty were dropped by Saudi Arabia in Yemen, Jeremy Corbyn has said. The Labour leader said there was “pretty strong evidence” available for months that cluster bombs sold from the UK in the 1980s had been deployed in the current conflict in Yemen, even though that was denied by Saudi Arabia and rejected by government ministers in May. The Guardian view on Yemen: stop helping the killing | Editorial Read more Michael Fallon, the defence secretary, only admitted on Monday that a limited number of British cluster bombs from the 1980s had been used after an official confirmation from Saudi Arabia. He made a statement to the House of Commons the day after the Guardian revealed the existence of a UK government analysis indicating the bombs had been used and which had been available to ministers for about a month. Speaking to the Guardian, Corbyn said May and Fallon should both explain why it took so long for the UK to establish the truth. “I raised the issue of arms supplies, as did Emily [Thornberry], and a television programme that indicated pretty strong evidence of cluster bombs was there. So why it’s taken this length of time, I think they do have some questions to answer,” he said. The use of the cluster bombs is particularly controversial because the UK is a signatory to the Ottawa convention banning their deployment or assistance with their deployment, although Saudi Arabia is not. They contain dozens of bomblets that can explode at a later date, causing indiscriminate killing and maiming of civilians. The Labour leader also called on the government again to reconsider current arms sales to Saudi Arabia in light of the US suspension of some planned military exports. He said: “We have to ask the question about this relationship with Saudi Arabia, their bombing of targets all over Yemen, vast numbers of people being forced into exile and the huge number of deaths there. It is a terrible situation. I have had discussions with UN officials and there has to be a political process to bring about a ceasefire as there does in Syria. “Even the US has suspended some military supplies to Saudi Arabia. Why can’t we do the same?” He went on to raise concerns about the functioning of the parliamentary watchdog on arms export controls, known as the quadripartite committee because it is made up of members of the foreign affairs, business, defence and international development committees. A suspension of arms sales to Saudi Arabia until there has been an international investigation into alleged war crimes was backed in September by MPs on two parliamentary committees – the business and international development groupings – as well as the chair of the arms export control committee. They said the reported use of cluster bombs “calls into question the coalition’s wider respect for the rules of war”. A third group of MPs, the foreign affairs select committee, disagreed and suggested it should be decided next year by a court that is hearing a legal challenge from the Campaign Against Arms Trade. A fourth committee, the defence select committee, declined to endorse either conclusion. Amid an ongoing row, Corbyn called for the committee on arms export controls to be put on a proper footing as a parliamentary select committee to enable better scrutiny. May declined to answer a question about when she was made aware of the use of UK cluster bombs when asked by Angus Robertson, the Scottish National party’s Westminster leader, earlier this week. “Is it true that senior ministers have known for some time that UK cluster munitions have been used in the current conflict in Yemen?” he said. “When was she told about that, and when will the UK join our European partners in starting to have a more ethical foreign policy on both Saudi Arabia and Yemen?” Downing Street has not yet replied to a request for comment.",diasaster:0},

Ahead of the 11am opening, she had visited the service held for stallholders and market-goers in the Kaiser Wilhelm memorial church, at the foot of which the lorry had come to a halt. “It was a good thing to get everyone together, even though there’s little comfort to be had from words right now,” she said. Martin Germer, the church’s pastor who has been acting as a counsellor for stallholders and some of the relatives of the 12 people who died and the dozens of others injured in the attack, told the congregation: “It feels right to be opening up the market again as a sign of our determination to keep going.” On the door of his church he had put up a sign which read: “Shocked and saddened, we think of the people who died on Monday, 19 December, right next to our church. They have been torn out of our lives so suddenly. Our thoughts and prayers are with the injured [of] body and soul and with the families of all the victims.” Inside the church, bathed in the calming marine light of its stained-glass windows, members of the public queued to sign condolence books.

On hearing the crash, he recalled, he had run over to help rescue the injured – and had stumbled over dead bodies. “I will never forget what I saw, and I can’t begin to put it into words,” he said. But he said he took some comfort from believing the consequences of the attack might have been much worse. “There was a gas canister from a bratwurst stall, I think, which was punctured or leaking as a result of the impact, the owner shouted out that it might explode,” he said, declining to give his surname. “While someone tried to turn off the supply I ran around telling stallholders to run, realising the chain reaction which might occur if it exploded, which doesn’t bear thinking about,” he said.

Each was four metres long, 60cm wide and a metre high; they were needed to make people feel safe, said Michael Roden, head of Berlin’s stallholder and fairground association. “We need to get back to a state of normality as soon as possible and need at the same time to reassure people that what happened can’t be repeated,” he said. “We spoke for years about the possibility of something like this happening – I’ve been working here for 30 years – but never in my wildest dreams could I have imagined something like this.” At the place where the Scania truck had come off the road, cutting through the stalls and careering down the lane of wooden huts, the barriers were placed two or three deep. A black-and-white canvas picture of the square resting on an easel marked the now-empty space where wooden huts destroyed in the impact had stood. Some of the debris from the crash was still visible behind red plastic sheeting – broken beer bottles and Christmas decor, a ripped alpine backdrop and a shattered wooden canopy swing.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"The Guardian view on Prince Charles: a cheer for tolerance", "content": "Prince Charles’s Thought for the Day in this morning’s Today programme was well received far beyond his normal circle of support. After all the reverses that have marked out 2016 as the average liberal’s annus horribilis, a plea for tolerance from the heir to the throne was an unexpectedly welcome intervention. With a public debate soured after Brexit and the election of Donald Trump, it held a hint of regal rebuke, not least for the UK government for denying visas to bishops of the Syriac church whose persecution he was highlighting. Yet the actions of an institution as effective at managing public opinion as the monarchy should always be closely examined. The prince has only done Thought for the Day twice before, and he took this opportunity to tidy up some loose ends. Without reneging on an ambition he expressed in an interview in 1994 to be “defender of faith” rather than “the faith”, he made his loyalty to the Christian church explicit. His appearance was also a public confirmation that the twitchy relationship he has with the BBC was on an improving trend. It is more than a decade since the notorious off-camera display of animosity by Charles to the corporation’s royal correspondent Nicholas Witchell, but last year an unflattering documentary about the prince and his PR man Mark Bolland in the wake of the death of Princess Diana was delayed in a row over picture rights. So there is at least a restoration of amity, a sense that is endorsed by a second appearance on Radio 4 within a week, when on Christmas Day the prince features in a special edition of the comedy show Just a Minute. No institution survives – and certainly not, like the monarchy, for more than 300 years – without developing a nimble approach to compromise and concession. But this is about much more than the palace and the BBC. In only a few days a succession of small developments taken together amount to the kind of policy advance by stealth that is the hallmark of many successful royal initiatives. The Queen, who celebrated her 90th birthday this year and remains as popular and admired as ever, is stepping back from some of her good causes; last weekend, a new photographic portrait of her, seated, with Charles looming over her, was released to mark the end of her momentous year. Then, in a rare and unplanned intimation of mortality, the Queen and Prince Philip had to delay setting off for Christmas at Sandringham because both have heavy colds. Quietly, a sense of the inevitability of the succession has been reinforced. The prince’s standing in public opinion has significantly improved since he married Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, in 2005, when an Ipsos Mori poll found barely 40% thought he would make a good king. Now he has 60% approval according to a survey earlier this year. It also found that the monarchy was thought to have an important role to play now and in the future, and that monarchy was preferred over a republic by 76% to 17% – a margin that increased if people were asked if they would prefer an elected president to a monarchy. That was when Barack Obama still had nearly a year ahead of him in the White House and Donald Trump was the joke presidential candidate. The monarchy may now have added lustre. All the same, like the whole ramshackle British constitution, it should always be kept under review.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Paris tones down new year celebrations in wake of terror attacks", "content": "Erik Modenese scans the half-filled terraces of the bars, cafes and restaurants lining rue Montorgueil in central Paris, and ruminates that nearly seven weeks after the deadly 13 November terror attacks, business – and life – has yet to return to normal. “We’re all still around 10% lower than usual despite the magnificent spring-like weather. New Year’s Eve activity will be down too,” says Modenese, manager of the Le Compas restaurant-bar north of les Halles which, like other Parisian bars and clubs, saw business slump by nearly half following the attacks. “Parisians are finally starting to go out again, but the tourists still aren’t back in big numbers,” he says. “The attacks are still having an impact.” Less than two months after coordinated terror strikes on popular nightlife spots in and around the French capital left 130 people dead and hundreds injured, concerns about renewed violence still influence the activities of residents, tourists and officials. Heightened security measures are also changing the look and atmosphere of daily life. Thousands of military and police reinforcements have been deployed across the city and country, with patrolling soldiers in purple berets, matching khaki uniforms and flak vests, automatic weapons gripped to their chests now a common sight. On Christmas Eve alone, 120,000 security forces guarded churches and public venues across France. Paris police authorities say 9,000 officers – more than 80% of the area’s total force – will be deployed across the capital on 31 December. Terror fears are also dampening the run-up to Paris’s New Year’s Eve festivities – traditionally a high point on the city’s tourism calendar. This year, Paris’s official celebrations are being scaled back, with authorities expecting fewer French and foreign visitors at year-end events that frequently draw more than 600,000 revellers to the Champs Elysées. Initially torn about whether to cancel festivities altogether, the Paris authorities instead decided to tone them down with security concerns in mind. The customary fireworks show, for example, will be replaced by a video displayed on the Arc de Triomphe, and access to the Champs Elysées will be closed after 8pm to restrict crowds. In announcing the modified new year agenda, Paris’s mayor, Anne Hidalgo, acknowledged “the event will be above all symbolic” amid enduring terror fears, aiming instead “at sending out a message to the whole world – Paris is standing and the Parisians continue to live”. But symbolism alone won’t bring relief to suffering businesses that depend on Parisians living, socialising and celebrating in quasi-public venues. “It will be a disappointing new year, especially for bars and cafes relying heavily on tourists, and popular neighbourhood hangouts such as those targeted in the attacks,” says Alexandre Bernard, manager of the Café Père et Fils on the rue Montmartre near the Paris Bourse – whose own 50% drop in business following the attacks has been reversed amid daytime custom from surrounding office buildings. Generally, Bernard says, “This will be a hard year for the sector … and it may only be the start if extremists keep the terror pressure high into 2016.” Travel research company ForwardKeys said in a 24 November report that future airline bookings to Paris, which plunged after the strikes, are still 27% lower than last year. Industry organisations also estimate hotel room reservations in the city have recovered only half of their 30% post-attack slide. The CSCAD union representing Paris nightclub, theatre, restaurant and bar owners says activity remains up to 40% lower than in the last two months of 2014, with tourist revenues down 60-80%. Those declines are even more damaging, the CSCAS says, because of affected businesses also being forced to boost security spending. American tourists Geoffrey Hughes and Blaire Andres say they have encountered extra security measures at places such as the Louvre and Pompidou Centre that offset any time saved in navigating thinner Paris crowds. Andres, 26 – who like Hughes lives in London – says the sight of police patrolling with automatic weapons at the ready “can actually be more unsettling than reassuring if you aren’t used to seeing that in public”. But both add they never seriously considered altering their plans to visit Paris after the November attacks, and suspect people are misreading the current terror threat and French responses to it. “That’s sort of ‘lightning striking twice in the same spot’ logic,” says Hughes, 31, an anthropologist at the London School of Economics. “There’s probably no time safer to come here than now.”",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Yew sets ancient tone of burial ground", "content": "It might be thought that when Thomas Hardy stepped aside from his narrative in Jude The Obscure to describe Shaston, or Shaftesbury, “on the summit of a steep and imposing scarp, rising … out of the deep alluvial vale of Blackmoor” as “one of the queerest and quaintest spots in England”, he was being unduly fanciful. But if, today, you turn aside from St John’s Hill, close to that summit, in to a small enclosed space beside the road and take in the sight of the ancient yew before you, its limbs spreading out wide and close to the ground above scattered headstones, then look ahead towards the sheer drop into the expanse of the vale, you do catch a sense of the local magic and feel you are indeed in a special place. It is good, therefore, to read a local notice that tells of a campaign by residents, supported by the town council, to “care for this peaceful, ancient and sacred site as it deserves”. Some of the people of the campaign showed me around the burial ground, formerly the graveyard of St John’s church and described by J Hutchins in his book The History and Antiquities of the County of Dorset (1st edition, 1774) as long “ruinated beyond the memory of man”. I was told that both yew and burial ground could date from much earlier, perhaps pre-Christian times. In the 15th century St John’s church was united with St James’s, which still stands, deep in the vale, and the hilltop graveyard came to serve St James’s. It was the position of the churchyard relative to the church that led Hardy to note, that, as one of Shaston’s quaintnesses, “the churchyard lay nearer heaven than the church steeple”. The aim now is to make this place “once again a haven for contemplation, nature and wildlife”. So laurel, which could choke the yews, has been cut back, snowdrops have been planted and pathways created between the headstones (which date from 1662 to 1897). A view has opened up that makes real the sense of an ancient hill town founded by King Alfred.",diasaster:0},

Two female police officers and eight soldiers are said to have engaged in group sex at a police station in the Brussels neighbourhood of Ganshoren while colleagues hunted for terror suspects. The police station was near Molenbeek, where anti-terror raids had been taking place. Police spokesman Johan Berckmans told De Standaard that 15 to 20 soldiers slept at the station for two weeks during the operation in November so they did not have to travel far at the end of their shift. “When they left, they organised a small party to thank the police in the area,” the spokesman told Belgian newspaper La Derniere Heure. “We have launched an investigation to find out what exactly happened.” The Belgian capital was on the highest level of alert last month after the Paris attacks that left 130 people dead. At least three of the nine men suspected of carrying out the attacks were based in Brussels.

{ "title":"Wylfa nuclear plant closes in Wales", "content": "Britain’s oldest nuclear plant closed on Wednesday, leaving in its wake a £700m decommissioning bill and further questions about the UK’s ability to keep the lights on. The closure of the Wylfa plant in Wales after 44 years of service puts more pressure on EDF Energy to take a final investment decision for new reactors at Hinkley in Somerset. The station on the island of Anglesey generated enough electricity to power 1m homes, and with a capacity of 1,000MW was once the largest facility of its kind in the world. But after an earlier life extension scheme expired, the last of the 26 British-designed Magnox reactors was switched off by the private consortium that manages the plant for the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA). Government U-turn on renewables shows gas, oil and nuclear are still favourites Read more The site was due to close in 2010 but it was kept open for a further five years as fears mounted that Britain would face an electricity shortage because new atomic and gas-fired power plants were not being constructed. “Wylfa has been a terrific success story for Anglesey and the UK nuclear industry. We have generated safely and securely for many years, which is an excellent achievement,” said Stuart Law, the site director. It will take another 10 years for the basic decommissioning to be undertaken at a cost of about £700m but the site cannot be redeveloped before the end of the century. High-level waste from Wylfa will remain on Anglesey until a national nuclear waste disposal facility is finally developed. Britain still has a fleet of advanced cooled atomic reactors run by EDF but most of these will be retired by 2023 just as the government has also promised to halt all coal-fired power stations. Hitachi of Japan is leading a Horizon Nuclear Power project to construct a new power plant at Wylfa, with a second earmarked for Oldbury in south Gloucestershire alongside a third facility planned in Cumbria. But the atomic industry’s revived fortunes ride primarily on the Hinkley C plant, which is expected to be the first new site since the Sizewell B station was completed in 1995. Half of £24bn nuclear reactor investment will go to overseas suppliers Read more The £18bn Somerset project has been repeatedly delayed but Chinese investors finally gave their support in the autumn while the government promised the latest in a series of subsidies. EDF signalled in October that it would start work at Hinkley and it is expected to give the formal investment the go ahead within weeks before later saying it may not come until after Christmas. Hinkley Point C, intended to provide about 7% of the UK’s total electricity, was originally scheduled for completion by 2018 but the latest date is 2025. Sceptics still question whether it will make that later date given the experiences of delays and cost overruns with a similar power project at Flamanville in Normandy, northern France. There have also been problems at the new Olkiluoto nuclear plant in Finland which is using the same plant design provided by EDF’s engineering partner Areva at Flamanville and planned for Hinkley. National Grid, Britain’s electricity network operator, has played down the significance of the Wylfa closure and says it has put special measures in place to meet any mid-winter peaks in power demand. Another milestone in the change of Britain from a high to a lower carbon energy producer came two weeks ago when the country’s last deep coal mine, at Kellingley in North Yorkshire, closed.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"The Guardian view on the New Year honours: cranky, compromised but still useful", "content": "It does not seem likely that Barbara Windsor and Lynton Crosby would ever have expected to be members of the same club: the ultimate glamour-girl-turned-national-treasure and the dour-looking Australian political propagandist with a gift for translating a nation’s private prejudices into political pledges would, on the face of it, have little to say to one another over a drink. But they are now both appointed to the topmost rank of the Order of the British Empire, Ms Windsor as a dame commander, Mr Crosby as a knight. What a carry on. Reform to honours system long overdue | Letters Read more The British honours system can only be understood as the living embodiment of the country’s creaky old constitution, an encrusted accumulation of tradition and convenience. There at the top is the small collection of awards that only the Queen can hand out; then come the knights and dames, dusty remnants of a feudal age, followed by carefully ranked honours awarded in the name of a defunct empire. From time to time this curious construct gets a gloss of modernisation, perhaps propelled by a scandal like David Lloyd George’s cash-for-honours, and so it survives for another generation, a hierarchical anachronism that is just not quite daft enough, nor used quite crassly enough, to galvanise a popular movement to overthrow it. The honouring of the Tory campaign boss Lynton Crosby, as a reward for his role in the election victory, may be one of the more egregious examples of the uses of patronage, yet it does not seem to be quite outrageous enough to provoke radical reform. More’s the pity. Most countries have ways of honouring distinction (in Sweden, these include diligent reindeer husbandry), but trying to explain our particular honours system to anyone who did not grow up with it is on a par with introducing them to the rules of cricket. Like human remains exhumed intact from a peat bog, the British honours system is preserved by the environment in which it is embedded. It is based on a medieval king’s need to bind in the land-owning classes to royal service through the awarding of ranks as part-reward and part-encouragement. It has lasted because it was flexible; its first significant enhancement came when the rising power of democracy in the first world war and the needs of total mobilisation led to the creation of the Order of the British Empire, a way of recognising the efforts of ordinary people. Another 50 years passed before, in the 1960s, Harold Wilson’s Labour government began a shift away from awards to those who had served the state towards those who made a contribution to the wider public good: this was the era that gave us MBEs for the Beatles. In the 1990s, John Major introduced public nominations; in the New Labour years, teachers, doctors and nurses – people in the public services – became the focus of attention. But at heart it is a system of patronage that the prime minister of the day can use as a kind of public affirmation of what matters to him or her: they can reward the eminently worthy – Dr Michael Jacobs, who was a leading participant in the campaign against Ebola, gets a knighthood, for example – and also the less obviously worthy (there’s another ladies’ underwear tycoon on the list) alike. And of course they can reward political loyalty and, by omission, punish the disloyal. New Year's honours 2016: the full list Read more It is not chance that the system lingers on and shows no signs of expiring. However tottering a construction of myth and snobbery, its purpose has enduring appeal. There have been some eminent refuseniks – Stephen Hawking, for example, and Vanessa Redgrave, and from an earlier era JB Priestley and even William Gladstone – but only a handful each year reject an honour. But this is not about individual social advancement, nor some financial reward. It is a way of establishing a kind of league table of national values. Like the conveyor belt in a sushi bar, a thousand names are slowly rolled out for popular judgment. Most are uncontentious. The idea of a British Empire Medal may carry a heavy load of outdated symbolism, but no one would question the virtue of the prime mover of the Stockport All Stars steel band, or the special needs support teacher in Stevenage, or the senior lunchtime supervisor at a primary school in Dewsbury. Many may deplore the power of political patronage and dismiss an honours system that fundamentally rests on hereditary monarchy. Yet a state needs some way of marking out citizens for their virtue. It should be a transparent and publicly legitimised process. But even this flawed system has its uses. It defines what we value, as well as what we don’t.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"El Niño: why predictable climate event still has the scientists guessing", "content": "El Niño is one of the most predictable climate events on the planet, according to the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, but it also has a way of keeping climate scientists guessing. In March the oceanographers predicted the current event could be the weakest on record, but in August the same agency warned it could be the strongest. Right now it still looks strong, says Nasa’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Pasadena, California. Using satellite data, meteorologists keep a steady watch on El Niño because it can play out demurely, or it can bring catastrophe. It has been linked to drought and harvest failures on the African continent, devastating fires in the normally moist rainforests of the Indonesian archipelago, both drought and flood in Australia, damaging floods in the Americas, and unusually mild winters in Europe. Power cuts, travel chaos and more flood warnings issued as Storm Frank hits UK Read more This month, tens of thousands of people have been forced to flee their homes in the border areas of Paraguay, Uruguay, Brazil and Argentina due to severe flooding in the wake of heavy summer rains brought on by El Niño. Paraguay’s national emergencies office has said the flooding is “directly influenced by the El Niño phenomenon, which has intensified the frequency and intensity of rains”. El Niño is a blister of sea surface heat that every few years floats eastwards across the tropical Pacific Ocean. It was given its name by the fishermen of Peru, who called it “the Child” because they became aware of it around the Christmas season, as the fish catches failed. The shift of warm seas leaves the western Pacific cooler, and both temperature shifts seem to play out in disruption of global weather patterns. The last great El Niño, in 1997-98, helped make 1998 the then warmest year on record – that too was accompanied by a series of devastating events around the world, among them ice storms in North America, floods on the west coasts of the Americas and forest fires in Borneo. It also delayed the monsoon rains in India, warmed tropical waters so severely that coral reefs started to “bleach” and die, and signalled a record-breaking season of typhoons and tropical cyclones in the eastern Pacific. Although researchers are fairly sure that climate change as a consequence of the combustion of fossil fuels, and the release of greenhouse gases, could make El Niño more frequent, or more devastating, or both, it remains a natural, cyclic event. Climate historians have linked it, with sometimes faltering levels of confidence, to historic events, among them the epidemic of Spanish influenza that claimed millions of lives in 1918 and even the Biblical plagues of Egypt linked to the story of Moses. Minister visits Tadcaster as Yorkshire town braces for more flooding Read more Sometimes oceanographers watch an El Niño develop, and then fade gently. And sometimes it develops powerfully, with consequences for the rest of the globe. Oxfam has already warned that this time millions could face famine as a consequence. However, as the rains fail in Africa, Californians – still in the grip of a prolonged and damaging drought – may see a silver lining. In 1997 and1998 storms slammed into the US west coast, crossed the mountains, drenched Texas and even hit Florida. This time, El Niño may be seen as bringing relief. “The water story for much of the American west over most of the past decade has been dominated by punishing drought,” said JPL climatologist Bill Patzert. “Reservoir levels have fallen to record or near-record lows, while groundwater tables have dropped dangerously in many areas. Now we’re preparing to see the flip side of nature’s water cycle – the arrival of steady, heavy rains and snowfall.” What a heat bubble on the eastern Pacific – where the much warmer water means that a great stretch of ocean is actually up to 25cm higher than the cooler waters north and south of it – means for the UK is much less certain. “There are a number of factors that affect winter conditions in Britain,” the Met Office said earlier this year. “The increase in risk of a colder winter this year from the developing El Niño is currently considered small.”",diasaster:0},

I went to help at Calais’s Jungle refugee camp – and what I saw haunts me | David Kraft Read more These efforts are a powerful rebuke to those who tell us that people who cross borders are to be feared, not welcomed. They remind us that we can let ourselves be ruled by love not hate. It’s the end of year message that I want to hear. So it may seem curmudgeonly to also say that individual empathy has limits. But over the past seven years, working with refugees, I have certainly learned something about the limits of my own. More than 70 women every week come to the drop-in lunches and classes at Women for Refugee Women. I have stopped asking them about their own stories; I find it too hard to hear those tales of torture, rape and imprisonment. I have stopped asking them if they have children; I don’t want to be handed the crumpled photograph of the child they left behind. I have stopped visiting detention centres in the UK; I have seen too many vulnerable women locked up.

I am in awe of those whose generosity leads them to house a destitute asylum seeker who would otherwise be sleeping on damp streets. But their kind hospitality will not enable her to achieve what she really wants, if that is the right to work as the nurse she was back home. I admire those who pack sweaters and tents and take them to the Calais jungle, but all the donated clothes in the world will not stop a young man jumping on a lorry if he really wants to find his brother in Liverpool. At the moment some of our leaders and commentators try to appeal not to our sense of empathy but to our fear when taking action on the refugee crisis. In the face of all the heart-rending stories we read about or encounter,the British government has offered to resettle just a few thousand people. While volunteers on the ground talk about the children who need medical attention or the women who need safety, the government is putting up bigger fences in Calais, offering troops to secure European borders and locking up those who seek asylum in the UK. Cases drag on for years, letters are lost, interviews are cancelled, detention is used arbitrarily The government does this in the name of realism, and says that we need to behave like this in order to keep our society strong and secure. Too much empathy, it’s implied, is unrealistic: we are told we have to be ruled by our heads not our hearts; we have to think about numbers and resources, not individuals and their lives. Yet what is sold to us as realistic is often not in the slightest bit pragmatic. You only have to look at Calais to see that there is nothing efficient about the official government response. It is leading to more and more chaos. Let’s be truly realistic about this: people who have travelled for months into western Europe are not going to melt away back to their homeland. As long as we pretend that we only need to build higher fences, more people will die at the fences. As long as we refuse to create legal routes for families to cross into safety, they will take illegal routes. As long as we fail to recognise people’s humanity, we will create more mess, more suffering, and more resistance. A similar truth can be seen in how we approach those seeking asylum. Over the past few years I have witnessed so much suffering experienced by those who have reached Britain. You would think that a system that is so callous would at least be efficient. Bizarrely, the opposite is true. Chaos rules.

In the bleakness of the Calais migrant camp, a light shines out | Jonathan Freedland Read more Inhumanity does not lead to efficiency. Detention, for instance, is held up by the government as a smart way to run a firm asylum process. But it is more expensive than keeping people in the community – and isn’t even an efficient way of ensuring deportation. It’s time to recognise that empathy is a better basis than fear for pragmatic policy solutions. It is better not only for those who are on the move, but also for us here in Britain. We know we cannot solve this crisis with one donation or one gift; individual empathy, for all its transformative power, needs to be allied to systems that enable it to flourish. Truly realistic solutions from our government would recognise this, and take account of actual needs on the ground. That would mean more people resettled from Syria. It would also mean a humane overhaul of the asylum system so that once people come here they find a transparent process that gives them a fair hearing, and the right to live in the community during this time. We should be finding routes by which refugees with links to the UK could be brought here safely rather than abandoned to the mud and the cold.

Ocado shares have now fallen 8% since Christmas Eve, closing at 315p on Wednesday. Amazon UK to expand grocery range as supermarkets look on warily Read more Amazon Pantry, which launched in November, offers a range of 4,000 grocery and household products, from big brands such as Kellogg’s, Ariel , Colgate and Kronenbourg. The company charges £2.99 for the delivery of one large box of goods to people signed up to its Prime subscription service. Christopher North, the UK boss of the online retailer, told the Guardian this week that Amazon was “really happy with the early numbers,” on Pantry in the UK. It plans to add thousands more products over the coming months. The service is seen as a first step towards Amazon upgrading its delivery service in the UK to fresh food, which would provide a more direct challenge to UK supermarkets, and Ocado. Analysts said Amazon’s focus on London added further pressure on Ocado, which has a strong customer base in the capital. Investors and analysts had speculated that Amazon might seek to buy Ocado as a shortcut into the British grocery market, but the US company’s determination to build its own service indicates that a bid is unlikely.

But with just one day to go before 2015 is up, the retailer looks unlikely to meet its ambition. “It’s nearly the last day of the year and there’s been no deal and so some people are giving up saying it’s never going to happen,” said Bruno Monteyne at Bernstein Research. “Ocado is not priced as a food retailer.

{ "title":"Review launched after airport shops found to not pass on VAT savings", "content": "The government is launching a review into airport retail taxes after revealing that shops are ripping off travellers by failing to pass on up to 50% of their VAT savings to customers. George Osborne described the practice as unacceptable, as he highlighted research by HMRC showing that some stores are keeping as much as 50p in every £1 of their VAT discounts without passing them on. Anger over VAT relief in airports triggered a consumer revolt in the summer, with customers threatening to refuse requests from retailers to hand over their boarding cards when making purchases. It emerged that retailers were using information on the cards to secure a tax saving, because most goods sold by airport stores to passengers travelling outside the European Union are exempt from VAT charges of up to 20%. “VAT relief at airports is intended to cut prices for those travellers – not be a windfall gain for shops,” said the chancellor. “But many people could be paying over the odds for their purchases because the government’s VAT concession isn’t passed on. This is simply unacceptable. I have launched a review to make sure that this VAT relief benefits those it’s intended for – consumers.” We were duped by the duty free – victims of the alienating power of airports | Hannah Jane Parkinson Read more Travellers rebelling against the VAT relief regime in the summer said they felt obliged to hand over boarding cards at checkouts for security reasons or because they were getting a discount. The review is expected to report in early 2016, and will also look into other tax breaks at airports, including duty free and extra-statutory concession relief, which covers retailers’ exemption from payment of VAT on goods sold in duty free and tax free shops. At the time, the financial secretary to the Treasury, David Gauke, claimed that some of Britain’s top retailers were pocketing millions of pounds from the VAT discounts. Retailers including Boots, Dixons and WH Smith were criticised for not passing on discounts to individuals who were travelling outside the EU. Martin Lewis, founder of MoneySavingExpert.com, said: “It’s nice to see the government catching up with what the rest of us have been saying for a long time. “Airport retailers have been taking the mick. Even after the huge fuss last summer when you walk into a WH Smith at the airport and use the self-service till it asks for your boarding pass and if you do show it, the retailer gains and you don’t.” He said retailers were potentially holding on to more than half of the VAT savings and should be offering non-EU travellers discounts at the till. Lewis said passengers should not show their boarding cards, except in duty free stores where it is necessary, unless they got a discount. Retailers say it is too complex to give discounts to individuals flying outside the EU only and that the savings are instead spread across all goods in airport stores. A spokesperson for Boots said: “Rather than offering different price points to some customers travelling outside the EU, we want all customers to benefit from consistently low prices. “In fact, over the past few years we have invested in lowering prices in our airport stores, despite operating costs at airports being higher than in other locations. We already offer the lowest prices of any retailer on many items sold airside.” The spokesperson said it had never been compulsory for shoppers to hand over their boarding passes and its assistants are currently not asking customers for them while it undertakes a “long term review of this situation”. Boots said many of the items it sells are not subject to VAT or are only charged at a low rate, a similar position to WH Smith. WH Smith says over half its sales at airports, including books, sandwiches and magazines, are not subject to the sales tax. “The limited benefit that we obtain in our other product categories, where customers travel outside of the EU only, is reflected in our single pricing policy for all customers, which overall provides better value,” a spokesman for WH Smith said. A spokesperson for Dixons Travel, the electrical goods retailer, said: “To ensure all customers visiting our airport stores receive excellent value, we operate a single, best value pricing policy. “We monitor these prices twice a week against the high street and online, to ensure they remain competitive and have a ‘double the difference’ price promise for added peace of mind. “We await full details of the review and will work closely to offer our full support.” Lewis says prices in airport stores are not cheaper than the high street and the government review should ensure retailers are more transparent about how, and if, savings are being passed on. “Why not pass on the discounts [to individuals travelling outside the EU]? What is so difficult about that? To say it’s complicated is simply balderdash,” Lewis said.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"The Guardian view on Afghanistan: a bad year for Ashraf Ghani", "content": "That the situation in Afghanistan is grim is not exactly news. It has always been dire and remains so. But 2015 has been a very bad year indeed. The Taliban now control more of the country, about 30%, than at any time since 2001 when they were pushed from power by western and Afghan forces after the Twin Towers attacks. Government forces have lost 19,000 dead and injured in the past 12 months. In October, President Barack Obama announced, clearly with a heavy heart, that American soldiers will stay until 2017. And not only stay but, it has become increasingly obvious, stay to fight, not just to train and monitor. The man whose promise had been that he would see all American troops out of both Afghanistan and Iraq by the end of his time in office has been forced to break that promise. The news that some al-Qaida training camps have been established in several parts of the country, as well as the emergence of Islamic State offshoots, underlines the irony. American and other western armies were sent to Afghanistan to make sure it could never again be a haven for those plotting terrorist attacks against the United States and Europe. But now they are back. Yet to simply conclude that it is all just a dismal full circle is probably wrong. Afghanistan is an obstinately fragmented country, divided by ethnicity and religion, and one that has always displayed a pronounced split between its more modern, urbanised side and its rural provinces. Monarchs, Marxists, Islamists and western-style democrats and technocrats have all failed to weld it into anything like a single coherent state. President Ashraf Ghani, its latest leader, has so far achieved few of the things that his impressive qualifications and ideas for development seemed to promise. His “side” is riven by rivalries, quarrels and competitive corruption. His relationship with his partner in power, Abdullah Abdullah, is uneasy, he has still to appoint a full-time minister of defence, and he has recently come under attack from a new opposition council which seems to be mainly a front for the ex-ministers, warlords and businessmen associated with his predecessor, Hamid Karzai. This week he acceded to their demands to hold parliamentary and district elections, which he had earlier postponed, next year. The power struggles on the government side have undermined all its policies, including defence, according to critics. The other side, however, also has its troubles and disputes. The new Taliban commander, Mullah Akhtar Mansour, was recently criticised by religious leaders associated with the movement in Pakistan for his aggressive pursuit of rivals within the movement. The Taliban’s internal splits have given an opening to both Isis and al-Qaida. They may well also be driving the Taliban effort in Helmand, since control of the opium-rich province would hand a major political advantage to whichever leader achieved it. There is perhaps some reason to think that weakness on both sides could be a positive factor. At some point in these chaotic developments peace may look like a real option to elements on the Taliban side, which is why the efforts to revive the peace talks now under way, involving Pakistan, China, and the US, as well as Afghanistan itself, must be welcomed. It has to be said that the prospects are not hopeful, but nor are they entirely hopeless.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Bill Cosby: bail set at $1m during court appearance for sexual assault charges", "content": "Bill Cosby, the comedian and entertainer once known as “America’s dad”, appeared in court to face his first criminal charge for sexual misconduct on Wednesday, for an incident in which he allegedly drugged and violated a woman who considered him to be her mentor. Bill Cosby will finally face charges. There's no guarantee he'll face justice | Jessica Valenti Read more In a hearing lasting less than 10 minutes, Judge Elizabeth McHugh read out the three second-degree felony charges of aggravated indecent assault. He did not appear visibly moved; when asked if he understood the charges, he replied simply: “Yes.” Bail was set at $1m, of which Cosby will have to pay 10% on Wednesday. Cosby faces up to 10 years in prison for each charge. Cosby, 78, arrived at the Montgomery County district courthouse wearing a black and white cardigan and walking with a cane. He declined to answer questions. From the courthouse, he was transferred to Cheltenham police station for processing. Earlier on Wednesday, Pennsylvania prosecutors had issued an arrest warrant for Cosby, 78, over an incident that happened more than a decade ago. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Kevin Steele, Montgomery County’s first assistant district attorney, said the victim was penetrated without her consent while she was impaired. “There is not a question in terms of pills being provided to her, there’s not a question as to what went on, of the digital penetration,” Steele said. Andrea Constand, who first brought charges against Cosby in 2005, was named as the victim in the affidavit. She had met Cosby through her work at Temple University in Philadelphia and had “what the victim believed to be a sincere friendship”, according to the affidavit filed on Wednesday. By the time their relationship began, Cosby was an American icon, celebrated for his role as Dr Cliff Huxtable in the beloved 1980s sitcom The Cosby Show. Along with being a top-rated, award-winning program, the show was heralded for its groundbreaking depiction of a well-to-do black family. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Bill Cosby’s booking photo. Photograph: Montgomery County district attorney’s office Republican strategist Karl Rove had even claimed on election night 2008 that Cosby had changed racial attitudes in the US so significantly that it paved the way for Barack Obama’s presidency. “It was America’s family,” Rove said of the Cosbys. The so-called Huxtable effect is often disputed, but Cosby told the New York Times in 2008 that his show definitely had an enduring effect on racial views in the US. “I would not be surprised with the comfort level of people looking at a family and not being afraid of them, and not holding them to some strange old thoughts of a nation,” Cosby told the New York Times in November 2008. “It’s what people have done with themselves by watching that show and believing in it.” But dozens of women have since publicly claimed that for decades, Cosby was drugging and violating women. Constand is the first to have these allegations officially supported by a law enforcement body. In a press conference on Wednesday, Gloria Allred, the attorney representing 28 of the women who allege they have been victims of Cosby, said it “was a very good sign” that Steele’s office felt the case against Cosby was strong enough to meet the standard of proof required. “For many of my clients,” Allred said, seeing him be charged “was the best Christmas present they have ever received.” “I’m very happy that [Constand’s] case has received new and close scrutiny,” Allred said. “I know that many of my clients would be willing to testify and we look forward to a just result.” In a statement late on Wednesday, Cosby’s attorney, Monique Pressley, said a sexual assault charge was “unjustified”. “Mr Cosby will be exonerated by a court of law” following a vigorous defense, she said, adding that the charge by the Montgomery County district attorney’s office in Pennsylvania came as no surprise. In the affidavit, Constand said that Cosby made two sexual advances towards her while she was at his home. The third time he made advances, she was under the influence of three pills and wine. Investigators have not been able to determine what type of pills she had consumed. But Constand, who had told Cosby she was stressed and missing sleep, believed they were herbal pills. Shortly after taking them, she became dizzy and nauseous, yet was aware that Cosby was fondling her and penetrating her with his fingers. She told investigators that she felt “frozen and paralyzed”. Bill Cosby criminal complaint The criminal complaint filed against Bill Cosby in Pennsylvania. After the incident, Constand moved back to her native Canada, where she still lives, and left her job with Temple’s women’s basketball team. In January 2005, she filed a complaint against Cosby in Ontario. That was followed by a criminal investigation in Montgomery County. Then district attorney Bruce Castor announced in February that the office would not press charges against Cosby. “I thought, in my gut, that she was telling the truth,” Castor told the Washington Post last year. “I was absolutely certain that she believed that Cosby had taken advantage of her, but there were not enough details.” Constand filed a civil suit in March 2005, which eventually included 13 other women who testified as Jane Does. Constand’s attorneys said in the court filings that the women “were victimized after being conned by the Cosby image”. She settled her suit against Cosby in 2006. These allegations and others failed to gain widespread attention until a video of comedian Hannibal Buress calling Cosby a hypocrite and a rapist during a performance went viral in October 2014. Since then, more than 50 women have come forward with accusations of sexual misconduct against Cosby. Sex abuse lawsuits have also been filed against him in Boston and Los Angeles. In Cosby’s deposition in the Constand case, he admitted to obtaining quaaludes with the intent of giving them to women he wanted to have sex with, but the court documents revealing that information were not made public until July. The judge who unsealed the deposition in July argued that because Cosby was seen as a “public moralist”, his statements met the public interest standard for being released. Pennsylvania prosecutors reopened the case over the summer when this damaging testimony was unsealed and as dozens of other women came forward with similar accusations. Janice Dickinson on Bill Cosby: ‘They can fling all they want at me. I did not consent.’ Read more “Reopening this case was our duty as law enforcement officers,” Steele said at a short press conference on Wednesday. Constand was interviewed again after the investigation was reopened, according to the affidavit. So was her mother, Gianna Constand, who told investigators that in her initial confrontation with Cosby over the telephone, she had told him: “You are a very sick man.” She said Cosby had agreed and repeatedly apologized. Her daughter did not ask for the criminal investigation to be reopened but agreed to cooperate with investigators if necessary. The charges come just before the statute of limitations was set to expire for the case. For many of the other women who have made similar claims against Cosby, the statute of limitations had already expired. After the charges were announced, Constand’s attorney, Dolores Troiani, released a statement, expressing her “utmost confidence” in Steele and his team. “On behalf of our client, Andrea Constand, we wish to express our appreciation to the Montgomery County District Attorney’s Office, the County Detectives and the Cheltenham Police Department for the consideration and courtesy they have shown Andrea during this difficult time,” the statement said. “We have the utmost confidence in Mr Steele, Ms Feden and their team, who have impressed us with their professionalism.” This article was amended on 30 December 2015.

{ "title":"'Mad Alex': Donald Trump letters abuse Scottish ex-first minister", "content": "Donald Trump harangued the former first minister of Scotland as “Mad Alex” and accused him of being on a “march to oblivion” in a series of increasingly angry and eccentric letters about windfarms he claimed were blighting his Scottish golf courses. The correspondence with Alex Salmond, revealed by the Huffington Post after a freedom of information request, demonstrated that Trump’s tone swung wildly between coaxing and threatening as he grew increasingly frustrated with his former ally’s refusal to change his policy on renewable energy. Trump warned Salmond that his dream of Scottish independence would be “gone with the wind” if he continued to support windfarm developments, accusing the then leader of the Scottish National party of being “hellbent” on damaging Scotland’s coastline. In 16 published letters, only one of which Salmond replied to, Trump went on to insist that his own motives were to “save Scotland” and “honour my mother”, who was born on the Isle of Lewis before emigrating to the US in her early 20s. Referring to windfarms as “monsters”, the series of letters suggests Salmond “let them ruin the coastline of Sweden first”, declaring that “wind power doesn’t work” and warning him that “your economy will become a third world wasteland that investors will avoid”. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Alex Salmond, the former Scottish first minister. Photograph: Matthew Horwood/Getty Images Trump has been involved in a long-running conflict with the Scottish government over the impact of windfarms on his Scottish golf courses. Salmond supported Trump’s £750m development of the Menie golf resort in Aberdeenshire after planning permission was refused by Aberdeenshire council because of the potential impact on a legally protected coastal nature reserve. But the pair fell out after Trump lodged repeated legal challenges to an offshore windfarm being built in the North Sea, several miles off the Aberdeenshire links course and backed by Salmond. Last December, Trump lost his appeal against the turbines at the supreme court. It prompted an extraordinary war of words between the billionaire and Salmond, who said Trump was “three times a loser”, while the Trump Organisation hit back at the former SNP leader as a “has-been”. A spokesperson for Salmond confirmed on Wednesday that the communications were genuine, adding: “They show a Scottish first minister steadfastly refusing to bow to extreme pressure from Mr Trump in opposition to wind energy. “We can only hope that the responsibilities of office change a man and that the president-elect comes to see the benefits of renewable energy, not only to the environment but to local businesses and communities.” The letters, dated from September 2011 to June 2013, show the billionaire fulminating at the consequences of windfarm development, as well as displaying a rather partial grasp of Scottish history: “The people of Scotland will forever suffer! With the reckless installation of these monsters, you will single-handedly have done more damage to Scotland than virtually any event in Scottish history!” “You seem hellbent on destroying Scotland’s coastline and therefore Scotland itself,” he wrote on 9 February 2012. “But I will never be ‘on board’, as you have stated I would be, with this insanity. As a matter of fact, I have just authorised my staff to allocate a substantial amount of money to launch an international campaign to fight your plan to surround Scotland’s coast with many thousands of wind turbines – it will be like looking through the bars of a prison and the Scottish citizens will be the prisoners!” In another epistle, this time addressed to Philip Hammond, Trump thanked the then defence secretary for “your ongoing objection to these horrendous machines that will ruin Scotland and compromise the United Kingdom’s air defence program”. He concluded: “The defence of the UK is far too important to tinker with just to satisfy Alex Salmond’s bloated ego.” Earlier this year, Salmond urged Americans not to vote for Trump, claiming he had a “bullying” nature that made him unfit to be US president, and revealing for the first time what he described as “green ink” letters that were sent by courier across the Atlantic. Trump’s business interests span the globe and entangle him with numerous foreign governments but he has refused to release his tax returns to give a clearer picture. Last month, he used a meeting with the former Ukip leader, Nigel Farage, and other Brexit supporters to encourage them to oppose windfarms that he argued would spoil the view from one of his golf courses in Scotland. At another meeting with Silicon Valley tech leaders at Trump Tower, three of his children, who will manage his companies during his time in office, were present, while Trump-branded water was served. Trump also met his Indian business partners and posed for pictures with them while the Philippines government announced it was appointing his business partner in Manila as its next ambassador to Washington. A day after he spoke to Argentina’s president, Mauricio Macri, Trump’s Argentinian associate confidently predicted that construction would start next year on the planned Trump Tower Buenos Aires, despite zoning restrictions that have held it back.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"The Guardian view on human habits: not living in the machine age", "content": "Few things are more traditional in the run-up to Christmas than the shopping for and purchase of gifts. These days, however, instead of traipsing around the high street shoppers are increasingly surfing the web for presents. Surveys suggest that e-commerce accounts for more than a quarter of the £80bn spent by British shoppers in the holiday season. The world seems to move ever more online – human life appears often an appendage to a dimly lit screen, with only the bobbing of a head attached wirelessly to a tiny phone to denote conscious thought. But a backlash has begun. Earlier this month more money was spent on vinyl records than on downloaded albums, the first reversal of fortune for such technology. In America the biggest-selling purely audio device is now the humble turntable. This year in the UK, sales of printed books grew for the first time in four years – while ebooks suffered their first ever decline. Paper notebooks and wipeable whiteboards are favoured by Silicon Valley types. Thanks to Edward Snowden, perhaps, typewriters are enjoying a renaissance. Some of this is simply nostalgia or a form of hipster advertising. One poll revealed that almost half of people who bought a vinyl album last month have yet to listen to it. In other cases the attraction is that the promise of technology – its claim of efficiently delivered inexhaustible plenty – is never quite realised. Sitting rooms become littered with remote controls for televisions, set-top boxes and stereos that are all meant to talk to each other but rarely converse more than to tell you they can’t. When your broadband breaks down, so does your music streaming service. Compare such experiences with the sensuous act of consuming art old-style. The satisfying ping of a typewriter; the drop of a needle on a black spinning disc of vinyl; the rustle of pages in a much-loved book. In an increasingly digital world, where physical objects and experiences are being replaced by virtual ones, it seems the analogue world is the one wreathed in the joy of creating and possessing the tangible. These real-world, direct, lived pleasures are essential to the sense of being human – allowing the mind to connect to hand via the eye and ear in a creative pursuit. This has wider ramifications for a society that buzzes to the sound of an algorithmic whirr. As the American philosopher Eric Hoffer noted: “Nothing so bolsters our self-confidence and reconciles us with ourselves as the continuous ability to create; to see things grow and develop under our hand, day in, day out.” Hoffer, perspicaciously perhaps, noted that the decline of the “creative flow within” made the individual frustrated and increasingly susceptible to mass movements. The best of technology recognises that humans gain greatly from learning from the corporeal in a less efficient, less perfect, less speedy manner than machines are designed to do. For typical youngsters, modern computers have become too complicated to learn anything from. Yet teenagers love Raspberry Pi, a piece of cheap, programmable hardware, which allows them to hone their skills. The more time we spend in the digital world of swipes, the more we hanker for face-to-face opportunities.

{ "title":"Libraries are dying – but it’s not about the books", "content": "Public libraries have had another bad year. They are like churches and local railways. People like having them around, and are angry if they close. But as for using them, well, there is so little time these days. The latest Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy figures on library closures are dire. In the past five years 343 have gone. Librarian numbers are down by a quarter, with 8,000 jobs lost. Public usage has fallen by 16% and spending by 14%. Book borrowing is plummeting, in some places by a half. The admirable children’s laureate (and cartoonist) Chris Riddell said during the latest campaign for libraries in November that, “if nurtured by government, they have the ability to transform lives. We must all raise our voices to defend them.” But what sort of library are we defending? I’m not sure the fault in this lies with that easy target, the government, nor even in the once-gloomy fate of the book. Last week I was in my excellent local library and it was near empty. The adjacent Waterstones was bursting at the seams. I know it was Christmas, but something tells me there is a problem with libraries, not with books. When an institution needs a luvvie-march to survive, it looks doomed. Public library loans show dramatic fall in last two years Read more I was a library addict. I grew up mooching along the shelves of my local branch, feeding on its fantasies of biography, travel and self-help. I was terrified alike of the bespectacled librarian and the tramp behind the Times. When I found vinyls and CDs could be borrowed for free, I was over the moon. But I felt as the Victorians did of library fiction. Should so much pleasure be offered “on the rates”? The story of the library is the most exhilarating in modern culture. To the US historian Matthew Battles it is a metaphor for the land of opportunity, a place where, “lost in the stacks”, new Americans could “dream of personal success, unaided by unnamed others, a stage with a mirror for backdrop that reflects only the reader”. In Britain, the library was a grammar school without an 11-plus, a teach-yourself academy, a democracy of learning. The most exciting book on my shelf is Great Libraries of the World (the finest being in Portugal’s Coimbra). One day I shall try to see them all. Battle admits digitisation has changed everything. The public library is no longer a church sacred to knowledge. Its walls have been blasted open, its uniqueness gone. It cannot live in a romantic past, a place where books go to die. Nor need it. So much rubbish is said and written about the death of books. Five years ago, when Amazon ebook sales overtook those of paperback copies, it was assumed the book was doomed. Print was yesterday, one more victim of the great digital wipeout. I have an entire file of obituaries of the book. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Watch 52,000 books reshelved in two minutes at New York public library – timelapse video In the event, as with most over-hyped innovations, ebooks have found a sound place in the market, but hardly a prominent one. Waterstones last year stopped selling Kindles and switched the shelf space to books. It saw a 5% rise in sales. After years on a plateau, physical book sales have begun to rise again, from £2.74bn in 2014 to £2.76bn in 2015. Though the bookshop has suffered, the book has not. But these are buyers, not borrowers. The library must rediscover its specialness. This must lie in exploiting the strength of the post-digital age, the “age of live”. This strength lies not in books as such, but in its readers, in their desire to congregate, share with each other, hear writers and experience books in the context of their community. Beyond the realm of the digital oligarchs, the big money now is in live. It is in plays, concerts, comedy, lectures, debates, gigs, quizzes, performance of every sort. London must have more live events today than ever in history. Who would have dreamed that retiring politicians would grow rich not on banking but on public speaking? The local library needs to become that place of congregation. It should combine coffee shop, book exchange, playgroup, art gallery, museum and performance. It must be the therapist of the mind. It must be what medieval churches once were. Books are back. Only the technodazzled thought they would go away | Simon Jenkins Read more Indeed the decline of libraries has a similar trajectory to that of churches, thousands of which now lie actually or virtually unused in villages and towns across the land. They too have underused buildings and underused books. Like libraries, they must turn to communal nostalgia for support. Libraries and churches have a shared metaphysic. They embody the cultural identity of a place as its archive, museum and collective memory. I remember once visiting Blickling church in Norfolk during a festival. Some inspired individual had asked every local organisation, from the Scouts to the lifeboat to the second-hand bookshop, to display its wares in an aisle bay. The place was packed. It was a virtual high street. There was even room in the chancel for choir practice. Since redundant churches are prominent buildings, and most cannot be demolished, they offer the perfect venue for the new library as cultural hub. In some cases, churches are already being used as one-stop refuges for high streets in decline, from post offices and corner shops to nursery schools and clinics. But churches are best suited to be a community’s cultural exchange. Where deconsecrated, there is no reason to see them as places of sectarian religion. They should be for everyone. Ailing libraries and churches should merge. They should be removed from their present owners and managers, and be vested in neighbourhood parish and town councils, as is common on the continent. These councils should have power to levy a local tax (with voluntary opt-out) for their support. There will be thrills and spills, but local responsibility is the only secure way forward – and it would raise money. Ever since the days of Alexandria, the library has been the palace of the mind, the University of All. The internet has removed its monopoly on knowledge, but cannot replicate its sense of place, its joy of human congregation. The Victorian tycoon Andrew Carnegie, first great patron of public libraries in Britain and America, dreamed of one in every town and village. His vision awaits renaissance.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Funfairs left with fewer new rides by trade body rules, CMA says", "content": "Restrictive practices by the trade body representing owners of fairground rides has left funfairs with fewer new attractions, the competition regulator has claimed. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said on Wednesday that the law may have been breached by rules enforced by a trade body in the travelling fair sector, the Showmen’s Guild of Great Britain. Ann Pope, a senior antitrust director at the CMA, said: “These allegations concern the use of restrictive rules which could limit competition between funfairs and effectively prevent non-guild members from being able to compete. “Fair-goers may lose out if new fairs can’t take place or if existing fairs are under less competitive pressure to provide different or new attractions.” The CMA said guild members made up 90% of the travelling fairs sector in the UK, a market estimated to be worth £100m a year. The regulator claims that the body’s rules and practices prevent competition in organising or attending fairs, and may also stop members from starting new fairs in competition with existing events. Fairs tend to be staged at the request of local authorities, who ask an organiser to arrange to supply the attractions. The organisers tend to be guild members, who then widely use guild members to provide the rides. The CMA alleges that even in cases where local authorities try to alter or improve a fair without the consent of the guild, “its members can boycott the whole fair as a result of the rules as happened in Newcastle in 2013 which meant the Hoppings Fair did not go ahead, leading to around half a million fair-goers who usually attend missing out”. The Showmen’s Guild of Great Britain declined to comment on the CMA’s statement or explain what it does to look after its members’ interests. However, the body’s website says it protects “the interests of its members ... by its code of rules for members and through the legal and constitutional processes of the land. “Through its parliamentary agent, the guild contests any proposed legislation that discriminates against its members; or seeks concessions when legislation threatens their ability to make a living. In matters involving local authorities a delegation of officers will usually be called upon to represent member’s interests.” The CMA added: “These are provisional findings only and no conclusion can be drawn at this stage that there has been a breach of competition law. We will carefully consider any representations before deciding whether the law has been broken.” The 1998 Competition Act prohibits “agreements, practices and conduct that may have a damaging effect on competition” in the UK and covers “anti-competitive agreements, decisions by associations and concerted practices between businesses which have as their object or effect the prevention, restriction or distortion of competition within the UK and which may affect trade within the UK”. Any business found to have infringed that section of the legislation can be fined up to 10% of its annual worldwide group turnover, the CMA said.",diasaster:0},

Putin on Wednesday demanded new regulations be put in place to tighten controls over the production and sale of liquids including perfume, cleaning fluids, medicines and cosmetics that contain more than 25% alcohol. He also told the government to look at increasing the legal consequences for violations in the production and sale of these items. The death toll in the Siberian city of Irkutsk over recent days has now reached 62. Investigators on Monday said they had discovered an underground laboratory in the city making fake boyaryshnik, a tincture supposedly meant to be added to baths for relaxation. The fluid, which normally contains 93% ethanol, as well as hawthorn extract and lemon oil, is widely drunk in Russia as a cheap substitute for alcohol. Siberian city declares emergency as dozens die from drinking alcoholic bath tincture Read more However, police found that the batch in Irkutsk contained methanol, a poisonous substance found in antifreeze, instead of ethanol. Local authorities declared a state of emergency in Irkutsk on Monday, and across the wider region on Tuesday. Police seized thousands of bottles of the liquid from shops and kiosks across the region, and authorities ordered a temporary ban on the sale of all fluids containing alcohol. Twelve people have been arrested for distributing the fake batch, and courts in Irkutsk remanded them in custody on Wednesday. According to Irkutsk region’s ministry of health, 107 people have been poisoned by the batch of fake boyaryshnik, with 62 dead so far. Around half of them died in hospital, while others were already dead on arrival. There are still 36 people in hospital. Four people have been released having made what local doctors called a “miracle recovery”. There are two main problems in Russia’s surrogate alcohol market: first is the widespread consumption of items marked as perfumes or bath tinctures. They are exempt from sales restrictions and taxes that normal alcoholic drinks would carry but are often sold at drinks kiosks where it is obvious people would purchase them for consumption. In one Russian region, automated street machines selling Boyaryshnik were installed earlier this year. The second problem is fake alcohol: there have been numerous cases of underground factories making cheap vodka or whisky and attaching fake labels to the bottles. In Irkutsk, both problems combined to lethal effect, as dozens died from ingesting a tainted version of something that was in any case not designed as a drink. The Irkutsk tragedy is an extreme example, but deaths from drinking low-quality alcohol are common. Russia’s consumer watchdog said that during the first nine months of 2016, 9,300 Russians died from alcohol poisoning.

{ "title":"The Party of the Brazilian Woman is not actually a women's political party", "content": "In a country with one of the world’s highest levels of violence against women, an average 40% pay gap between the sexes, and a congress in which just one in 10 are female, the foundation of a new political party dedicated to the promotion of women in public life seems like a welcome development. Despite its name, however, the Partido da Mulher Brasileira (PMB), or Party of the Brazilian Woman, is at pains to clarify that it is not a feminist organisation. It is firmly against abortion, and only two of its 20 federal deputies are female. “Obviously we want to attract more women,” said the party’s founder and president, Suêd Haidar, 59. “That’s something we are working really hard to do.” Facebook Twitter Pinterest Sued Haidar of the Partido da Mulher Brasileira. Photograph: PMB With just 53 women in its 513-seat congress, Brazil ranks 115th in the world in terms of female representation in politics, according to the Inter-Parliamentary Union, behind numerous nations with a questionable commitment to women’s rights, such as Saudi Arabia and Somalia. In President Dilma Rousseff’s 31-member cabinet, there are only four women, while the president herself, Brazil’s first female head of state, is currently battling impeachment proceedings. Haidar began her political education by following her mother to rallies in the working-class neighbourhoods of São Luís, the capital of the poor north-eastern state of Maranhão. At age 16, she moved to Rio de Janeiro with her new husband and a one-month-old baby, working as a maid, a seamstress and a beautician but always participating in the city’s leftwing politics in her free time. In 2008, she gathered together her three children and her husband to announce plans to sell her five food stores to finance the creation of the PMB. Since then, she has spent seven years travelling the country to gather the 500,000 signatures necessary to register the party. “Brazilian women play an active role in the organization of political parties, but when it comes to deciding who will actually be in power, women are always left out,” Haidar said. As with many Latin American countries, Brazilian party politics uses a system of proportional representation and gender quotas. But Brazil operates an open-list system, in which voters, rather than the party, pick the candidates. As there is no placement mechanism for the candidates, men tend to dominate the top of the list, attracting the lion’s share of campaign funding and, consequently, the electorate’s attention. Argentina, by contrast, uses a closed-list PR system, in which every third candidate must be female. Sanctions against parties that fail to comply with the gender quotas are severe. As a result, around 40% of the Argentine congress is female. Earlier this year, an attempt to establish quotas in parliament passed in Brazil’s senate, where 16% of the chamber is female, but foundered in the lower house. “I think the lack of women in Brazilian politics is representative of the gender inequality as a whole in the country,” said Luciana Ramos, a professor of law at the Fundação Getulio Vargas in São Paulo. “The media gives the impression that the role of Brazilian women in society is improving, but if you look at the details I don’t think that’s true.” A survey published earlier this year by the Washington-based research group Corporate Women Directors International found that women held just 6.3% of the seats on the board of directors of Brazil’s largest companies. Data from IBGE, the government’s official statistics agency, show that Brazilian women earn, on average, 40.5% less than their male counterparts. In the UK, that figure is 19.7%. Brazil is also one of the most dangerous countries in the world for women. The total number of female homicide victims in Brazil increased by 252% between 1980 and 2013. Its murder rate of 4.8 female homicides per 100,000 people is 48 times higher than the US. Facebook Twitter Pinterest During morning and evening rush hours in Rio de Janeiro, special subway cars exclusively for women are provided for their safety and against molestation. Photograph: Viviane Moos/Corbis At present, the PMB’s plans to tackle these issues are somewhat vague, with its website promising an approach “between capitalism and socialism, with a greater tendency towards socialism.” Haidar, who plans to run for congress in 2018, promises further definition in due course. So far, the PMB has attracted a curious mix of evangelicals, security hardliners and old-fashioned leftists disenchanted with their old political parties. Skeptics suggest its new adherents are motivated more by the prospect of campaign financing ahead of next year’s municipal elections or fear of expulsion from their current parties, rather than women’s rights. Earlier this month the party gained its first senator when Hélio José, who was forced out of the ruling Partido dos Trabalhadores (PT) after being accused of sexually abusing his underage niece, declared his allegiance to the PMB. “What would become of us men,” he asked the senate, “if there were no women by our side, to bring us joy and pleasure?” Still, Ramos thinks the existence of the PMB – Brazil’s 35th party, but already the tenth largest in congress – could have a positive impact on the country’s politics. “At least the PMB has a female president, so it is likely to appoint more women,” she said. “All the other political parties are run by men.”",diasaster:0},

The digital economy minister, Ed Vaizey, wants the next generation of tech entrepreneurs to focus on sectors that are largely state-backed. Wherever government is involved as a buyer of services, Vaizey said, it should make the most of new technology. “In education, universities and colleges are already using massive online courses, so lectures and courses can reach a much wider audience, costing less. Could schools benefit from similar innovations?” he said. Deliveroo and Crowdcube join Tech City UK’s rising stars Read more Vaizey said the NHS still relies top-heavily on paper-based bureaucracy and requires further digital innovation “so that our amazing doctors and nurses can spend more time saving lives and improving care”. In a new year message, Vaizey said he wanted to see the digital economy expand its footprint outside London, as he applauded the establishment of tech strongholds beyond the capital. More than 70% of digital businesses in the UK are based outside London, including flight comparison site Skyscanner in Edinburgh and social media monitor Brandwatch in Brighton. When the government set up Tech City in east London in 2010, it helped create a cluster in an area that was close to the City’s financial district but benefited from lower office rental costs compared with the Square Mile. However, critics of the project warned that it focused too closely on London while other parts of the country were being neglected. Now Tech City’s remit is as much about spreading the digital economy throughout the UK as it is about creating national champions, such as Zoopla, the property website and Just Eat, the digital takeaway food group. For instance, Tech North was founded in 2015 to support digital entrepreneurs in the north of England. A recent report from Tech City, entitled Tech Nation, shows that more than six out of 10 employees in the digital economy live outside inner London and that Bournemouth and Liverpool head up the five fastest growing tech clusters. In search of a European Google Read more In the latest list of new joiners to Tech City’s Future Fifty, a programme for companies that represent the sector’s brightest stars, there are several potential high-flying businesses from outside central London. Alongside Skyscanner and Brandwatch, they include Crowdcube, a crowdfunding vehicle from Exeter, and Floow, a Sheffield business that monitors drivers’ behaviour. Clusters of digital activity outside London include Cambridge for hardware, Belfast for cybersecurity and Liverpool for gaming. Key to spreading digital outwards from London is the rollout of superfast broadband. Currently it is available to 90% of the UK but the government’s aim is to extend this to 95% by 2017. Vaizey said the government is planning to give every home and business the legal right to request fast broadband. The UK tech industry has already established a foothold in the world of e-commerce, for example, where its share of retail sales at 11% is higher than in the US, according to a recent report. Alongside healthcare and education, Vaizey now wants UK companies to be at the forefront of experimentation in new digital-inspired businesses, such as driverless cars or drones for the delivery of goods. “How can we make sure the UK is at the cutting edge of these developments?” he said.",diasaster:0},

Hossain, 29, who is considered a hero by many younger Bangladeshis, faces charges carrying a potential 14 years in prison, plus a fine, and has been suspended from all cricket until further notice by the Bangladeshi cricket board. The alleged victim, Mahfuza Akhter, known as Happy, was found in September in a street in Dhaka, the Bangladeshi capital, with multiple injuries, including a broken leg. She told investigators she had been working for the couple for a year. “They used to beat me with sticks, kitchen utensils, punch me, and scratch me. I would be slapped a lot,” Akhter was quoted as saying by CNN, which carried pictures of her swollen and bruised face on the day she was found. Shahadat Hossain's five wickets put Bangladesh on the Lord's board | Vic Marks Read more Police submitted the charges against Hossain and his wife, Nritto Shahadat, to the Dhaka metropolitan magistrates court on Tuesday, under legislation designed to protect women and children from domestic abuse. Both were bailed earlier this month after a brief spell in prison after their arrests in October. They had fled their homes after the initial case was filed, leading police to carry out raids at locations including Hossain’s ancestral village. Hossain was arrested on 5 October, after four weeks on the run, when he turned himself in to police a day after his wife was arrested at her parents’ house in Dhaka. Both were held in custody until courts granted them bail. Akhter was found by a passerby in a street in Mirpur district on 6 September, hours after Hossain filed a police complaint claiming his servant had gone missing, according to Bangladeshi media. She was taken to a hospital, then a police station where she made her allegations against Hossain and his wife. In an interview with CNN, Akhter said she was kept locked in Hossain’s household, forced to sleep in a bathroom and given only leftovers to eat, until she decided to risk a life on the streets rather than continue suffering in domestic bondage. “When the house maid came inside the house, she opened the door. While the door was open, I ran out of the house,” she said. “I was in a lot of pain. While I was walking on the road, people were staring at me. I covered my eye because it was bruised and it was hurting.” Akhter says she does not know where her parents are, and that it was her grandmother who sent her to work in Hossain’s home, because the family needed money. Child labour remains common in Bangladesh with many families relying on the income their children generate for survival, despite a ban on employing anyone under 14 introduced in 2006. That same year, 12.8% – 4.7 million – of the country’s children were employed, according to the UN Children’s Fund. Of those children, 421,000 were domestic workers.

{ "title":"Van Akin Burd obituary", "content": "Van Akin Burd, who has died aged 101, devoted most of his academic career to the study of John Ruskin. The author of around 50 scholarly articles on the Victorian thinker, artist and philanthropist, and the editor of four editions of his writings, Burd was by common consent the towering figure in modern Ruskin studies. In 1951, he took a position at the State University of New York at Cortland, where, despite attractive offers from elsewhere, he remained for his whole career. Perhaps his greatest discovery came one day in the early 1960s when, while reading Ruskin on JMW Turner at the Pierpont Morgan library in New York, Burd happened to consult a collection of letters written by Ruskin for the headteacher and pupils of an experimental school for girls at Winnington in Cheshire. The girls were known to have inspired The Ethics of the Dust (1866), perhaps the strangest book in the Ruskin canon. It dawned on Burd that he had unearthed an unpublished book of Ruskin’s, one that anticipated the modes of inquiry he adopted in much of his later work. Burd’s first Ruskin edition, The Winnington Letters of John Ruskin (1969), was the result, and it was instrumental in initiating a Ruskin revival. In the same year, the scholar James Dearden, with whom Burd would form an enduring friendship, organised a Ruskin conference at Brantwood, the master’s house on the shores of Coniston Water, Cumbria, and were thus brought into contact with a new generation of scholars. Facebook Twitter Pinterest John Ruskin in the 1840s. Photograph: Hulton-Deutsch Collection/Corbis Burd’s next edition was the two-volume Ruskin Family Letters (1973), an intimate record of Ruskin’s formative years. It assembles and annotates the family’s correspondence from the early years of his parents’ long engagement to the launch of Ruskin’s first book, Modern Painters, in 1843. His next subject was Rose La Touche, the young woman to whom Ruskin proposed marriage when she was 18 and he 47. John Ruskin and Rose La Touche (1979) is an edition of Rose’s diary, which for the first time permitted Rose to be heard in her own voice. It provided a new understanding of her character and brought out the depth of Ruskin’s love for her, so often stereotyped and misunderstood. Burd next turned to editing a previously unpublished set of Ruskin’s letters written in Venice in the winter of 1876-77, soon after Rose’s death at the age of 25. Mourning Rose during a time when his own faith was weak, Ruskin was looking for some sign of her continuing spiritual presence. Christmas Story: John Ruskin’s Venetian Letters of 1876-77, appeared in 1990, and in its compelling introduction Burd examines Ruskin’s interest in spiritualism during this troubled period. Burd was born in Miami, Florida, one of three children, and the only son of Melvin, a building contractor, and his wife Elizabeth (nee Van Akin). At the University of Chicago, he developed a love for the work of Turner and the pre-Raphaelite painters. After leaving, he was a schoolteacher for a couple of years, and travelled to Fiji to see where Herman Melville had set his novels. He met Julia Robinson, a teacher, and they married in 1943. He then enlisted in the US navy, and was a member of the force that invaded, and later rebuilt, Okinawa, Japan. On shore assignment during his naval service he read Proust, and it was the latter’s interest in art, architecture and Venice in particular that led Burd to the novelist’s passion for Ruskin. Proust and Ruskin were to be the joint subjects of his thesis when in 1945 he embarked on his PhD at the University of Michigan, but his supervisor urged him to focus on Ruskin alone: “Everybody’s doing Proust these days,” he was told, “but no one’s doing Ruskin.” Ruskin’s reputation had fallen into steep decline in the years following the first world war. Burd ended up writing his thesis on Ruskin and Turner. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Detail of a watercolour of Mount Pilatus, Switzerland, by John Ruskin, 1854. Photograph: DEA Picture Library/De Agostini/Getty Images Burd was a keen traveller. As a frequent visitor to the UK he became a companion of the Guild of St George, the utopian charity founded by Ruskin in 1871. His energy was prodigious and at least two of his visits, in the company of his friend the Ruskin scholar James L Spates, were made during his 90s. In that decade he published six new papers on Ruskin, the last in his 100th year. In a 2012 interview, Spates asked Burd if, after 70 years spent working on Ruskin, he had any regrets. He replied: “There are things I’d like to have done and there are things I’d still like to do, but, to tell the truth, I’ve no regrets. I’ve lived a magic life.” His kindness and approachability were legendary among his fellow scholars. Julia died in 2000.

A Downing Street spokesman said: “The safety and security of British citizens is the government’s number one priority. Clearly in the light of what has happened in Berlin, police will be reviewing what is in place.” Theresa May sent a message of condolence to the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, on Monday night. “She expressed that her thoughts are with the people of Berlin and we stand ready to assist in any way we can,” a spokesman said. Greater Manchester police said they had strengthened their presence at Christmas markets across the city. Scotland Yard said an attack with a large vehicle had already been considered as a possible scenario prior to the Berlin lorry attack.

The Met also said it would it be bringing forward enhanced security measures for the Changing the Guard at Buckingham Palace, with the ceremony set to take place on Thursday and then again on Christmas Eve. The Met said it would be implementing road closures during the ceremonies. Large numbers of people will be in London around the festive period as post-Christmas sales start, while more than 100,000 revellers are expected to attend the New Year’s Eve fireworks display on the banks of the Thames. The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, sought to reassure Londoners and visitors that the Met would review its security plans in light of Monday night’s events. “Keeping everyone safe remains the highest priority for the Met commissioner and for me,” he said. Khan added: “My thoughts and prayers are with everyone affected by the awful suspected attack on Berlin last night, particularly those who were injured, the families and friends of those who were killed and all the emergency responders. “We don’t yet have the full details, but this appears to have been a horrific and cowardly act of terror.

So-called “hostile vehicle mitigation measures” have been in place for several years. The threat to Christmas events and shoppers is seen by UK counter-terrorism officials as part of the severe threat level Britain faces. Nothing seen so far in Isis propaganda, which has inspired previous attacks, has urged plots targeting Christmas events. But there are calls for attacks against westerners at any time of the year. Counter-terrorism officials believe an attack against the UK is highly likely, in keeping with the current threat level. They are understood to be tracking and investigating plots they fear may be attempts to cause mass casualties in Britain. In Manchester, police said they had strengthened their presence at the city’s Christmas markets, which have almost 350 stalls spread across 10 sites. Assistant chief constable Debbie Ford said police already had a visible operation in place around the markets and in other key areas. She said: “We will be working in line with the national response and have strengthened our policing presence at the Manchester Christmas markets and stepped up visible patrols, to ensure that people feel safe to go about their daily lives. “I would like to stress at this point that there is absolutely no information or intelligence suggesting any attack is imminent in Greater Manchester.” Dave Thompson, chief constable of West Midlands police, tweeted: Dave Thompson (@DaveThompsonCC) Terrible events in #Berlin last night. We always review events carefully to assess the protection we have in place for our communities.

It is estimated that 5.5 million people will visit the market before it closes on 29 December. A West Midlands police spokesman said: “A number of security measures were agreed before the market opened, including installing some concrete bollards at a number of locations.” Supt Andy Parsons said the bollards were part of the original security plan and not a result of any specific intelligence. “It is a busy time of year for the city and we want to ensure a safe and enjoyable time for everyone who visits over the festive period,” he said. “Our policing tactics and security measures are constantly reviewed and we, along with our partners, are working around the clock to keep our cities as safe as can be.” Facebook Twitter Pinterest The German market in Bimingham city centre.

This month Northumbria police were criticised by shoppers for the presence of armed officers at Newcastle’s Christmas market. Visitors complained on social media that officers with guns should not be at an event with so many children. Nic King wrote on Facebook: “I don’t want to see guns the size of my child when Christmas shopping and these images have put me off going into Newcastle.” Northumbria police said the armed officers served to reassure the public. Police Scotland said their plans were being assessed after the events in Berlin.

{ "title":"Celebrity isn’t just harmless fun – it’s the smiling face of the corporate machine", "content": "Now that a reality TV star is preparing to become president of the United States, can we agree that celebrity culture is more than just harmless fun – that it might, in fact, be an essential component of the systems that govern our lives? The rise of celebrity culture did not happen by itself. It has long been cultivated by advertisers, marketers and the media. And it has a function. The more distant and impersonal corporations become, the more they rely on other people’s faces to connect them to their customers. Corporation means body; capital means head. But corporate capital has neither head nor body. It is hard for people to attach themselves to a homogenised franchise owned by a hedge fund whose corporate identity consists of a filing cabinet in Panama City. So the machine needs a mask. It must wear the face of someone we see as often as we see our next-door neighbours. It is pointless to ask what Kim Kardashian does to earn her living: her role is to exist in our minds. By playing our virtual neighbour, she induces a click of recognition on behalf of whatever grey monolith sits behind her this week. Tim Cook on why he met Donald Trump and the future of desktop Macs Read more An obsession with celebrity does not lie quietly beside the other things we value; it takes their place. A study published in the journal Cyberpsychology reveals that an extraordinary shift appears to have taken place between 1997 and 2007 in the US. In 1997, the dominant values (as judged by an adult audience) expressed by the shows most popular among nine- to 11 year-olds were community feeling, followed by benevolence. Fame came 15th out of the 16 values tested. By 2007, when shows such as Hannah Montana prevailed, fame came first, followed by achievement, image, popularity and financial success. Community feeling had fallen to 11th, benevolence to 12th. A paper in the International Journal of Cultural Studies found that, among the people it surveyed in the UK, those who follow celebrity gossip most closely are three times less likely than people interested in other forms of news to be involved in local organisations, and half as likely to volunteer. Virtual neighbours replace real ones. The blander and more homogenised the product, the more distinctive the mask it needs to wear. This is why Iggy Pop was used to promote motor insurance and Benicio del Toro is used to sell Heineken. The role of such people is to suggest that there is something more exciting behind the logo than office blocks and spreadsheets. They transfer their edginess to the company they represent. As soon they take the cheque that buys their identity, they become as processed and meaningless as the item they are promoting. The principal qualities now sought in a celebrity are vapidity, vacuity and physical beauty The celebrities you see most often are the most lucrative products, extruded through a willing media by a marketing industry whose power no one seeks to check. This is why actors and models now receive such disproportionate attention, capturing much of the space once occupied by people with their own ideas: their expertise lies in channelling other people’s visions. A database search by the anthropologist Grant McCracken reveals that in the US actors received 17% of the cultural attention accorded to famous people between 1900 and 1910: slightly less than physicists, chemists and biologists combined. Film directors received 6% and writers 11%. Between 1900 and 1950, actors had 24% of the coverage, and writers 9%. By 2010, actors accounted for 37% (over four times the attention natural scientists received), while the proportion allocated to both film directors and writers fell to 3%. You don’t have to read or watch many interviews to see that the principal qualities now sought in a celebrity are vapidity, vacuity and physical beauty. They can be used as a blank screen on to which anything can be projected. With a few exceptions, those who have least to say are granted the greatest number of platforms on which to say it. This helps to explain the mass delusion among young people that they have a reasonable chance of becoming famous. A survey of 16-year-olds in the UK revealed that 54% of them intend to become celebrities. As soon as celebrities forget their allotted role, the hounds of hell are let loose upon them. Lily Allen was the media’s darling when she was advertising John Lewis. Gary Lineker couldn’t put a foot wrong when he stuck to selling junk food to children. But when they expressed sympathy for refugees, they were torn to shreds. When you take the corporate shilling, you are supposed to stop thinking for yourself. Celebrity has a second major role: as a weapon of mass distraction. The survey published in the IJCS I mentioned earlier also reveals that people who are the most interested in celebrity are the least engaged in politics, the least likely to protest and the least likely to vote. This appears to shatter the media’s frequent, self-justifying claim that celebrities connect us to public life. ​Khizr Khan on being vilified by Trump: 'The far right feels that their voice has been heard' Read more The survey found that people fixated by celebrity watch the news on average as much as others do, but they appear to exist in a state of permanent diversion. If you want people to remain quiescent and unengaged, show them the faces of Taylor Swift, Shia LaBeouf and Cara Delevingne several times a day. In Trump we see a perfect fusion of the two main uses of celebrity culture: corporate personification and mass distraction. His celebrity became a mask for his own chaotic, outsourced and unscrupulous business empire. His public image was the perfect inversion of everything he and his companies represent. As presenter of the US version of The Apprentice, this spoilt heir to humongous wealth became the face of enterprise and social mobility. During the presidential elections, his noisy persona distracted people from the intellectual void behind the mask, a void now filled by more lucid representatives of global capital. Celebrities might inhabit your life, but they are not your friends. Regardless of the intentions of those on whom it is bequeathed, celebrity is the lieutenant of exploitation.

When one considers these latest plans alongside the disastrous higher education and research bill, which would expand for-profit education and undermine university autonomy, it is almost as if this government is determined to destroy one of the few world-beating sectors this country still has. Sally Hunt General secretary, University and College Union • Rumours regarding international education are harmful; the latest ONS statistics reveal the number of people immigrating to study fell by 15.5% this year to 163,000, the lowest estimate since 2007, over which period the global market demand has grown by 60% – a massive missed opportunity for the UK that is the result of damaging policy and rhetoric. International students not only support our universities, they also contribute to our soft power: one in seven countries has a leader who studied in the UK. It would be utter folly for the Home Office to pursue an unjustified and arbitrary crackdown on student visas: an unpublished Home Office report allegedly revealed that only 1% of international students overstay their visas, rather than the 100,000 suggested by ONS data, so it seems likely that they are net neutral to net migration numbers and certainly not the “immigrants” that certain elements of the government seem to like to portray them as. James Pitman Managing director, HE – UK and Europe, Study Group • For some years, while taking student lodgers, we have encountered a number of interesting, industrious and very friendly graduate students – several from Thailand and occasional ones from Taiwan, China, Japan, Iraq and even Kazakhstan. The young women have studied astrophysics, tax harmonisation, the influence of family firms, intellectual property law but also the social context of Taiwanese pop music. The men, education skills, Thai xylophone bands, but also landslides. A lot of the time the house has smelled like a superior Thai restaurant. We are sad that Amber Rudd thinks this country would be a better place if half of these people (who incidentally pay far higher fees than native students) could be kept away by erecting quotas, persuading them that they would be better off studying at home, or inventing questionnaires with trick questions. (She could always send vans around with threatening inscriptions.) Does she think foreign tourists should be discouraged? Certainly, the more closely we approximate to North Korea, the more in control we shall feel. Joyce and George Schlesinger Durham • Courses offering opportunities to UK students would not run without the presence of international students, especially at postgraduate level. The current policy reflects a totally uncoordinated approach on the part of government. Why spend millions on marketing UK education overseas at the same time as attempting to drive down the number of student visas? The solution to reduce overall immigration figures is so simple: remove students from the migration statistics and place them in a separate classification in the same way that many of our competitors do. Net migration figures would be reduced at a stroke at the same time as preserving a major contributor to the UK’s economy. David Cronin Stockport, Cheshire • What the government should be doing is to evaluate Britain’s economic strengths in order to provide a Brexit parachute, and three obvious areas are education, research and the arts. In 2008-09, tuition fee income to the UK from foreign students was worth over £4bn, and 18% of the £26.4bn spent on research and development in the UK in 2010 came from overseas (£4.8bn). The UK’s creative industries are now worth £84.1bn per year to the UK economy, or almost £10m per hour. Why therefore limit the number of foreign students who can come to the UK and cut back on arts education in schools and colleges? We need a quick and entirely objective reappraisal of government policy in these areas, for purely economic reasons if nothing else. Dr Richard Turner Harrogate, North Yorkshire • Surely the typical overseas student comes to the UK to study for three or four years and then goes home again. I do not see therefore why slashing their numbers would make any difference (other than temporary and cosmetic) to net immigration figures, for in any given year new students coming are cancelled out by old students going.

{ "title":"Lozzuck brings delight to this dialectologist", "content": "I was delighted to read Rosie Irvine’s letter (19 December) describing her father’s use of “lozzerk” in the sense of “lounging together as a family in front of the television”. I hope Rosie will be equally delighted to know that her word is recorded in the magnificent English Dialect Dictionary – an extraordinarily comprehensive six-volume collection of 19th-century British regional vocabulary edited by Joseph Wright and published between 1898 and 1905. Wright lists various spellings, which he combines in a single entry at “lozzuck”, defining it as “to lounge; to loll; to idle; to chatter”. The entry records that “lozzuck” was (probably still is) restricted to Lancashire, Cheshire, Staffordshire and Shropshire, which ties in perfectly with Rosie’s description. As a dialectologist, it’s always a pleasure to see evidence – of which there is plenty, despite frequent and exaggerated reports to the contrary – of the endurance of local dialect. The Evolving English WordBank, created by visitors to the British Library’s Evolving English exhibition, confirms this continued diversity and, like Wright’s great dictionary, is the result of contributions submitted enthusiastically by members of the public aware of the importance of vernacular speech to our sense of individual and shared identities. Jonnie Robinson British Library • I wonder if there are regional variations of lozzerking? My mother, a Cheshire (Northwich) woman, always used it as a term of censure. (“How can you say you’re tired when you’ve spent the whole day lozzacking on the sofa?” “Stop lozzacking and do something useful for a change.”) My two cousins – daughters of two of my mother’s sisters – were able to confirm this interpretation. And no, we didn’t need lighted candles, nor hand-knitted socks, to lozzack. Though a thick jumper or two was always handy in those pre-central heating days.

{ "title":"Lloyds snaps up MBNA for £1.9bn", "content": "Lloyds Banking Group is to spend £1.9bn on MBNA, a credit card business owned by Bank of America, as the bailed-out lender continues its recovery from the financial crisis. The UK bank’s first major acquisition since its £20bn rescue by the taxpayer during the 2008 crisis will give it a 26% share of the credit card market and allow it to produce £100m annual savings within two years. Lloyds, 7% owned by the taxpayer, would not comment on the implications for the workforces of the two operations, which employ a combined 2,700 in Chester. MBNA – one of the UK’s largest credit card issuers, with 7 million customers including its own brands and the official cards of several major football clubs – has been on the market for some time. Lloyds had been battling against US private equity group Cerberus, HSBC and Santander UK for the operation. A firewall against claims for payment protection insurance (PPI) was thought to be crucial in securing the deal. The misselling scandal has already cost Lloyds £17bn – more than any other bank – and Lloyds said its exposure to MBNA’s bill was capped at £240m, indicating Bank of America will pick up the tab for anything above that threshold. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Lloyds Banking Group market shares Photograph: LLoyds Banking Group Lloyds Bank pays £1.9bn for MBNA, while Bank of Japan holds interest rates - business live Read more The deal is expected to complete in the first six months of 2017, during which time the government is expected to sell the last of its shares in Lloyds. Lloyds was the biggest riser on the FTSE 100 by mid-afternoon, up about 2.5% to 64p. The government is selling off its remaining stake at prices below the 76.3p average price at which taxpayers paid to take a 43% stake during the crisis. António Horta-Osório, the Lloyds chief executive, said the MBNA name would be retained as part of the bank’s multi-brand strategy. Among its brands are Halifax, Bank of Scotland and car finance lender Black Horse. It also, he said, “advances our strategic aim to deliver sustainable growth as a UK-focused retail and commercial bank”. Lloyds paid for the business out of its reserves, which sparked some concerns that it might not be able to pay a special dividend to shareholders. The bank insisted its payout policy was not altered. “Nothing has changed,” said George Culmer, Lloyds’ finance director. The transaction further focuses Lloyds on the domestic market at time when the UK is preparing to exit the EU. Joseph Dickerson, a banking analyst at Jefferies, said the deal was “a very good use” of Lloyds’ excess capital and that the terms looked attractive. Dickerson said that a special dividend “is now unlikely but the MBNA acquisition looks a better use of excess to us”. The deal will increase Lloyds’ market share of credit cards from 15% to 26%, making it second only to Barclaycard in terms of size. Culmer acknowledged the deal was subject to competition approval but he said a recent study had found the credit card market was “healthy and competitive”. The bank has a 25% share of current accounts, 22% of retail deposits and 21% of mortgages.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"'It was terrifying': Berlin market attack witnesses describe carnage", "content": "The Christmas market on Berlin’s Breitscheidplatz is normally a place of fun. Under the shadow of the Kaiser Wilhelm memorial church – bombed in 1943 and now a ghostly, jagged ruin – tourists and locals gather. Next door is the Zoological Garden, a rambling expanse of green popular with joggers, families and lovers. On Monday at 8pm, the scene was festive. Dozens of people were visiting the square. Some were strolling; others were perched on green-painted wooden tables in the shape of Christmas trees, chatting. On either side of a pedestrian alley, stalls sold mulled wine, beer and bratwurst. For children there was hot chocolate and crepes. From the direction of Kantstrasse, a Scania articulated lorry came into view. According to witnesses, its headlights were off. Instead of continuing down Budapester Strasse – its logical route – it veered off the road and plunged into the market. What we know so far about the Berlin Christmas market attack Read more The lorry smashed through the middle of the alley, killing several people instantly and sending others sprawling. It continued for about 50 metres, smashing through a wooden booth and careening leftwards back into Budapester Strasse before it came to a halt. The attack lasted a few seconds. Lana Sefovac, a Bosnian who lives in Berlin, was at the entrance of the market drinking mulled wine with his family when the vehicle – grey-painted and with Polish number plates – bore down upon him. “I was standing in front of the stall. My father was in front of me. My mum was behind,” he said. “I heard a very, very loud noise and when I turned towards it, the first thing I saw was wood flying all around because he literally smashed the first wooden booth by driving very fast. “He was driving directly toward us, directly into us. But then he made a turn because he did not want to drive into [our] booth but where people were. He wanted to run people over. He passed 20 centimetres from my mum. She fell. My dad fell too. I turned and started screaming because I couldn’t see my mum.” Both parents survived. “She [Mum] stood up, Dad too, and at that moment I turned and saw the truck hitting a lamppost. People were lying around it and to the side.” For a moment there was an eerie quiet, Sefovac said. “Absolutely everyone was shocked.” Fearing a further attack, he and his parents fled. Jan Hollitzer, 37, deputy editor of the Berliner Morgenpost newspaper, said he heard a noise as the truck smashed into wooden stalls. “Then we heard screams, and the truck came out of the market on the left side.” Hollitzer walked across the street to the market. He saw devastation: broken glass, crockery and tables. Injured and dead people lay on the ground. “I saw the back of the truck. There were some people under the truck and it was really scary, really terrifying.” Two American tourists, Luke Theis, 21, and Lara Colombo, 22, from Washington DC, heard the commotion. “We started seeing people running and hearing ambulances from all directions, so we walked over,” Colombo said. “It was carnage everywhere. There was blood on the floor.” Theis added: “There were people lying on the floor. I’m not sure what their condition was. I could count about eight lying down. The biggest mental images I have is there were two rivers of blood going down the floor.” Another witness, Mike Fox, from Birmingham, said the truck missed him by three metres. “It happened so fast that there was nothing we could do to stop it,” he said. “If we’d tried to stop it we would have been crushed.” He said he saw people trapped under stalls and others who appeared to have broken limbs. “You do what you can to help who you can,” he told the Associated Press. An Australian student, Trisha O’Neill, said she saw the truck “crushing so many people. Then all the lights went out and everything was destroyed. I could hear screaming. We all froze. Then suddenly people started to move and lift all the wreckage off people, trying to help.” Sarah Dobler said she held the hand of one man as he lay in the street. He was in a bad way. “I’m not sure what nationality he was. He was trying to get up, but his head injury was quite severe. So I just held his hand and told him everything was going to be OK,” she told BBC Radio 5 Live. Facebook Twitter Pinterest The truck at the scene of the attack. Photograph: Action Press/Rex/Shutterstock The front of the lorry was a wreck. Christmas decorations had become lodged in its shattered windscreen. There was no sign of the person responsible for the rampage. Onlookers chased after a potential suspect, who was arrested less than two miles away, next to the Victory Column overlooking the Tiergarten. By Tuesday, however, detectives admitted they might have arrested the wrong person. Inside the cabin, police found the body of the truck’s registered driver, Lukasz Urban, a 37-year-old Pole. He had disappeared on Monday afternoon, and had been stabbed and shot. His boss in Poland, Ariel Zurawski, said he had helped German police identify the body. Urban’s face was swollen and bloodied, he said, adding that the driver would not have given up his vehicle without a fight. The marketplace, next to Berlin’s glossy shopping street Kurfürstendamm, looked like a warzone. The truck had come to a stop next to a stall with the words “Faszination Weihnachten” (Christmas fascination). Its pale blue canopy was torn off. There was a lot of debris: an upended crater of Becks beer, green bottles spilled on the street; red baubles; splintered wood. And under the lorry, a full-length Christmas tree topped with a gold star. Truck attacks in Berlin and Nice reflect change in Isis tactics Read more The toll from less than a minute of mayhem was 12 people dead – six of them Germans – and around 50 wounded. Eighteen of the injured were taken to hospital in a serious condition. The head of the federal criminal police, Holger Münch, said detectives were working on the assumption that it was an act of terrorism, but stressed that nothing was yet proven. At the time of the attack, several hundred people were watching the new Star Wars film, Rogue One, at the nearby Zoo Palast cinema. Stranded inside afterwards, they received calls from anxious friends and family. The police eventually let them go at 10.30pm, escorting them out through a side door. “This is everything that we feared,” one cinemagoer, Georg Gielen, told Der Spiegel. “This is now terror in Germany.” Subsequent screenings of Rogue One were cancelled. On Tuesday, hundreds of Berliners visited Breitscheidplatz. They lit candles and left flowers outside the Romanesque memorial church. Among them was Angela Merkel. The chancellor walked slowly past the scene, accompanied by ministers and bodyguards and carrying white roses. Inside the church – a symbol of reconciliation after the second world world war – she signed a book of condolence. The stillness of the market was striking. Normally at that time of the day it would be full of life and kitschy music. Instead, the wooden stalls still standing were all closed.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"The Snow Queen review – a shivery, darkly comic delight", "content": "The opening moments of Lee Lyford’s production, with its baby puppet versions of the young Gerda and Kai, are so delightful that you fear they might be hard to top, but Vivienne Franzmann’s deliciously dark rewrite of Hans Christian Andersen’s original story keeps on delivering. Like all the most terrifying nursery monsters, the Snow Queen herself begins as an idea, becomes a shadow and eventually looms into life – in this case, as a monstrous outsize puppet with piercing zephyr-blue eyes. This is probably not one for the younger members of the family. Everyone else is likely to be both charmed and scarily entertained by a story with some ingenious revisions that tells how a goblin army is snatching children from villages and taking them to the Snow Queen’s palace, where she feeds on their tantrums and tempers. In Tom Rogers’ striking design, even the wooden beams of the sunny village houses bear hints of ice shards. The design really comes into its own in the chilling scene in which the goblin Dr Boffin experiments in a lab where the children are deep-frozen in ice. Yes, it is quite bleak, but it’s often niftily comic and fetchingly camp in a scenario that celebrates difference, and different kinds of bravery, with a light touch. Kai is singled out by the village bullies because he is friends with a girl and prefers dance to football, Gerda has to learn to overcome her fears, and there is a neat little nod to the idea that the relationship between Gerda and the Little Robber Girl might blossom into something more grown up. But first, Gerda has to defeat the Snow Queen, who is determined to secure the big fat heart of Kai, so full of affection and friendship, and transform his love into the hate on which she gorges. Gerda’s quest becomes one for love itself, and all the characters she meets along the way are exceptionally vivid, from the absurd Flower Witch, who tempts her with a memory-erasing muffin, to a depressed reindeer who must be roused from his apathy. Facebook Twitter Pinterest The Flower Witch in The Snow Queen. Photograph: Mark Douet I wasn’t convinced by the revolutionary insurrection interlude, and the environmental angle is perhaps a bit tub-thumping in a show already bustling with themes. The production just needs some paring and a tad more narrative clarity But there’s no need to trim any of Gwyneth Herbert’s delightful songs and their deadpan wit. Emily Burnett and Steven Roberts are winning as Gerda and Kai, and the rest of the cast are fantastic, too, working tirelessly as an ensemble and turning in standout cameos. I particularly liked Dylan Wood as the resigned Anton the Reindeer, and Joanna Holden who brings real comic clout to Boffin Goblin and the Robber Mum. A shivery treat. • At Bristol Old Vic until 15 January. Box office: 0117-987 7877.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Truck attacks in Berlin and Nice reflect change in Islamic State tactics", "content": "The Berlin killings appear to have been modelled on the Bastille Day truck attack in Nice, a tactic that has become a focus of propaganda by Islamic State over the past month. At least 12 people died and dozens were injured on Monday night when a lorry was driven into a Christmas market in the centre of the German capital. The chancellor, Angela Merkel, said on Tuesday it had to be assumed “we are dealing with a terrorist attack”. Berlin police say man in custody over market attack might not be truck driver – live Read more In terms of both its chosen target and method, the Berlin attack has echoes of the slaughter brought to the French coastal city in July by a Tunisian-born French resident. In that attack, 86 people were killed and hundreds injured when Mohamed Lahouaiej-Bouhlel drove a 19-tonne lorry down the city’s Promenade des Anglais into a crowd that had gathered for a firework display. On 21 November, the US state department advised tourists in Europe to “exercise caution at holiday festivals, events, and outdoor markets” for fear terrorists would use “both conventional and non-conventional weapons” to wreak havoc over the Christmas period. “Credible information indicates the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (Isil or Da’esh), al-Qaida, and their affiliates continue to plan terrorist attacks in Europe, with a focus on the upcoming holiday season and associated events,” the alert said. “US citizens should also be alert to the possibility that extremist sympathisers or self-radicalised extremists may conduct attacks during this period with little or no warning.” Facebook Twitter Pinterest Berlin Christmas market attack: what we know – video report The US authorities are well aware, however, that vehicle attacks pose just as serious a threat in the US as in Europe. A week after the travel alert was issued, a Somali-born student at Ohio State University rammed a car into a crowd of people and then attacked them with a butcher’s knife, injuring 11 before he was shot dead. The attacker, Abdul Razak Ali Artan, had earlier railed on social media against the treatment of Muslims around the world, and Isis claimed he had been acting as a “soldier” on its behalf, but it is unclear how much he had drawn on Isis material as inspiration. “This tactic goes back to al-Qaida talking about it. And Isis first picked it up in 2014,” said Peter Bergen, director for international security at the New America thinktank. “The barriers to entry are almost zero. The only thing you have to know how to do is drive. Now we are looking to the inauguration with a huge number of people in Washington and US officials are aware of it as a threat.” In recent weeks there have been increasing signs that Isis, as it loses ground in Iraq and comes under increased military pressure in Syria, is putting ever greater emphasis on striking back by inviting aspiring jihadis in the west to carry out attacks with heavy vehicles. The November edition of the Isis magazine, Rumiyah (Rome), used Nice as an example of the kind of attacks jihadis could carry out “behind enemy lines”. “Though being an essential part of modern life, very few actually comprehend the deadly and destructive capability of the motor vehicle and its capacity of reaping large numbers of casualties if used in a premeditated manner,” a Rumiyah commentary said. “They feel the pressure,” said Hassan Hassan, co-author of a book on the group, Isis: Inside the Army of Terror. “They want to make themselves look like they are still there and that they are overshadowing al-Qaida. They are also responding to widespread criticism that they are only bringing devastation to Sunni towns.” On 25 November, French authorities announced the arrest of five people believed to be plotting attacks on a Christmas market on the Champs-Élysées in Paris and at Disneyland Paris. The alleged plot in that case was said to involve weapons that had been hidden for use by the attackers. Isis’s new approach appears to reflect an awareness that the use of firearms can make a planned attack vulnerable to being thwarted by western intelligence. The use of trucks is an attempt to avoid that vulnerability. The Berlin incident comes after Isis claimed responsibility for two attacks in Germany this year. A 27-year-old Syrian blew himself up in Ansbach in July, killing himself and wounding others. In the same month, a man wielding an axe carried out an attack on a train in Würzburg, injuring four.",diasaster:0},

The bishop of Truro is right to recognise that, rather, the heart of the problem is at the parish level, though calling for “wider doors” is too unspecific to be itself a solution. Multi-ethnic parishes raise specific challenges: on the one hand of identifying and countering the ways racism in its various forms nullifies our ministry; and on the other hand, of needing to develop the “cultural intelligence” to respond to very varied expectations of church (as evidenced in the account of the United Pentecostal Faith church in Lambeth). Until we are as serious about training and equipping clergy specifically for multi-ethnic communities as we are about equipping ministers for, say, academic communities, we will continue to fail to generate effective multi-ethnic parishes or to produce substantial numbers of minority ethnic senior leaders.

{ "title":"The Guardian view on the recapture of Ramadi: hard, but there is harder still to come", "content": "Iraq’s flag flies over Ramadi again. Never mind that it is the flag of a divided and weakened country which may or may not ever again be a united nation in the sense that it once was. Nor that Ramadi itself is no great prize. It was badly damaged in the fighting that preceded its seizure by Islamic State forces in May, much of what was left has been destroyed during the campaign to recapture the city, and some areas may still be under Isis control. Bringing back its displaced population will be difficult and reviving the wider economy of its hinterland even harder. Nor can a fresh Isis takeover be ruled out, as Hoshiyah Zebari, an Iraqi minister, warned after news of the victory reached Baghdad. And yet this is an important victory all the same. First, it is an example of the kind of co-ordinated effort by Iraqi forces and coalition aircraft that has been seen only sporadically before. Second, it has been achieved by the Iraqi army, acting without the support of the Shia militias which has proved so problematic in earlier advances, like that toward Tikrit, because their presence, and sometimes their behaviour, has alienated the Sunni population. If the air-ground cooperation represents the technical military key to dealing with Isis, the exclusion of the militias is the political key. It is to be followed, the Iraqis say, by a partial handover of security to tribal forces in Anbar province: Sunnis will defend Sunnis and Sunnis will police Sunnis. This is a step in the right direction. There are parallels with the Sunni awakening, which enabled the Americans and Iraqis to turn the tide against al-Qaida in 2006, and indeed, this time round, American soldiers have returned to Anbar province to try to repeat that success. They have come in far smaller numbers, and with far fewer resources. There must be serious doubts that what was possible at the height of the American surge will again be possible today. But it is also true that the Iraqi government may this time have learned the lesson it refused to learn in the years after the awakening, when it reneged on the promises it had made to the Sunnis, wriggled out of commitments to integrate Sunni fighters into the national forces, and stopped paying the subsidies that sustained those fighters, the so-called Sons of Iraq. It was this betrayal, we can see clearly in retrospect, that finally broke Iraq and prepared the way for Isis. It would be foolish to take Ramadi as some sort of early tipping point against Isis. The truth is that we simply don’t know. But this movement does depend on creating a pervasive sense of its unstoppability, on making people believe that it is making history. One reverse will hardly stop it in its tracks, but if it is followed by more, perceptions of its success and its chances of permanence could change. The next step in Iraq could be a drive on Fallujah, where the position of Isis has been weakened by the fall of Ramadi. But the real challenge for Baghdad will be Mosul. Ramadi and Fallujah are small places, Mosul is a big city. It is a city under occupation and no doubt many people there chafe at the exactions, the brutalities, and the arbitrariness of Isis rule. But how to convince the population there that the government in Baghdad could become a government for all Iraqis, while not undermining any such change in feeling by inflicting high civilian casualties, is a hard problem for the future. What will be hardest of all to undermine is the Isis story, which is that Islam is under attack, has been for centuries, and that now is the moment for Muslims to rise up and dedicate themselves to its defence. Particularly effective among disenchanted and marginalised Muslims, although not necessarily poor or ill-educated ones, this is a narrative that has powerful appeal. If and when physical control of Isis territories is wrested from them, that narrative will survive, but it will be weakened. That must be the ultimate aim and Ramadi, it is to be hoped, is a small step along that road.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"James Corden calls for continued funds for young talent once BBC3 goes online", "content": "James Corden has urged the BBC to make sure young writers, directors and actors are still funded to make new shows once BBC3 is made online only. The BBC will stop broadcasting the youth-oriented channel from February, but the comedian turned talk-show host said it would not matter if people were watching on smartphones or laptops as long as there were still resources to help new talent break through. “It’s not a question of does it exist on television or doesn’t it exist on television,” Corden told the Radio Times. “It’s a question of whether there’s still the budget and funds to make television shows and support new writers. “It’s a wonderful place to learn your craft and make shows that might be elevated to BBC1 or BBC2 ... The future of the BBC is the next generation. I just hope there’s a plan in place to maintain an outlet for new young voices to be heard.” BBC3 TV channel to be switched off by February, BBC Trust confirms Read more Corden got his break on BBC3 show Gavin and Stacey but is now a fixture of US TV at the helm of CBS’s The Late Late Show. He is also hosting his ninth series of A League of Their Own on Sky1, with former sports stars Andrew “Freddie” Flintoff and Jamie Redknapp returning as team captains along with actor Jack Whitehall as a regular panel member. Whitehall’s career was also given a boost by BBC3 through the sitcom Bad Education. He told the Radio Times that the corporation dedicated plenty of resources to programmes featuring “white people walking around in bonnets” but needed to ensure “they keep enough money in their pot” for TV made by and for younger people. “It needs to be distributed across the board and not all weighted towards BBC1 dramas aimed at an older audience,” he said. In November, the BBC Trust approved plans to take BBC3 off air by February as part of plans to save £30m, some of which will be redirected into its BBC1 drama budget. The BBC has promised to continue providing shows aimed at the channel’s young audience online with a budget of £30m, about £6m of which is earmarked for short form content. The BBC has been told by the trust to ensure that longer programmes commissioned for the online-only BBC3 are also shown on BBC1 or BBC2 at a variety of times rather than being pushed into graveyard slots late at night. It has also been told to show more TV aimed at young people on BBC1 and BBC2 in addition to what it makes for BBC3. The BBC is spending almost half of its paid-for advertising budget for the current financial year on telling the public about the switchover, but Trust research has shown that up to 80% of the 925,000 people who use no other BBC TV could switch off following the shift. Writing about the BBC3 move to online last month, controller Damian Kavanagh name-checked Gavin and Stacey, which ran for three series until 2010, as the sort of show the online channel will continue to make. Though no plans for a fourth series have been revealed, Corden has previously said he hopes to return to the show.

Pulling Co-written by Sharon Horgan and Dennis Kelly, the critically acclaimed BBC3 comedy won Horgan a British Comedy award for her performance as Donna. Kelly has since co-written Matilda the Musical with Tim Minchin, and Channel 4 drama Utopia. Horgan returned to UK screens with Catastrophe, created and written with US standup Rob Delaney. A second series aired in October. Nighty Night Audiences first experienced the full force of Julia Davis dark humour with her BBC3 show Nighty Night. She has since won a Bafta for Hunderby, her Sky Atlantic comedy in which she plays a woman shipwrecked on the English coast in the 1830s. Russell Howard’s Good News Standup Howard followed up a BBC Six Music radio show with an irreverant news roundup for BBC3 in 2009. Its ninth series transferred to BBC2 in 2014, followed by a tenth earlier this year. Howard has also become a regular on panel shows such as Mock the Week while continuing to pull in crowds for his live shows. Little Britain After its first outing on BBC3, Little Britain became a huge success on BBC1, pulling 9.5 million viewers in its third series. As a double act Matt Lucas and David Walliams continued to produce hits such as airport sitcom Come Fly With Me. Walliams has also become a judge on Britain’s Got Talent and a successful children’s author. Gavin and Stacey The double Bafta-winning Gavin and Stacey offered new success for established faces such as Allison Steadman and Rob Brydon while kickstarting the careers of relative unknowns. Co-writer Ruth Jones, who played Nessa Jones, went on to write and star in Sky comedy Stella, while James Corden and Mathew Horne continued a successful run as a double act. But while Horne has found moderate success (including appearing with Jack Whitehall in Bad Education) Corden’s star has shone brightest with his US breakthrough as host of The Late Late Show earlier this year.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Cleveland officer who fatally shot Tamir Rice will not face criminal charges", "content": "The white police officer who fatally shot Tamir Rice, an African American 12-year-old, will not face criminal charges, it was announced on Monday – more than a year after the shooting in Cleveland. A grand jury declined to indict officer Timothy Loehmann, who opened fire on Tamir less than two seconds after arriving at a park where the 12-year-old was playing with a toy gun on 22 November 2014. Loehmann’s partner, Frank Garmback, will also face no charges, the Cuyahoga county prosecutor, Timothy McGinty, announced at a press conference. McGinty argued that Tamir’s death was caused by a “perfect storm of human error, mistakes and miscommunications by all involved that day” but there was no evidence of criminal misconduct by police. The two officers believed they were responding to a “potential active shooter situation” and had not been provided with crucial details of a 911 call reporting that Rice was probably a juvenile with a gun that was “probably fake”, McGinty said. “Had the officers been aware of these qualifiers, the training officer who was driving might have approached the scene with less urgency; lives may not have been put at stake,” McGinty said. Subodh Chandra, an attorney for Tamir’s mother Samaria, said they had been given no information about the announcement beforehand and had learned it was taking place through a public statement made by the county prosecutor’s office about an hour earlier. McGinty said he had spoken to Samaria Rice shortly before the decision was made public. “It was a tough conversation,” McGinty said, adding “she was broken up”. In a statement, Tamir’s family said they were “saddened and disappointed” by the outcome, “but not surprised”. “It has been clear for months now that Cuyahoga County prosecutor Timothy McGinty was abusing and manipulating the grand jury process to orchestrate a vote against indictment,” the statement said. The family accused McGinty of mishandling the grand jury process, by hiring expert witnesses and allowing the officers to read prepared statements, which “compounded the grief of this family”. Cleveland’s mayor, Frank Jackson, said the city would now begin an administrative review process of the incident, and would not comment on whether the grand jury’s decision not to charge the officers was an “appropriate outcome”. “This has caused the city of Cleveland – with the loss of a child at the hands of a police officer – to do a lot of soul searching so that an incident like this will never happen again,” Jackson said. The Rice family filed an amended civil case against the city in January. Two months later the city responded by arguing in a defense filing that Tamir’s own actions had “directly and proximately” caused his own death. The filing was followed by an apology from Jackson, who described the wording as “very insensitive”. On Monday, McGinty argued that the civil lawsuit “may yet provide the Rice family with some of the accountability they deserve”. Jackson also said the city would protect “everyone’s right to express themselves if they disagree with the grand jury’s decision. But your rights end when you do harm to people and property when expressing your opinion. Our position on that hasn’t changed.” Despite the expectation of protests on Monday, Cleveland remained relatively quiet on a freezing night. However, some people expressed their anger after the announcement. “We need to shut this city down,” said activist Art McKoy at a gazebo set up at the park where Tamir Rice was shot. The picnic table inside the gazebo still held many stuffed animals and candles left behind by Rice family supporters during the past year. “The pastors and the politicians and the business leaders have all told us to keep quiet and we will get justice, but we can all see that that has not happened,” said McKoy, “We need to shut this city down so we can show that [no-billing of the officers] is not acceptable.” About 30 people met at the gazebo in the early evening hours to share prayers and support each other. Earlier in the day, a few protesters had blocked traffic for a few minutes in front of the park, but they moved on fairly quickly. “It is disappointing, but not surprising,” said Khalid Samad, another activist gathered at the park. Samad runs Coalition for a Better Life, a non-profit organization that promotes peace within Cleveland neighborhoods. Sources in the prosecutor’s office told the Guardian that local business and political leaders had asked for the grand jury announcement to come during Christmas vacation time to limit the size of crowds. The prosecutor’s handling of the grand jury process, which began in October, has been heavily criticised by the Rice family and local activists, after the prosecutor proceeded to drip-feed evidence seen by the grand jury to the public, which included reports from experts concluding that the shooting was justified. Tamir Rice is 'moral conscience' for activists one year after fatal shooting Read more Neither Loehmann nor Garmback appeared before the grand jury, and instead provided unsworn statements that were read to jurors earlier in the month. Loehmann claimed he shot because Tamir pulled the pellet gun from his waistband, “had been threatening others with the weapon and had not obeyed our command to show us his hands”. Tamir’s family argued it would have been impossible for the officers to have issued commands given the fraction of time that elapsed before shots were fired. McGinty argued on Monday that a grainy enhanced CCTV image of the moment before Loehmann opened fire showed it was “indisputable that Tamir was drawing his gun from his waist”. McGinty said this single image was “perhaps the most critical piece of evidence” in the whole case. “At the point where they suddenly came together, both Tamir and the rookie officer were no doubt frightened.” McGinty said. “If we put ourselves in the victim’s shoes, as prosecutors and detectives try to do, it is likely that Tamir, whose size made him look much older and who had been warned that his pellet gun might get him into trouble that day, either intended to hand it over to the officers or show them it wasn’t a real gun. “But there was no way for the officers to know that because they saw events rapidly unfolding in front of them from a very different perspective.” The prosecutor pointed to a number of reforms that have been implemented in the county since Tamir’s death, including an agreement between the federal government and the Cleveland police department to reform use of force and other major policy issues, and the roll-out of body cameras and dashboard cameras. He also called on the manufacturers of toy guns to modify their designs. “If the color and design of Tamir’s pellet gun had screamed toy, then the call that set this tragedy into motion may have never happened,” he said. McGinty left the press conference without answering questions from reporters. Samaria Rice had testified to the grand jury about the loss of her son. In a statement, her attorney said that she had asked the jurors whether the officers’ actions “could possibly be ‘reasonable’ or ‘justifiable’”. It said: “She believes that the answer is plainly no.” Tamir’s death in 2014 followed the high-profile police killings of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri and Eric Garner in Staten Island, New York, which sparked a new civil rights movement across the United States and calls for reform of US policing. Tamir’s family renewed their call on Monday for the Department of Justice to conduct an investigation into the shooting.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Lidl rides the wave of UK wine boom", "content": "Lidl is to sell English wine for the first time, in a major commercial boost for the burgeoning industry. As part of its latest push to attract well-heeled shoppers, the German discount supermarket will stock three Broadwood’s Folly wines made by the award-winning producer Denbies, based in Surrey. The wines, which will go on sale in early March as part of Lidl’s Easter offering, will retail at £7.99 for the rosé and white and £14.99 for the sparkling variety. In July 2014 the supermarket unveiled a £12m push into the premier wine market, dubbed the “Bordeaux offensive” and its biggest UK product launch, in a bid to woo middle-class shoppers and pitting it against the likes of Waitrose, Sainsbury’s, Tesco and Morrisons. The bargain fine wine range, which includes Châteauneuf-du-Pape and Château La Tour, has fuelled a 40% increase in Lidl’s wine sales over the last year. The company has used its European clout to buy wine in large volumes and pass on price savings to customers, and aims to make products seen as exclusive more accessible. Denbies is the UK’s largest vineyard and currently produces around 10% of the country’s wine. Ben Hulme, the head of beers, wines and spirits at Lidl, said: “We are delighted to be offering a range of English wines as part of our Easter Wine Cellar range. The English wine industry is growing and is something we as a retailer are keen to support, therefore we are excited to have partnered with the Denbies Wine Estate to stock three delicious English wines; a white, rosé and a sparkling wine.” “It is a great time for English wines,” said Julia Trustram Eve of the English Wine Producers trade body. “With the ever-growing consumer interest in, and demand for English wines, this is an exciting move within the multiple sector to make English wines even more accessible.” The growing popularity of English wine has fuelled a rush to develop UK vineyards, with applications rising by more than 40% in the past year, new figures reveal. Miles Beale, the chief executive of the Wine and Spirit Trade Association, said: “The production of English wine has seen record vintages in the last two years with 4.5m bottles in 2013 and 6.3m bottles in 2014. Based on the latest growth figures, this is set to double, with a staggering 12m bottles of English wine per year expected by 2020.” Marks & Spencer recently launched its first Welsh wine, the Tintern Parva bacchus from Parva Farm Vineyards in Monmouthshire, and for Christmas it offered its first magnum of English sparkling wine, the 2010 Ridgeview Blanc de Blancs. Waitrose, which stocks more than 100 English and Welsh wines, reported a 95% increase in sales of its range in 2014, and in October it stocked its first English dessert wine, again from Denbies. The growing popularity of English wine has been helped by a renaissance in English food. Chefs want local wine to go with their locally sourced food, and English wine is now on the menus of high-end restaurants owned by Gordon Ramsay, Heston Blumenthal and Jamie Oliver.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Disney breaks $7bn global box office record for 2016", "content": "Disney has become the first film studio to take $7bn (£5.7bn) in global ticket sales in a year, with Star Wars spin-off Rogue One joining the hit factory production line alongside Marvel superheroes and animated children’s movies. With Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, the spin-off tale of the mission to steal the plans for the Death Star, taking almost $300m (£323m) globally on its opening weekend, Disney has easily shot past the previous $6.9bn annual ticket sales record set by rival Universal last year with hits including Jurassic World and Furious 7. With almost two weeks of the year left, the momentum generated by the most famous sci-fi franchise in the world and the popularity of the studio’s animated film Moana ($282m and counting) is likely to push Disney’s overall takings closer to $8bn. Disney has already released the four top-grossing films of the year so far with Captain America: Civil War, Finding Dory and Zootopia taking more than $1bn at the global box office, while a live-action version of The Jungle Book fell just short. Doctor Strange, starring Benedict Cumberbatch, released in November, has made more than $650m to date. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Finding Dory grossed more than $1bn at the box office in 2016. Photograph: Disney/Rex/Shutterstock The record haul is the crowning achievement of a decade long strategy to reinvigorate Disney’s film division by buying up blockbuster franchises, characters and talent. In 2006, Disney spent $7.4bn buying Apple founder Steve Jobs’ Pixar, the hit factory behind Finding Nemo, its sequel Finding Dory, Toy Story and The Incredibles, to help revive its once proud tradition of producing hit animated films. This was followed in 2009 by the surprise $4bn purchase of Marvel Comics’ superhero universe, bringing in characters including X-Men, Iron Man and Captain America, which took Disney into new live action territory. The third transformational deal was snapping up George Lucas’ Lucasfilm, maker of Star Wars and the Indiana Jones franchises, in a $4bn deal in 2012, with a plan to vastly expand the sci-fi franchise starting with 2015’s The Force Awakens. The $15bn of deals, which were in each case criticised by City investors as overpriced, were the brainchild of Bob Iger, Walt Disney chief executive. “It was almost standard practice to say five and 10 years ago that Disney overpaid, but you see from the performance of the films from those divisions that they were essential to the company’s success,” says Guy Bisson, research director at Ampere Analysis. When Iger took the helm in 2005 Disney was still licking its wounds, having fought off a hostile takeover attempt by cable TV company Comcast, which went on to take a stake in studio MGM and buy NBC Universal and DreamWorks. Its animation-led film operation was struggling. That year the company managed to get just one film in the global top 10, The Chronicles of Narnia: the Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. And its studio was ranked fourth among the top five in the world’s biggest market, the US. Fastforward to 2016 and Disney accounts for five of the top 10 grossing films this year. Star Wars: The Force Awakens has been Disney’s single biggest hit, raking in $2.07bn, spread across two calendar years of box office takings as it launched in December 2015. Rogue One looks set to also break $1bn but will also see its box office take split across two calendar years. “Management had a vision that proved to be correct,” says Bisson. “They focused on strong characters that work across all their business lines – toys, merchandising and theme parks; and it has been very advantageous that the franchises breathe sequels and spin-offs very naturally, and they are also very popular among the key audiences of millennials and the younger generation.” Facebook Twitter Pinterest Artist’s impression of the new Disney theme park Star Wars Land. Photograph: Disney/Lucasfilm Disney is currently constructing a Star Wars Land at its flagship US theme parks, which will include a ride where visitors take control of the Millennium Falcon, and the Pirates of the Caribbean ride, which spawned the Johnny Depp mega-franchise, has recently been expanded to its Shanghai Disneyland. Another Disney blockbuster, Frozen, is reportedly the biggest merchandise moneyspinner of all time, with sales of more than $107bn. Hollywood’s movie secret, which Disney happens to have mastered the best, at least for now, is that bigger is better and less is more. In 2005, the top five studios released 173 films, with Disney launching 31, according to Box Office Mojo. In 2016 that number has dropped to 118, with Disney down 60% with just 13. “Since the financial crash studios had to rework the way they did things and cut their slates back,” says David Hancock, director, head of film and cinema, at IHS Markit. “Very few, very big films drive the box office upwards.” The question is whether, or how long, Disney can keep its box office crown. The studio will get a running start with about two-thirds of Rogue One’s global ticket sales counting toward’s next year’s tally. And with a big titles including the second Guardians of the Galaxy movie, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales and Thor: Ragnarok, Disney is banking on another sequel-tastic year of blockbusters. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Disney will release a sequel to Guardians of the Galaxy in 2017. Photograph: AP The 65-year old Iger, whose contract at Disney runs until 2018, will also be looking to the force for box office gold next year. Disney will be banking on once again trouncing rivals with the hope that Star Wars: Episode VIII will join just Avatar, Titanic and The Force Awakens in the exclusive $2bn-plus box office club. “The next film in the Star Wars saga has the potential to claim the title as the biggest movie of all time,” said Paul Dergarabedian, a film analyst with comScore.

{ "title":"Berlin Christmas market attack killer still on the loose, say police", "content": "A hunt is under way in Germany for an armed attacker suspected of driving a truck into a crowded Christmas market in Berlin, killing 12 people and injuring dozens more. Earlier hopes that the perpetrator had been caught after a heroic chase by a member of the public through a park were dashed when police said they had arrested the wrong man. “We need to work on the assumption that an armed perpetrator is still on the loose,” Holger Münch, the head of the federal criminal police office, told a press conference. “We are on high alert and are investigating every possible angle.” On Tuesday night, Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attack, although there is no evidence yet for their claim. Through its Amaq news agency, the jihadi group claimed the attacker was a “soldier of the Islamic State”. The phrasing matches that used to claim previous lone wolf attacks, such as the incident in Orlando in June when 49 people were killed at a gay nightclub. Earlier, special forces stormed Berlin’s largest refugee shelter, at a hangar at the now disused Tempelhof airport in central Berlin, where the arrested man had been registered. They interviewed residents and removed a laptop and mobile phone. The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, speaking before the suspect was released, condemned the attack as gruesome, saying it would be repugnant if the attacker turned out to be a person seeking asylum in Germany. The far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) said Germany was no longer safe. The party’s leader, Frauke Petry, accused Merkel of “importing terror to Germany over the past one and a half years”. Hours later, the arrested suspect, a 23-year-old asylum seeker from Pakistan who had arrived in Germany a year ago, was released by police. The death toll rose on Tuesday from nine to 12, while doctors worked to save lives and treat injuries, including many cases of internal bleeding or loss of limbs. It was confirmed that none of the dead were children, but six were identified as German ­citizens. Eighteen people were being treated in Berlin clinics for what were described as very serious injuries. There were reports on Tuesday night that the family of missing 31-year-old Italian, Fabrizia di Lorenzo, feared she was one of the dead. She did not turn up to work and her phone and travel card were found at the crime scene. Her father, Gaetano, was reported as saying that he had given up hope of seeing her again. The Polish-registered truck careered into the market off a main road at around 8pm local time on Monday. It is believed to have been laden with 20 tonnes of steel girders. It travelled for about 80 metres at a reported 70-80kph before crashing into wooden stalls and shoppers and coming to a halt outside the Kaiser Wilhelm memorial church. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Police and fire officers inspect the damaged truck. Photograph: Michael Kappeler/EPA The truck manufacturer Scania declined to comment on the tragedy. German media speculated that the perpetrator must have disabled or overridden the vehicle’s automated braking system to carry out the attack. There are about 2,500 Christmas markets in Germany, including 60 in the capital, and questions are being asked about whether they are well enough protected from the threat of terrorism. Security experts have warned for years that they could be a soft target for terrorists because they are rarely cordoned off and have few or no bag checks. In November, US authorities warned their citizens to avoid Germany’s Christmas markets, considering them to be a high risk. No such warning was issued by German authorities. The German police, whose numbers have been bolstered in the wake of recent, smaller terrorist incidents, pledged to increase the number of stone bollards placed at markets and there were calls for better monitoring of heavy-load vehicles on German roads. Klaus Kandt, Berlin’s police president, said there was a limit to what could be done to protect the markets, a mainstay of the German Christmas. “We can’t turn Christmas markets into fortresses,” he said. “There are so many possibilities to kill people with a truck. You will never be able to eliminate the risk.” Investigators have removed the black truck from the site for forensic examination. People left flowers at the scene and notes, one of which read: “Keep on living, Berliners!” 'It was terrifying': Berlin market attack witnesses describe carnage Read more Merkel joined the mourners on Tuesday afternoon, walking slowly past the scene accompanied by ministers and bodyguards and carrying white roses. Inside the church – a symbol of reconciliation after the second world world war – she signed a book of condolence. Lana Sefovac, a Bosnian who lives in Berlin, was at the entrance of the market drinking mulled wine with his family when the vehicle bore down upon him. “I was standing in front of the stall. My father was in front of me. My mum was behind,” he said. “I heard a very, very noisy sound and when I turned towards it, the first thing I saw was wood flying all around because he literally smashed the first wooden booth by driving very fast. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Angela Merkel visits the scene of the market attack on Tuesday “He was driving directly toward us, directly into us. But then he made a turn because he did not want to drive into [our] booth but where people were. He wanted to run people over. “He passed 20cm from my mum. She fell. My dad fell, too. I turned and started screaming because I couldn’t see my mum.” Both parents survived. Among the dead was the vehicle’s registered driver, Łukasz Urban, a 37-year-old Polish national who it is believed tried to fight off his assailant before being stabbed and shot. As police tried to piece together the truck’s journey, Ariel Żurawski, the Polish company that owned the vehicle, said it had lost touch with its driver at around 4pm local time. Investigators were quick to question whether they had arrested the right man because the inside of the driver’s cab was covered in blood but there were no traces of blood or gunshot residue on the suspect. While many markets remained closed on Tuesday as a mark of respect, Germany’s interior minister urged people to continue to visit them. He said it was expected that carousels, rollercoasters and the other more rowdy aspects of the markets would remain closed for some days, but “it would be a nice thing to go to a market and buy a crib”. The police said the first they knew of the existence of the rogue truck was when it had crashed and they were called to the scene. They had not received notification from the truck’s owner that he had lost track of it. Footage from CCTV around Breitscheidplatz where the incident took place and from traffic cameras on the roads leading to the square was being analysed by investigators, but police told German media they were “searching for a needle in a haystack”.

The president, Joachim Gauck, said the church, which was badly bombed during the war, had suffered “another open wound” but stood witness to Berlin’s ability to overcome difficult times. The Brandenburg Gate was lit up in the colours of the German flag. “Too many times we have had to light up the Brandenburg Gate in the various colours of various nations that have seen terrorist attacks,” said the city’s mayor, Michael Müller. “This time the Brandenburg Gate will be lit up in our own national colours.”",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Fracking to go ahead in North Yorkshire after high court ruling", "content": "Fracking will go ahead at a North Yorkshire site after environmentalists lost a legal challenge they had brought on climate change grounds. On Tuesday, the high court ruled against Friends of the Earth and Frack Free Ryedale, who had argued that North Yorkshire county council had failed to properly consider the environmental impact of burning gas when it approved the fracking this year. Mrs Justice Lang sided with the council in her judgment, meaning energy company Third Energy is now free to use the controversial method of extracting shale gas at the village of Kirby Misperton, in the Ryedale district. “I’m obviously disappointed in the verdict but it doesn’t end here. There is no support in North Yorkshire for this risky industry,” said Jackie Cray, a retired vicar from Kirby Misperton, and claimant in the case. She vowed to continue to campaign against fracking in the area. Donna Hume, a campaigner at Friends of the Earth, said: “The judge found that North Yorkshire councillors had assessed the impacts of climate change. But we know that climate change was barely mentioned at that crucial council meeting where the decision to allow fracking was taken, and more damningly, that councillors didn’t have the information about the total carbon emissions produced from the fracking project.” The green group, which was ordered to pay £10,000 in costs, said it would not appeal the decision. The Green Party called the ruling a “bitter blow” and the Liberal Democrats said it was “bitterly disappointing.” Greenpeace warned that “fracking companies shouldn’t underestimate the strength of feeling on this issue.” Third Energy welcomed the judgment and said it looked forward to establishing whether gas could be produced from the site. “The permission places a great obligation on Third Energy to prove that we can carry out the test fracs in the same safe, discreet and environmentally sensitive way that we have conducted our gas exploration and energy generation activities over the past two decades,” said chief executive Rasik Valand. “We are confident that we will prove to the local community that their elected representatives were right to grant this permission.” The company had hoped to hydraulically fracture the site this year, but the delay caused by the judicial review means fracking is unlikely to begin until 2017. Unlike some other exploratory shale gas sites, the well has already been drilled. The actual fracking process – which involves pumping water, sand and chemicals underground at high pressure to release natural gas – will take about six weeks. Fracking has so far been approved at only two sites in the UK: Kirby Misperton and Preston New Road in the Fylde, Lancashire. A government decision on a third site, also in the Fylde, is expected soon.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Norway reprieves 32 of 47 wolves earmarked for cull", "content": "The Norwegian government has issued a last-minute reprieve for 32 of the 47 wolves that had been earmarked for a cull to protect sheep flocks. The plans to kill two-thirds of the country’s wolves caused outrage among conservationists at home and abroad when they were announced by local predator management boards in September, with warnings the cull would be disastrous for the species. But on Tuesday Vidar Helgesen, minister of climate and the environment, refused to sanction the cull, saying lawyers at the justice ministry had concluded it would contravene domestic biodiversity legislation and the international Bern convention. The laws state that culling of endangered predators – there are an estimated 68 wolves in Norway – can only be granted if there is a satisfactorily documented risk of damage to livestock. This proved not to have been the case with 32 wolves from four packs in the county of Hedmark. Norway plans to cull more than two-thirds of its wolf population Read more The other 15 animals which will still be hunted are young lone wolves which range over greater distances and are more prone to killing livestock, and environmental groups have not objected to these being culled. “This is a great day and the best Christmas present you could wish for,” said Nina Jensen of WWF Norway. “At last the government has shown that Norwegian wolves also have protection in law. It is a protected species that is critically endangered and has a natural place in Norwegian fauna.” Today’s pardon for the 32 wolves caused surprise among both the conservation and hunting lobbies, as the government had been expected to support the cull. More than 300 hunters who were cooperating with the police and the county governor to prepare for the hunt, due to start on 2 January, now have to put away their guns. “This was a surprising decision based on odd reasoning,” said Arnfinn Nergård, director of the predator management board in Hedmark county. The framework for predator management has been set by parliament, with local predator management boards setting hunting and culling quotas when population targets have been achieved. The final decision for a cull, however, is given by the government. The rejection of sanctioned culls, coupled with continuing rural community concerns over wolves, has raised the prospect of illegal poaching. Nergård declined to comment on the possibility of poaching, but said the wolf population has recovered considerably after six local poachers were imprisoned in an unprecedented case two years ago. “This may suggest that extensive poaching was taking place,” he conceded. Norway's wolf cull pits sheep farmers against conservationists Read more Environmental groups attribute their victory not only to the wolf’s iconic status, but also to more than 70,000 Norwegians who signed a petition protesting against the proposed culling. Helgesen received close to 7,000 emails in both Norwegian and English, and the story made headlines around Europe. “It proves that pressure from environmental groups and public opinion matters,” said Silje Ask Lundberg of Friends of the Earth Norway. “Predator management in Norway has not always been based on sound knowledge. The Berne convention clearly states that endangered predators can only be culled if the individuals have been proven to cause extensive damage. “That has not been the case with these wolves who over a period of six years have only been documented to kill 10 sheep, and that was due to a hole in a fence.”",diasaster:0},

Initial assessments indicate everything is working correctly and the spacecraft is now ready to begin a three-year mission. DAMPE, which is also known as Wukong, after the monkey king in the Chinese fairytale Journey to the West, blasted off on 17 December from Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center, Gansu province. Carried on a Long March 2D booster, the spacecraft was placed in a 500km-altitude orbit. Dark matter as elusive as ever – despite space station results | Stuart Clark Read more Signals and data received shortly afterwards show that the spacecraft is working as expected and that the data is good quality, according to China’s Xinhua News Agency. Dark Matter is thought to account for most of the mass in the universe, outweighing atoms by about six times. It gives rise to the otherwise unaccountably fast rotation rates of most galaxies in the universe. However, scientists have yet to detect a single particle of the stuff. They are unsure of its exact nature but calculations suggest that it will be incredibly unreactive and so difficult to detect. DAMPE will therefore look for gamma rays, electrons and high-energy cosmic rays, all of which could hold clues about the nature of dark matter. A similar detector, the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer, is attached to the International Space Station. DAMPE was built by the Chinese Academy of Sciences in collaboration with the University of Geneva, Switzerland, and Italy’s Istituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare.",diasaster:0},

Korean comfort women agreement is a triumph for Japan and the US Read more In a breakthrough that barely seemed possible a few months ago, Japan’s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, offered his “most sincere apologies” to the women in a statement issued in Seoul by his foreign minister, Fumio Kishida. It was not immediately clear if Abe would send a letter of apology to each surviving “comfort woman”. Later Monday, Abe called the South Korean president, Park Geun-hye, who has described the sex slave row as “the biggest obstacle” to improved ties with Tokyo, and reiterated his apology. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Japan’s prime minister Shinzo Abe hails the agreement between the two countries as ‘a new era’ He told reporters that the agreement was based on his commitment to stop future generations from having to repeatedly apologise. “Japan and South Korea are now entering a new era. We should not drag this problem into the next generation.” Park issued a separate statement saying the deal was the result of her government’s best efforts to resolve the sex slave issue. “I hope the mental pains of the elderly comfort women will be eased,” she said. Japan also offered to set up a new 1bn yen (£5.6m) fund, with the money, paid directly by the government, divided among the 46 former comfort women still alive, most of whom are in their late 80s and early 90s. Japanese PM Shinzo Abe stops short of new apology in war anniversary speech Read more Speaking after make-or-break talks with his South Korean counterpart, Yun Byung-se, Kishida heralded a new era of better relations between the two countries, whose strong trade ties and military alliances with the US have been overshadowed by the controversy. “This marks the beginning of a new era of Japan-South Korea ties,” he told reporters. “I think the agreement we reached is historic and is a groundbreaking achievement. “[Abe] expresses anew his most sincere apologies and remorse to all the women who underwent immeasurable and painful experiences and suffered incurable physical and psychological wounds as comfort women.” The Japanese government also conceded that its military authorities played a role in the sexual enslavement of the women. While avoiding any admission of legal responsibility, Kishida’s statement said: “The issue of comfort women, with an involvement of the Japanese military authorities at that time, was a grave affront to the honour and dignity of large numbers of women, and the government of Japan is painfully aware of responsibilities from this perspective.” Abe and other conservative politicians in Japan had previously questioned whether the Japanese government and military played any role in coercing the women, arguing that they had been procured by private brokers. Both countries said the agreement would resolve the issue “finally and irreversibly”, adding that they would refrain from making critical remarks on the subject at the United Nations and in other international forums. Yun said Seoul would cooperate, as long as Japan followed through on its promises. He also suggested that South Korea was willing to negotiate the removal of a statue of a girl symbolising the comfort women that stands outside the Japanese embassy in Seoul. Although the statue belongs to privately run campaign groups, Yun said the South Korean government would “strive to solve this issue in an appropriate manner through taking measures such as consulting with related organisations”. There is disagreement on the exact number of women forced into prostitution by Japan during its 1910-1945 colonial rule of the Korean peninsula. Campaigners say as many as 200,000 women – mostly Koreans, but also Chinese, south-east Asians and a small number of Japanese and Europeans – were forced or tricked into working in military brothels between 1932 and Japan’s defeat in 1945. Most women took their secret to the grave. South Korean Kim Hak-soon became the first to testify about her experiences in public in 1991. “We must record these sins that were forced upon us,” she said. South Korea has long called on Japan to issue an official apology, pay compensation to the surviving women and recognise its legal responsibility. Japan stopped short of admitting legal responsibility and stressed that the new fund was a humanitarian gesture. The Japanese government initially denied the existence of wartime brothels. But in 1993, the then chief cabinet secretary, Yohei Kono, acknowledged and apologised for the first time for Japan’s use of sex slaves. Over the years, Japan has refused to directly compensate the women, saying all claims were settled in a 1965 treaty that restored diplomatic ties and included more than $800m in grants and loans to South Korea. In 1995, it set up the privately run Asian women’s fund, which drew on private donations. But many women refused money unless it came directly from the Japanese state. Only about 260 former sex slaves received cash – worth about 2m yen each – and the fund was disbanded in 2007. The agreement reached on Monday will be welcomed by the US, which has urged its two east Asian allies to settle their differences over second world war history and show a united front in the face of an increasingly assertive China and a nuclear-armed North Korea. In Beijing, the foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang said: “We hope to see an improvement of the bilateral relationship between the Japanese and South Korean side.” Hiroka Shoji, an east Asia researcher at Amnesty International, said: “Today’s agreement must not mark the end of the road in securing justice for the hundreds of thousands [of] women who suffered due to Japan’s military sexual slavery system. “The women were missing from the negotiation table and they must not be sold short in a deal that is more about political expediency than justice. Until the women get the full and unreserved apology from the Japanese government for the crimes committed against them, the fight for justice goes on.” The spread of frontline brothels coincided with Japan’s military campaigns in large parts of China and south-east Asia. As colonial ruler of the Korean peninsula, Japan was able to target poor and uneducated victims, typically aged between 13 and 19. Speculation that a comfort women agreement was in the offing had risen following a bilateral meeting between Abe and Park in early November, their first for three-and-a-half years, and the decision by a South Korean court to acquit a Japanese journalist accused of defaming Park. The South Korean president had voiced hope that a deal would be reached by the end of this year, 50 years after the establishment of diplomatic relations between Seoul and Tokyo.",diasaster:0},

A new report into disposable incomes highlights how lower spending on essentials in 2015 meant Britons were able to buy more luxury items like jewellery and watches as well as spending more on their homes and gardens. 2016 will be a year of living dangerously for the global economy Read more But the latest Asda income tracker also suggested the rapid improvement in household budgets for much of this year started to level off in November. The average UK household had £193 a week of discretionary income in November, up by £14 a week on a year earlier, according to the monthly report into money leftover after taxes and the cost of essentials like groceries, transport and fuel bills. It was the 13th straight month of double-digit growth in disposable incomes but the £14 extra spending boost fell short of the £17 average seen during the rest of 2015, thanks to a slight increase in inflation.

Words That Change the World is a 400-page compilation of Vladimir Putin’s most notable speeches, and has been sent out to all Russian MPs and other political figures as a gift from the presidential administration ahead of the country’s new year holiday. Anton Volodin of the pro-Kremlin youth group Network, which published the book, told the Guardian: “A year ago we noticed when reading one of his early speeches that it was exactly right in its predictions, so we decided to check all of his other speeches. And it turns out basically everything he said has either already come true or is in the process of coming true at this very moment.” Put on some Putin: Russian president inspires new perfume Read more There are 19 articles and speeches collected in the book, starting from 2003 and ending with Putin’s speech to the UN general assembly earlier this year. Volodin said: “If you read through them all, you can see a clear pattern in his rhetoric and thoughts. A lot of people say he’s unpredictable or untruthful, but actually everything he says is transparent, clear and fully formed.” Volodin declined to say where the funding for the book came from but Network is believed to have links to the presidential administration. The manifesto on the organisation’s website describes it as a group of young people who believe Putin is a collective father figure for Russians. It says: “We are together with the father, at one with him. We do not fight against the power of the father; we share it, we learn to use it, and together with the father we direct its energy towards our present and future.” Putin’s spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Monday that he had no idea who was behind the book and was hearing about it for the first time. However, the newspaper RBK reported that last week the first deputy head of Putin’s administration, Vyacheslav Volodin, chaired a meeting in the Kremlin during which he spoke about the book and said it should be on the table of every politician. “We decided to show a copy to people in the presidential administration and they liked it so much they asked us for copies,” said Anton Volodin, who declined to comment on whether he was any relation to Vyacheslav Volodin. He said the group had provided over 1,000 copies to the presidential administration for distribution. The book’s cover features a grainy portrait of the Russian president overlaid with short random phrases such as: “They beat us and we get stronger”, “Russia is my whole life” and “I drink kefir.” “You’d think it would be like Mao’s Little Red Book and it turns out to be total postmodernism,” wrote political analyst Ekaterina Schulmann on Facebook. “It looks like one of those online tests: the first three things your brain picks out characterise your state of mind.” Inside, key quotes in the speeches are marked in bold, and each text is also annotated with comments from the book’s authors. The introduction to the first speech in the book, from the 2003 UN general assembly, notes that Putin was correct to predict chaos in international affairs if the UN and other institutions of international law are ignored. Let Putin be your fitness inspiration hero Read more “If those who had been present at the UN general assembly had listened to Putin’s words, the world would be a very different place. Hundreds of thousands of people would still be alive and Europe would not be full of refugees from the middle east.” The general public will be able to get their hands on a copy of the book in late January, said Volodin, at a price of about 800 roubles (£7.40). Putin has been president of Russia since 2000, save for the years between 2008 and 2012 when he was prime minister but still the most powerful figure in the country. He finishes his latest six-year term in 2018 and is widely expected to stand again. Despite a worsening economic situation, his popularity ratings in the country are at an all-time high, and there are increasing signs of a nascent cult of personality around the leader. T-shirts, mugs and fridge magnets bearing his image are on sale at shops and airports across the country, while there was even a Putin-inspired perfume launched earlier this month. The parfumier behind the scent described it as “soft but at the same time very firm”.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"New year reshuffle by Jeremy Corbyn could spark further Labour conflict", "content": "A Labour reshuffle is expected next week with the party leader, Jeremy Corbyn, believed to be planning changes to gain greater control of his frontbench. It is understood Corbyn wants the party to speak with one voice on matters relating to defence and military intervention abroad after recent divisions, most notably over policy on Syria. Calls for Labour to split are indulgent when the priority is to engage voters | Marc Stears Read more Hilary Benn, the shadow foreign secretary, and Maria Eagle, the shadow defence secretary, are seen as vulnerable in any reshuffle, though other figures could also be affected. However, any attempt to remove either could result in a damaging conflict across the parliamentary Labour party and could result in resignations from the shadow cabinet, according to one shadow cabinet source. Corbyn’s unilateralist and anti-military intervention beliefs were a key feature of his leadership campaign. Eagle is at risk because she is a staunch defender of Trident, while Benn’s position is being seen as problematic because he strongly supported military intervention against Islamic State in Syria after Corbyn spoke out against it. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Hilary Benn’s speech to the Commons on 2 December. The reshuffle is due in the new year, although claims that Monday 4 January has already been pencilled in as the day for it to happen have been discounted, as have claims that Corbyn has already decided to appoint Diane Abbott as the new shadow foreign secretary or to replace Rosie Winterton, the chief whip, with the Corbyn loyalist Jon Trickett. The full scale of the reshuffle has not been decided. Corbyn’s main concern is said to be ensuring the party has a coherent voice on questions relating to the deployment of British power abroad, but he may well go further than just reallocating defence or foreign affairs. Corbyn accepts that his first shadow cabinet was put together quickly. His allies also believe that the Labour split over foreign policy has overshadowed the extent to which the shadow cabinet is united on economic and domestic matters. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, recently said: “On domestic politics, there is virtually nothing between us [members of the shadow cabinet], absolutely nothing, other than some want to go faster than others.” One party source said that Labour’s leader is receiving conflicting advice from his closest confidantes as to whether to launch a major reshuffle. “Some want to go all out for a hard-left agenda now. Others want to try and take the party with him. But if Benn or Eagle go [from the cabinet], others might follow,” the source said. Another speculated that this might be the ideal time to bring back the former party leader Ed Miliband to the shadow cabinet. “Jeremy wants Ed back. If Ed was persuaded to return to energy, it would give an open the door to a reshuffle without all the focus being on the losers,” the party figure added. Sources close to Miliband have downplayed any speculation that he might rejoin the shadow cabinet in January. A source close to Benn said he did not know of any plans for a reshuffle and has been concentrating on helping constituents whose lives have been devastated by the floods. Corbyn is due back in the UK from a holiday in Malta and returned to a new analysis at the weekend suggesting Labour is making little progress under his leadership. According to the academics Colin Rallings and Michael Thrasher, the country’s most prominent local election experts, Labour has been performing poorly in local council byelections since Corbyn became leader in September. There have been 60 such contests in England and Wales, according to the Rallings/Thrasher research published in the Sunday Times. Labour made four gains, but suffered three loses. But Rallings and Thrasher say the picture looks worse when you consider the 27 byelections where a seat was being contested that was last contested in May, on the day of the general election. This allows a direct comparison with Labour’s performance at the election. The Observer view on Jeremy Corbyn’s first 100 days as Labour leader | editorial Read more “Labour’s vote share was up in eight [of these 27 wards], but down in 19,” they write. On average, the Tory share in these byelections is unchanged; Labour is down by four percentage points; the Liberal Democrats’ share is up by seven and Ukip is fractionally down. “While most of the byelections have not been in natural Labour territory, any downward drift compared with the general election is bad news and there is no evidence of a Corbyn bounce.” But Rallings and Thrasher acknowledge that Labour is doing better in London under Corbyn. In the six council byelections in the capital since he became leader (seats last contested in 2014) Labour is on average up three points. Rallings and Thrasher say, on current voting trends, they would expect Labour to lose 200 of the 1,200 council seats it will be defending in the May local elections.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Unruffled Yorkshire spirit dominates, but there's anger too in flooded homes", "content": "Paddling an inflatable boat down Walmgate in York on Monday, the rescuers called out to Pat Harrington. “You OK up there, love?” they asked, having spotted her head poking through the net curtains of a first floor flat. “I’m absolutely fine!” trilled the 74-year-old. “I’ve got power, I’m nice and warm, I’ve got plenty of food left over from Christmas. It’s like luxury camping.” Harrington had no intention of leaving the flat she has lived in for 13 years, she said, but would simply wait for the flood waters to subside. She wasn’t the only resident of Walmgate staying resolutely put, despite the street’s transformation into a slightly whiffy Venice after the river Foss flooded for the first time in living memory. From a window opposite, Geoffrey Beacon said he was taking advantage of his enforced confinement. “I’m a very messy person so I’ve been tidying up,” he shouted down. Neither resident seemed particularly enraged that their road had flooded after the Foss barrier, built at a cost of £3.3m, was opened after the electrics failed. According to the Environment Agency, the electrical controls were broken after the pumping capacity – 32,000 litres per second – was exceeded during heavy rainfall on Boxing Day. The result: the semi-submersion of several hundred properties which never normally flood when the bigger river Ouse breaks its banks (a fairly regular occurrence in York). Facebook Twitter Pinterest Pat Harrington stayed in her first floor flat after flooding on Walmgate. Photograph: Christopher Thomond for the Guardian Beacon blamed not the Environment Agency, but climate change – or, more accurately, the humans who cause the planet to warm. “To stop this happening, really we need to stop eating beef, driving cars and building buildings out of steel and concrete,” he bellowed from his first floor perch. Law student Georgia Bijster, 25, had only moved into her Fossgate house the Monday before Christmas. “Would you believe we moved because our last property had damp?” she said with a grim laugh, as she surveyed the warped floor of her living room, which had ballooned by several feet as the water rose through the floorboards. “When we were looking at this place, the estate agent said to us: ‘don’t worry, the Foss never floods!’” Standing at the edge of the flood waters, Leighann Walton was sanguine, despite her six-month-old Mercedes floating outside the Walmgate house where she had been spending the festive period with her son and husband. The family had to evacuate in the early hours of Sunday morning after the Foss invaded their bedrooms. “I came out just with knickers on my bottom half,” said Walton, who manages an optician’s in Doncaster. On Monday she gave rescuers her car keys and politely asked them to rummage around inside the vehicle to see if they could find her house keys or work security pass. They duly obliged. Sebastian Hyatt, the chaplain of 2 Duke of Lancaster’s regiment, one of three regiments deployed to deliver flood relief across the north of England, praised the residents of York. “The attitude of the civilians has been absolutely brilliant,” he said, beaming after hitching a lift across flooded Walmgate with the water rescuers. The 1,000 troops have witnessed some marvellous scenes, he said: “There was one lady who was stuck at the bottom on her Stannah stairlift after the electrics failed who tried to get the troops to rescue someone else before her.” Despite the overwhelming stoicism, there was also some anger in the city. Chris Wardle was one resident chosen to meet David Cameron when the prime minister donned his wellies for a flood tour on Monday. Wardle’s first floor flat has been repeatedly hit by flooding. The impact on local business was abysmal, he said, adding that the knock-on effect of the flooding was “like stepping back 100 years”. “Someone, from the prime minister to the council, really needs to sort out flood defences in the city centre. Every time there is heavy rain parts flood. Everything we see now is reactive, the cost of insurance alone will be tens if not millions of pounds; think how that could be better spent,” he said. Wardle wondered whether York would receive the same attention as the south-east. Judith Blake, leader of Leeds city council, has said people are concerned that a north-south divide exists in the approach to flood defence spending. “My perception is that if this happened in London there would be an absolute outcry,” said Wardle. “I would like to think this is going to be taken as seriously. The prime minister has said there will be a review but that’s going to take time and we need measures in the meantime to keep us safe.” Around 500 properties in York have been flooded out, according to York city council. “It’s far worse than in 2012,” said a spokeswoman. “Then we didn’t even have 100 properties affected.” At least 200 people had to be rescued by boat on Sunday and Monday, according to Ian Hugill from Scarborough and Ryedale Mountain Rescue, which was coordinating the relief effort. Mountain rescue teams had come from all over the country to help, including a team from Mytholmroyd, which was itself devastated by the weekend flooding, and others from Wales, the Lake District, Plymouth and Dartmouth.

Just pop your laundry in this bag and we’ll bring it back clean and dry tomorrow,” they said on notes at Archbishop Holgate’s school, which had opened as a rescue centre. Outside the school, the Whitby scampi truck turned up to feed volunteers, and a chap from Bridlington had been dishing out free hot drinks from his van. Elsewhere in the city, there was poor mobile phone reception and no internet, which knocked out most cash machines and credit card readers.

{ "title":"Saudi Arabia reveals cuts plan to shrink $98bn budget deficit", "content": "Saudi Arabia has announced plans to cut government spending and reform its finances after plunging oil prices resulted in a record annual budget deficit of nearly $98bn (£66bn). The state ran a deficit of 367bn riyals ($97.9bn) in 2015, or 15% of gross domestic product, officials said. The 2016 budget plan aims to cut that to 326bn riyals, reducing pressure on Riyadh to pay its bills by liquidating assets held abroad. The 2016 budget, released by the finance ministry on Monday, marked the biggest shake-up to economic policy in the world’s top crude exporter for more than a decade, and includes politically sensitive reforms from which authorities previously shied away. The plan suggests the kingdom is not counting on a major recovery of oil prices any time soon but is instead preparing for a multi-year period of cheap oil. The International Monetary Fund warned in October that Riyadh would run out of money within five years if it did not tighten its belt. Oil price slump turns Saudi surplus into huge deficit, IMF report shows Read more Saudi Arabia’s public finances benefited from increases in oil prices after 2003 and the world’s biggest crude exporter was running a budget surplus of 12% of GDP as recently as 2012. “Our economy has the potential to meet challenges,” King Salman said in a speech, adding that the 2016 budget launched a phase in which his kingdom would diversify its revenues. Next year’s budget projects spending of 840bn riyals, down from 975bn riyals actually spent this year. The finance ministry said it would review government projects to make them more efficient and ensure they were necessary and affordable. Revenues next year are forecast at 514bn riyals, down from 608bn riyals in 2015. The Brent oil price averaged about $54 a barrel this year but is now about $37. The success or failure of the budget plan will be key to maintaining the confidence of financial markets in Riyadh. As the deficit has swelled, the riyal has dropped in the forwards market to its lowest since 1999 because of fears that Riyadh may eventually have to abandon its peg to the US dollar. In its budget statement, the finance ministry said it would adjust subsidies for water, electricity and petroleum products over the next five years. That is a politically sensitive step, since the kingdom has traditionally kept domestic prices at some of the lowest levels in the world as a social welfare measure. Any changes will aim to make energy use more efficient and conserve natural resources, while minimising the negative effects on lower- and middle-income Saudis, the ministry said. It also outlined other reforms including “privatising a range of sectors and economic activities”, although it did not give details. The government plans to introduce VAT in coordination with other countries in the region, and raise taxes on soft drinks and tobacco, the ministry said, without giving a timeline.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"After a bumpy year, can China still drive Jaguar Land Rover forward?", "content": "Su Weiping marches into Beijing’s biggest Jaguar Land Rover showroom wearing a thick gold chain and an ear-to-ear grin. “I’ve bought this one,” said the 58-year-old businessman, pointing to a bright red Discovery Sport. He has just laid down 408,000 yuan (£42,000) for the British off-roader. “It’s for my daughter. She loves this brand!” Su said, as he inspected his purchase. “Everyone dreams of having one.” Selling the western consumer dream to the freshly minted middle class in China has helped propel Jaguar Land Rover’s (JLR) sales in the country from just a few hundred vehicles a decade ago to tens of thousands a year. That success prompted JLR to open its first factory in China last year in a £1bn joint venture with state-owned carmaker Chery to capitalise on the burgeoning appetite for its range of 4x4s, luxury saloons and sports cars. But more recently, sales of its upmarket “Chelsea tractors” have begun to slow dramatically in line with a slowdown in the Chinese economy. China was still JLR’s fastest growing market in 2014. However, as Beijing attempts to shift the country from an export-led economy to a more western-style consumer and services-led one, it has not been plain sailing. China’s economy grew at an annual rate of 6.9% in the third quarter of 2015, the slowest since the global financial crisis. That was well below the 11.7% rates the country was achieving during the industrial boom years of 2003 to 2007. It is also below Beijing’s official 7% target. With less cash sloshing around the economy, consumers have applied the brakes on spending. To compound matters, the JLR was hit by a one-off charge of £245m to cover the cost of a chemical explosion at Tianjin port in August, which damaged or destroyed up to 5,800 of its vehicles. In November, the carmaker warned that this year’s pre-tax profits would be lower than last, owing to some large investments in the business and losses from the explosion. It also launched a review of its costs that could lead to £4.5bn of spending being cut. JLR posted a pre-tax loss of £157m for the second quarter of 2015/16, hurt by falling sales in China and weighed down by the blast charge. It also led Tata Motors, JLR’s Indian parent company, to record a net loss for the period. Ralf Speth, chief executive of JLR, has said he does not expect to match the £2.61bn pre-tax profit the British carmaker made in 2014-15. “We will have this year a lower profit number than last year,” he said. “It’s [because of] the investments number and this ... very special event in China.” JLR directly employs 37,000 people worldwide. In addition, 210,000 UK jobs are supported through the supply chain and wider economy. It has factories in Halewood near Liverpool, and in the West Midlands at Castle Bromwich, Solihull and Wolverhampton, where it has a new engine manufacturing centre that JLR has committed to double in size, taking its investment in the factory to £1bn. The carmaker is unrecognisable from the business that Ford sold for £1.15bn in 2008 to Tata Group, the Indian conglomerate that also owns Tetley and the former Corus steelmaker. Under Tata, JLR has more than doubled staff numbers, opened new manufacturing plants and launched a range of new vehicles. The popularity of its Evoque and Range Rover off-roaders in the US and Russia as well as China has underpinned more than £11bn of investments by JLR over the past five years. As well as rebuilding its UK manufacturing base, JLR has opened overseas factories to keep pace with demand. Besides China, it also produces vehicles in the conglomerate’s home country India and is to begin production in Brazil next year. It has also agreed to build a £1bn plant in western Slovakia, which will employ about 2,800 people and produce up to 300,000 vehicles over the next decade. Jaguar Land Rover's £1bn factory in Slovakia 'could threaten UK jobs' Read more In the first half of JLR’s current financial year, China accounted for 18.7% of net retail sales, compared with 27.7% in the same period a year ago. As sales fall in the world’s second biggest economy, the carmaker has moved up a gear in other regions. In November, it sold 46,547 Jaguars and Land Rovers worldwide. The company sold 313,205 vehicles in the first eight months of the current financial year - up 6% on the same period a year ago. Sales have soared 23% in the UK, 35% in the rest of Europe and 28% in North America. But in China they are down 28% so far this year. The softer economy is making it tougher for Jiang Tongbing, marketing director at China’s flagship JLR store in Beijing, to drum up new business. He fondly recalls the showroom almost doubling sales in the four years between 2009 and 2014. “In 2013, we sold about 1,500 vehicles, compared with around 800 in 2009,” he said. Jiang reckons this boom in interest in the British marque was the result of its association with the British royal family. The royal link grabbed the attention of wealthy Chinese customers. “If something is of the royal standard, it means the quality is credible,” he said. “What’s more, if it is royal standard, it represents a noble concept of living. It is also a symbol of your social status. Many businessmen like it.” At the entrance to Jiang’s swish showroom, customers are welcomed by posters of a cigar-smoking Winston Churchill and the Queen Mother, standing beside Land Rovers. But even the royal connection is not enough to keep sales motoring now that China’s economy is stuck in second gear. “We are also feeling pressure on the number of sales,” said Jiang, who expects his showroom to shift 1,800 cars next year – the same number as in 2014. He is right to be cautious about the outlook, but Speth reckons JLR may be about to turn a corner in the world’s biggest car market. “We see that growth is coming back to China and therefore we are cautiously optimistic,” the JLR chief said in November. Whatever the outcome, nothing can dampen Su’s enthusiasm for the British brand. The businessman currently drives a BMW, but said his next acquisition would be a Land Rover – for himself this time.

{ "title":"IRA leader Michael Collins developed his guerrilla strategy in Wales", "content": "Your report (Welsh village summons ghosts of Ireland’s revolutionary past, 28 December) says Michael Collins was a military strategist when he was imprisoned in the Frongoch internment camp in the aftermath of the 1916 rising in Dublin. Collins had spent his previous work life in a variety of office jobs, mostly in London, including a stint as a counter clerk in the post office in Olympia. He returned to Ireland early in 1916, and that year’s uprising was his first military endeavour. I would suggest that it was in Frongoch, the “university of the revolution”, that Collins honed his military expertise and his leadership abilities developed. His criticism of the “blood sacrifice” nature of the rising, with its hope that the martyred deaths of the leaders would provoke a general uprising, was the impetus for his development of a guerrilla war campaign, which eventually proved successful in getting Britain to the negotiating table. It was his spy network that underpinned Collins’ success; there was little of political and military significance happening in Ireland that he wasn’t aware of.

{ "title":"Ethical spending rose in 2014 but solar cuts could hit this year's figures", "content": "Stronger sales of solar panels, electric cars and free-range poultry helped to grow the UK’s overall “ethical market” by 8% in 2014, a new report claims. However, the report’s authors warned that recent government changes such as cuts to subsidies for householders installing rooftop solar panels would make it tougher to repeat this growth in spending on low carbon home energy and cars. The overall value of sales for a sector that spans charity shops, vegetarian food and energy efficient lightbulbs, rose to £38bn in 2014 from £35bn the previous year, according to the latest to the ethical consumer markets report from the magazine Ethical Consumer and Triodos Bank. “Disappointing changes to government incentives for home renewable energy installations and lower impact motoring in 2015 will threaten the strong growth in sales of lower carbon choices identified in this report,” said Rob Harrison, editor of Ethical Consumer. “Successive reports have shown that government incentives to encourage ethical behaviours can bring the most dramatic changes in consumer impacts and should be used more rather than less.” Earlier this month it emerged the government had decided to cut subsidies to householders installing rooftop solar panels by 65% just days after agreeing to move to a low-carbon energy future at the climate change conference in Paris. A second subsidy scheme known as the renewables obligation has also been cut for small-scale and large projects angering both the solar industry and environmentalists. What do 'corporate values' actually mean? An interactive dictionary Read more There has also been anger among campaigners over chancellor George Osborne’s changes to vehicle excise duty that make driving more expensive for those driving smaller, clean cars. The latest ethical spending report shows a 40% leap in sales of electric, hybrid and other cars in the A-rated tax band to £7bn in 2014. Spending on solar panels rose by nearly 25% to £716m. There was a 9% rise in bicycle sales to £956m. The report found there was no growth in local shopping in 2014 but there was a 4% rise in charity shop sales. The authors highlight the first ever fall in Fairtrade sales since the launch 20 years ago of the scheme to offer developing world farmers a minimum price. Fairtrade sales fell 4% to £1.6bn against the backdrop of tighter household budgets and rising market share for discount supermarkets in the UK. That finding echoes previous figures released by the Fairtrade foundation. The ethical spending report commented: “There is no simple explanation, but rather a range of likely factors including falling sales at the Co-op and Sainsbury’s, Fairtrade’s biggest supporters in the retail sector, [and] rising sales at Aldi and Lidl which have smaller Fairtrade ranges.” The ethical food sector grew overall, however, with a revival in organic sales and strong growth in sustainable fish sales, which rose 12% in 2014. Free range poultry sales rose 8% and free range egg sales rose 2%. The value of money held ethically fell by 2%, largely caused by accounts being closed or moved from the Co-operative Bank.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"China Telecom shares fall after chairman held in corruption crackdown", "content": "Shares in China Telecom dropped as much as 3% on Monday after the state-owned company’s chairman became the latest high-profile target of Beijing’s corruption crackdown. The firm, one of China’s big three telecoms operators, saw its shares fall in Hong Kong after it emerged that Chang Xiaobing was being investigated for “severe disciplinary violations”. The wording used in the announcement by China’s central commission for discipline inspection, the watchdog of the ruling Communist Party, is normally the euphemism for corruption. Chang had been “taken away”, according to an article in the respected business magazine Caijing, adding that he disappeared just days before a meeting of the state-owned company planned for Monday. Chang’s phone was switched off and he had not responded to multiple calls, it added. “Since last year, when the authorities were probing oil companies, we knew they would be doing this for other sectors. Now it’s telecoms,” financial analyst Jackson Wong from the brokerage firm Simsen Financial group told AFP. The shares traded were down 3% in early trade in Hong Kong but the drop had narrowed to 1% by the lunch break, with shares trading at HK$3.69. Wong said investors are moving cautiously pending further details of the probe. Authorities have been pursuing a hard-hitting campaign against allegedly crooked officials since Xi Jinping became president in 2013, a crusade that some experts have called a political purge. After a stock market rout this summer, the nation’s financial sector was under the spotlight with several high-level executives reportedly being hauled in. Billionaire Guo Guangchang, dubbed China’s Warren Buffett, disappeared from public view earlier this month amid reports he had been detained by police in Shanghai. He briefly resurfaced afterwards but his conglomerate flagship, Fosun, confirmed the 48-year-old was “assisting in certain investigations” by Chinese authorities. This is not the first wave of investigations to hit the telecoms industry. The country also probed the top three operators in 2010 and 2011, forcing mid-level executives and above to surrender their passports.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"The therapy that taught me – slowly – how to help myself", "content": "“I just worry about not having gained anything,” I mumbled anxiously at my therapist during our final session together in June this year. “Maybe it takes a while to truly know what you have gained from this experience,” she replied. After two years of weekly meetings, copious amounts of sullied tissues, hours of talking, silence and contemplation all in the same tiny room overlooking the Thames, I couldn’t quite sense what I was taking away. The rewards of the experience didn’t await me neatly wrapped with a tag addressed to a newly well version of myself. The real gift I received through undertaking counselling was slow in the making. The ability to realise what had been given and received in the work we had undertaken together was similarly slow in revealing itself. The gift: small acts of kindness change the world for the better | Chibundu Onuzo Read more I began therapy, rather unwillingly, halfway through my English literature degree at King’s College London, in the midst of an all-consuming depression. I had entered university confident, clever and keen, eager to learn more about the literature that I loved. Yet I instantly felt that I didn’t fit in. Rather than finding my feet and forging new friendships in an exciting city I was losing sleep, losing my confidence and losing my sense of self. I was unable to speak to my peers, go to the pub, or carry out any basic social interaction without an intense feeling of fear and anxiety. The effect on my personal life was huge. I retreated and hid between library shelves, buried myself in books and locked myself in my bedroom. My debut poetry book had just been published, but I was declining gigs, terrified that I could no longer perform with my usual exuberance. When a kind and concerned tutor referred me to counselling, I was initially sceptical and reluctant. My fear of speaking to people had become so all-consuming that the thought of being “forced” to talk in a confined space for 50 minutes a week with another human being was beyond contemplation. The first sessions lived up to my expectations. I was guarded, mute and disengaged from the process out of a fear of what it might reveal. But slowly, like the cranes on the South Bank I watched from the window, I began to build a rapport with my counsellor and grew more willing to talk and engage openly with the process of counselling. The sessions gave me new ways of viewing my life, new coping mechanisms for enduring every socially awkward evening at the pub, but more importantly they gave me a new perspective on what gift-giving and receiving might look like. Unable to cope with my life as it was and unable to see the way to solve the situation for myself, I had gone into therapy with the wish to just scream “Please fix me!” at the nearest trained therapist. But through the process of counselling I learned that the point of the exercise was not to be given all the answers, but to be offered a safe, contained space in which I could develop and grow, aided by my counsellor. The benefits I took from the experience were not handed to me by an all-knowing, problem-solving professional while I sat passively receiving them. They were worked for through collaboration and effort, strain and failure. They were the product of a symbiotic relationship, united in the purpose of thinking (and feeling) through the problems I was facing. Counselling gave me my life back, a life I slowly began to want to live again. It also helped me to get my voice back, which I now use often and buoyantly, as I perform poems about feminism and my struggles with depression. Don’t be Sad: how to beat seasonal affective disorder | Norman E Rosenthal Read more My counsellor had been right. Counselling didn’t “fix” all the problems in my life. There are still days when getting out of bed feels like an impossibility, when talking to strangers feels too scary. Through counselling I learned to accept that the process of thinking and feeling better about myself was a gradual one; one that didn’t have to provide all the answers at once; one not about being given a solution but slowly realising the internal gifts and qualities I already had but had lost within myself. Realising just how much I had gained from therapy took a long time. I realise it every time I feel incapable of getting out of bed but do anyway. Every time I feel on the edge of things and yet somehow still finish my to-do list for the day. And every single time I stand up in front of a crowd and perform a poem. The transformative and restorative effect of my time in therapy wasn’t in fact a gift given to me, but one I helped to give myself.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"The BBC licence fee and political interference", "content": "It hardly takes Mark Thompson’s intervention to make the point that the BBC is bearing part of the cost of the government’s social policy (BBC is paying for Tory policy says ex-chief, 24 December). In agreeing to the government’s pressure to take on the cost of free licences for over-75s the BBC is, in effect, helping the Tories to boost their vote with the wealthy pensioner and, at the same time, appearing to be helpful to the working poor by continuing to give tax credits (at least until universal credit becomes widely introduced). For the government this is a case of having your cake and eating it. BBC freedoms and the TV licence fee deal | Letters Read more Having just reached the age of 75 I intend to send a cheque to the BBC for my licence fee. I hope that other readers in my position will do the same and that the Guardian will campaign for a change in policy by the government. David Rowe Newcastle upon Tyne • Following on from Mark Thompson’s just critique, I would add that if our government thinks it is correct to force the BBC to bear the cost of free licence fees for the over-75s, using the same logic, why does it not force the energy companies to bear the cost of the winter fuel payment? Frank Dux Cirencester, Gloucestershire • The suggestion that the government’s decision to make the BBC pay for older people’s broadcasting licences amounts to making the BBC pay for Tory welfare policy is both accurate and useful. Mark Thompson’s suggestion is profoundly political but it is not party political. It is shrewd analysis. Perhaps the little-known Hansard Society should award Thompson a prize and in the process gain some much-needed PR. Peter Draper London • I reserve some of my waking hours for worrying about a resurgent Sky/Murdoch. Replying to surveys and inquiries about the BBC doesn’t quite settle my mind. It occurs to me that if the BBC is to pay licence fees for those of us over 75 years old, there is no reason why Sky should not be required to provide a free service to the same people. Care would be needed to ensure that the free service was worth having, so that it would have to include a fair amount of sport and film, not just tired repeats of CSI, football from the 1990s and straight-to-video films. But if a national enterprise can afford it, a profit-making business can do so all the more easily. (I should perhaps add that I don’t write in my own interest; I’m not 75, and wouldn’t want Sky even for free.)

{ "title":"To pay for the floods, we should raid military spending, not foreign aid", "content": "It is a neat calculation: the first estimates of the end-of-year flood damage in the north of England suggested a bill of a little over £1bn. Or, as sections of the rightwing press maintained, pretty much the same as the UK spends on help for the world’s “20 most corrupt countries”. Cue indignation from the diehard opponents of the 0.7% of GDP that is currently earmarked for overseas aid. A woeful response to flooding as the climate crisis hits home | Letters Read more And if you are among those whose homes have been inundated over Christmas, and you’ve learned that requests for improved flood defences were turned down by Westminster, you might well agree. The money is there, you would say; it is just a question of redirecting it from maladministered projects and ministerial Mercedes abroad to nice, clean, value-for-money schemes here. Charity begins – does it not? – at home? Well, yes – and no. The proportion of GDP that the UK has earmarked for foreign aid spending may be higher than that allocated by many other countries, but it is still tiny in real terms. If, as was reported towards the end of the last financial year, ministers and civil servants were casting around for worthy recipients because they faced the dire prospect – in departmental terms – of under-spending, then that reflects not the lavishness of the budget, but a failure of organisation and imagination on their part. This year, at least, there should be no such difficulty: the cost of what is said to have been the biggest flow of people since the second world war should absorb any surplus there might be in the UK aid budget. Whether the money helps to fund camps in the affected regions, or the cost of processing, accommodating and integrating all the refugees reaching Europe, this seems an entirely valid use of our aid budget – it being a reasonable combination of altruism and self-interest. There is a legitimate discussion to be had about the long-term value of foreign aid generally – how far it prevents countries developing their own resources and reforming themselves; whether it actually fosters dependency and corruption. The distinction sometimes made between emergency relief (essential) and long-term assistance (dubious) has merit and could lead to a beneficial change of approach. But the argument that the UK’s overseas aid budget should be raided to repair flood damage, whether in Cumbria, or Yorkshire, or last year in the West Country, makes no sense. Even if the costs reach £5bn, as has been suggested, it is a minute fraction of the estimated £750bn public spending tally for 2015, and it will be shared, as it should be in any developed country, with commercial insurers. We need a Dutch-style Delta plan to stem the tide of floods | Henk van Klaveren Read more Facebook Twitter Pinterest Properties need to be waterproofed against flooding, Environment Agency warns – audio The Environment Agency may be right, that a complete rethinking of flood defences is needed. How about starting with the sub-stations built on vulnerable sites, and the housebuilding (still, disgracefully) allowed on flood plains? It also makes sense to redirect some resources – but not from the aid budget. One of the successes of the emergency flood operation – in practical and PR terms – has been the involvement of the army. The numbers are not huge: 300 troops are there, another 200 have been sent, and 1,000 are on standby. But you can see the confidence they inspire in those being rescued; the order they bring to some of the relief efforts; the sense they generate that something is being done. As at London 2012, when the army was sent in to make up for the spectacular failure of Olympic security “outsourcing” to G4S, people like to see the army helping out on the home front. In the aftermath of the Iraq debacle, there was concern among the top brass about the breakdown of the “military covenant”: the presumed solidarity between civilians and the military. More frequent deployment of the army in domestic emergencies might not satisfy those who joined primarily to fight, but it can do wonders for civilian-military relations and could encourage recruitment to the reserve. The army’s contribution this Christmas also raises another question: might the UK today benefit from a highly trained civilian Home Guard, part-professional, part-volunteer? Defence chiefs will no doubt say that the military is overstretched as it is. But the answer here should be obvious: less Syria; more Kendal and Hebden Bridge.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Ellsworth Kelly obituary", "content": "The American abstract artist Ellsworth Kelly, who has died aged 92, created sharply defined compositions that were, at least initially, linked to his visual experiences – “a window, or a fragment of a piece of architecture, or someone’s legs ...” In the early 1950s, his style anticipated the unbroken colours and clear lines of hard edge painting by some years. Although he was associated with a number of movements, including minimalism in the 1960s, Kelly remained resolutely independent, combining his austere sense of form with a unique, sunstruck palette. Kelly was born in Newburgh, New York, though he spent much of his childhood in New Jersey. His father, Allan, who initially worked for the army, eventually settled down into insurance, while his mother, Florence, a former teacher, exerted a stronger influence. As well as encouraging her son’s lifelong interest in ornithology, she gave him an inspiring art book when he was in his teens, though she later disapproved of his career choice. He reached adulthood during the second world war, and, after a technical education at the Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, served in a camouflage battalion in Maryland and Tennessee before joining the allied forces in France – an extraordinary first taste of the country and its culture. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Works by Ellsworth Kelly on display at the Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres and Ellsworth Kelly exhibition preview at Villa Medici in Rome in 2010. Photograph: Elisabetta Villa/Getty At the end of the war, Kelly began his artistic education, which was paid for by the state under the GI bill. Even more important than his classical training from 1946 until 1948 at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston were the six years he spent immediately afterwards in Paris, where he met European luminaries such as Jean Arp, Constantin Brancusi and Joan Miró, as well as the fellow Americans John Cage, Merce Cunningham and Alexander Calder. During this period, Kelly rapidly moved from the naturalism of his striking Self-Portrait With Thorn of 1947 through a series of hieratic, expressionistic figures to almost entirely abstract, often monochrome paintings. Many of his works are modelled on architectural fragments: Mandorla, of 1949, derives from the upper facade of the 12th-century cathedral in Poitiers, while the shadows of railings on steps determined the pattern of the La Combe series of 1950-51. Kelly described how, when visiting the Museum of Modern Art in Paris in 1949, he was influenced more by the windows than by the images that hung between them. The resulting drawing led to a highly abstracted picture consisting of two canvases, one reversed and the other painted white, inside a black frame. It is an early example of Kelly’s multipanelled compositions, which were partly inspired by Renaissance polyptychs, especially Matthias Grünewald’s Isenheim altarpiece. But they were intended above all to emphasise their own material rather than representational or expressive qualities. As Kelly put it, they are simply “objects, unsigned, anonymous”. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Ellsworth Kelly’s Sculpture for a Large Wall at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City in 2004. Photograph: Andrew Gombert/EPA Many of Kelly’s works from this time reflect the innovations of older, heroic figures in the French art world. The post-cubist Antibes is named after the town with the Picasso museum, which Kelly visited in 1949; the black-and-white stripes of Cité (1951) were arranged in an arbitrary way, partly based on a dream and reflecting surrealist procedures. This emphasis on the accidental also inspired the painting Spectrum Colors Arranged By Chance (1951-53) and the “exquisite corpse” drawings made in 1950 with Ralph Coburn, an expatriate friend from Boston. By the end of his stay in France, Kelly had created some classic compositions of coloured rectangles with repeated modular forms, as in Red Yellow Blue White and Black with White Border (1952-53). But success and prosperity eluded him. He took a variety of jobs, from art teacher and night-watchman to textile designer, before suffering an attack of jaundice in 1954. He decided it was time to go home. On his return to the US, Kelly moved into the Coenties Slip area of lower Manhattan, close to artists such as Agnes Martin and Robert Indiana, in a culture that was quite different from the abstract expressionists’ aggressively male, heterosexual milieu. Kelly’s work ranged from ink drawings based on the changing shadows inside a moving bus to remarkable abstract paintings – black or coloured forms floating effortlessly against a white margin, or, from the mid-60s, panels joined together to create complex, three-dimensional shapes. Luminous effects were created with a range of hues, often subtly different from primary colours and applied in several layers, while pigments from one area of a painting were mixed with those in another so that the different zones would relate to each other. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Ellsworth Kelly in his Broad Street studio, New York, in 1956. Photograph: © Onni Saari His fame was developed by his relationships with the Betty Parsons and Sidney Janis galleries, and he was frequently associated with fashionable contemporaries such as the hard edge painters, who included his friend Jack Youngerman. Kelly was also linked to minimal art, though his approach was quite distinct from that of Frank Stella, who bluntly declared “what you see is what you see”. In contrast, Kelly’s brilliant canvases created rich pictorial effects, especially when seen against the white walls of a modernist interior, while some works played sophisticated perceptual games akin to those of op art. In Red Green (1968), for example, the suggestion of depth is complicated by an area of the painting projects towards the viewer in a recessive green hue. Other pieces made specific references to external objects or events. Yellow With Red Triangle (1973, now at the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington DC) drew on Kelly’s longstanding interest in architecture, in this case the relationship between a dormer window and a roof he could see from his studio. Such images also express Kelly’s belief in the elusiveness of visual reality, the constantly changing configurations perceptible in everyday life. “I want to capture some of that mystery in my work,” he said. For all his chromatic intensity, Kelly was not averse to using duller tones for specific expressive or visual effects. His grey panel paintings in the mid-70s conveyed his own reactions to the war in Vietnam; Diagonal With Curve XIV (1982) is a dark sheet of weathering steel, inspired by one of his ornithological enthusiasms, the flight of the black skimmer, as depicted by the 19th-century illustrator John James Audubon. During the 70s and 80s, Kelly produced many spectacular sculptures from steel and other metals, often for outdoor settings. Although he had first made wall reliefs from coloured aluminium panels in the 50s, his most ambitious early projects, notably the Statue of Liberty surrounded by gigantic abstract forms, could hardly be realised except in collage. However, after Kelly moved to Spencertown, in upstate New York, in 1970, he was able to set up a number of large pieces with characteristic curved edges in his own garden, as well as outside the Connecticut home of the architect Philip Johnson. Later commissions, including works for Barcelona including the totem-like structure in Plaza del General Moragues (1987), were even more monumental in scale and significance. Kelly’s interest in articulating sensitive public spaces also led him to create powerful compositions for the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, DC (1993), and, in 1998, for the Deutscher Bundestag in Berlin and the US courthouse in Boston. His versatility was displayed not only in his use of materials ranging from fibreglass to aluminium, but also by the way in which he responded to different physical and emotional contexts. The undisputed importance of Kelly to postwar abstract art led to a series of prestigious exhibitions, from the retrospective organised by Diane Waldman at the Guggenheim Museum, New York, in 1996, to an intimate show six years later at the Pompidou Centre, Paris, which juxtaposed Kelly’s refined, even austere plant drawings with more fluid examples by Henri Matisse. Acquisitions of Kelly’s work were made in 1999 by the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, where many of the artworks mentioned here are located, and four years later by the Menil Collection in Houston. Other galleries commissioned site-specific objects, including White Curve, Kelly’s largest wall sculpture, for Renzo Piano’s Modern Wing at the Art Institute of Chicago (2005). From the point of view of architectural integration, a particularly impressive achievement was Blue Black (2001), an 8 metre high aluminium panel in Tadao Ando’s Pulitzer Foundation for the Arts in St Louis. In its tones and proportions it is a fine complement to Ando’s architecture, exemplifying Kelly’s desire to create pictorial effects that involve the whole of the setting. Such works typify his achievement, enhancing the viewer’s experience of his or her surroundings, while expanding the role of abstract art beyond its familiar expressive and formal functions. Kelly was made a Chevalier de l’Ordre des Arts et des Lettres in 1988, Chevalier de la Legion d’Honneur in 1993 and Commandeur des Arts et des Lettres in 2002. In 2013 he was awarded the US National Medal of Arts. He is survived by his husband, Jack Shear, and a brother, David. • Ellsworth Kelly, painter and sculptor, born 31 May 1923; died 27 December 2015",diasaster:0},

Except I couldn’t – the buses were long since cancelled, and my plan to do everything on foot was now foiled too, with community support officers explaining that all roads to Fulford were now flooded, even pathways, and my only hope was a taxi that could take me via the A64.

{ "title":"Ireland may not get Apple's €13bn back taxes in full, EU says", "content": "Ireland may never see the full €13bn (£10.8bn) in unpaid taxes owed by Apple, the European commission has said, if other EU countries go after the American tech giant for a share. The EU executive also said Apple could reduce its multibillion-euro tax bill to Ireland if it increased payments to its US parent company, as it revealed the full text of its landmark ruling against the US tech giant for the first time. Margrethe Vestager, the EU competition commissioner, suggested Ireland may not see the full €13bn in back taxes if Apple chose to pay larger amounts to its US headquarters to fund research and development. Speaking to the Irish Independent, she said the total paid to Ireland could be reduced because other EU member states may demand more tax from Apple if they concluded that the US tech firm had underpaid them, because it had been routing profits to Apple’s Irish headquarters in Cork. The full text of the EU’s decision, published on Monday, sets the stage for a titanic legal battle, which pits the European commission against Apple and Dublin, with implications for hundreds of companies. In August, the commission said a sweetheart deal devised by the Irish government had allowed Apple to pay tax of just 0.005% in 2014 and an average rate of 1% over many years. Speaking on Monday, Vestager said the full amount may not be payable to Ireland. Apple created two companies in Ireland, Apple Sales International and Apple Operations Europe, as it went on a journey to become the biggest profit-making firm in the world. “The amount to be paid back to Ireland would also be reduced if the two companies were required to pay larger amounts of money to their US parent company to fund the research and development efforts,” Vestager said. The Apple tax ruling – what this means for Ireland, tax and multinationals Read more However, she also suggested other EU member states may want a slice. “Other countries, in the EU or elsewhere, can look at our investigation. If they conclude that Apple should have recorded its sales in those countries instead of Ireland, they could require Apple to pay more tax locally. That would reduce the amount to be paid back to Ireland,” she said. Earlier in the year, the Danish politician said Ireland had given Apple a sweetheart deal worth €13bn. But the full 130-page ruling was only published on Monday, to allow lawyers to ensure confidential commercial information was kept out of the final report. Hours ahead of publication, Dublin and Apple stepped up their war of words, vowing to fight the commission in court. As it announced plans to lodge its appeal this week, Apple accused European regulators of a political crusade against a successful American company. In a personal attack on the Danish competition commissioner, a senior company executive said Apple was a convenient target for an official chasing headlines. The company’s chief general counsel, Bruce Sewell, told Reuters: “Apple is not an outlier in any sense that matters to the law. Apple is a convenient target because it generates lots of headlines. It allows the commissioner to become Dane of the year for 2016,” he said, referring to the title accorded by Danish newspaper Berlingske last month. Under Vestager, the commission has also taken on McDonald’s, Starbucks and Italy’s Fiat over tax, and launched investigations into overcharging by Gazprom, one of Russia’s most powerful companies. In a submission to Europe’s second-highest court, Apple also accused the commission of ignoring Ireland’s tax experts. “The Irish have put in an expert opinion from an incredibly well-respected Irish tax lawyer,” Sewell said. “The commission not only didn’t attack that – didn’t argue with it, as far as we know – they probably didn’t even read it. Because there is no reference [in the EU decision] whatsoever.” Apple’s combatative stance comes as no surprise – earlier in the year, the Apple chief executive, Tim Cook, dismissed the case as “total political crap”. Apple has already agreed to pay €318m to the Italian authorities to settle a case of suspected fraud, where it failed to declare its earnings between 2008 and 2013. Ireland is expected to create a €13bn escrow account to store the money, pending potential claims by other member states. Only national tax authorities can decide whether they wish to pursue Apple for taxes on profits booked in Ireland. While Brussels is confident it will win its case, the Irish government accused the commission of riding roughshod over Ireland’s sovereignty, by trying to rewrite the country’s corporation tax rules. Unveiling its formal legal submission on Monday, the finance department described how low taxes are the point of its sales pitch to foreign investors, arguing it was perfectly legal to levy far less tax on profits than imposed by competitors. Under EU rules, governments have powers to set their own corporate tax rates, but are forbidden from giving an unfair competitive advantage to firms on their territory. Ireland levies a tax rate of 12.5%, one of the lowest in the EU, nearly a third of the US rate of 35%. Irish ministers have stressed its low corporate tax rate is non-negotiable, viewing it as the linchpin of the economy. The low headline rate, combined with complex use of shell companies, has helped Ireland to draw in scores of tech and pharmaceutical firms. Apple employs 6,000 people in Cork, Ireland’s second city, and has pledged to remain loyal to the city it chose as its European base more than 30 years ago. Ireland’s finance ministry contended that the commission had misunderstood EU competition rules, which are intended to ensure a level-playing field across the union. “The state aid rules by their nature cannot remedy mismatches between tax systems on a global level,” it said, contesting the EU’s argument that Apple got benefits denied to other companies based in Ireland. Vestager made clear the commission was standing its ground: “This decision sends a clear message: member states cannot give unfair tax benefits to selected companies. No matter if they are European or foreign, large or small, part of a group or not.”",diasaster:0},

This cause touches a deep chord – not just pity, but revulsion and national shame at Britain’s no-room-at-the-inn slamming the door on children. The readers wanted to talk too. There was goodwill, yes, but forget seasonal joy, woe was the refrain. What has become of us, what will become of our children and grandchildren? How did our world turn upside down in 2016 and leave us with no hope? It was becoming a wailathon. Everything liberal and left that people feel they have striven for all their lives seems suddenly to have been grubbed up by the roots and rejected. The dark world of Brexit, and the yet darker coming Trump universe, have snuffed out our sense of history. One woman said she was almost glad her husband hadn’t lived to see this year. All that’s left is individual acts of kindness, giving to charity, embracing like-minded people in mutual wretchedness, but we had little comfort to offer one another. Had they been listening in, how those angry Brexit perpetrators – Michael Gove, Boris Johnson, Iain Duncan Smith, Liam Fox, Rupert Murdoch, Paul Dacre and the rest – would have scorned all this “remoaning”. Christmas cards this year – all cheery robins and grinning snowmen on the outside – come with handwritten messages inside keening the same despair: can it get worse? Yes, next year will be darker still. The seven deadly things we’re doing to trash the planet (and human life with it) | John Vidal Read more We lament the loss of any glimpse of Jerusalem the golden. Callers who rang to offer what they could – some spare cash here, a winter fuel allowance there – talked on Saturday about a lifelong belief in progress. We were taught that history was an onward march: things would always get better. There were backward steps – wars, the depression, the Thatcher years – but surely the path to improvement and enlightenment would be found again. History was reassuringly inevitable: factory acts, banning boys up chimneys, the universal franchise, trade union rights, Lloyd George’s 1911 people’s budget, Beveridge, Roosevelt’s New Deal and its British incarnation in 1945. Attlee gave us not just the NHS and social security but helped the birth of Nato, the UN and a postwar consensus that saw Macmillan build 300,000 homes a year, mostly council houses. Edward Heath took us into Europe and opened out a little our island mentality. The advantages seemed obvious: holidays, football teams, Erasmus, free trade, MEPs together in one European parliament must mean friendship with neighbours so like us in culture, history and democratic purpose. European differences are endlessly interesting, but vanishingly small when we look outside at the rest of the world. Look how refugees fleeing despots and those touched by civil wars seek Europe as a haven of human rights, peace and democracy. This was ours; this is what we have just rejected, spurring ripples of rejection across the continent. If there was a moment’s hope that Donald Trump would be muzzled by wise advisers, we have seen it dissipate with each new appointment.

More frightening will be the inevitable clash between these turkey-cocks. Back home, there will be six years of cuts, grinding one public service after another. There have been four prison riots already. Social care is collapsing, as private companies withdraw from care homes: half the homes owned by the biggest five have been rated “unsatisfactory”. Already 1.2 million older people are left with care needs unmet, a silent suffering. But there will be no silence from the NHS, entering its harshest spending year yet, facing the mass closure of maternity and A&E units. Come next April, there will be £13bn benefit cuts poleaxing the incomes of millions of low-paid families: lone mothers will lose 18% in the universal credit squeeze by 2020. Disabled people are being reassessed for reduced personal independence payments; already 230,000 have had them cut, including 57% of psychosis sufferers. There will be disruption as strikes – still minimal by historical standards – are called to safeguard jobs, with over a million gone from public service. Ministers and the press will condemn them, but do we want a world of automata, with no one in post offices, stations or trains; no one keeping our parks, minding playgrounds, patrolling or sweeping the streets? Schools will take an 8% funding cut per pupil next year, laying off teachers. Meanwhile we will wonder why we score so badly on international tables. The drumbeat for crushing the last breath out of the unions is only resisted by No 10 because even ministers fear it presages a post-Brexit abolition of all working rights. But those rights are being torn up anyway by Amazon-style gig employers who designate their workers as self-employed. Inflation is flagged at 4% next year, with real wages falling behind yet again.

Nothing “works for everyone” in any of this, and in every month that Theresa May seems unable to shape or lead anything, stuff will happen willynilly.

Newspaper columns are supposed to end with solutions, but I’m running low on hope.

{ "title":"Why killing of Russian diplomat may well bring Turkey and Russia closer", "content": "The high-profile murder of a Russian diplomat in Ankara has inspired fearful comparisons with the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand in 1914 – and prompted some to speculate that Monday’s killing could also provide the spark for a regional conflagration. But Turkish and Russian leaders moved rapidly to contain any damage to relations between the two countries, and analysts said that Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and Vladimir Putin are likely to find common ground in the desire to assign blame to their perceived strategic adversaries. Russian ambassador to Turkey shot dead in Ankara art gallery Read more Both Ankara and the Kremlin announced that a meeting of foreign and defence ministers from Russia, Turkey and Iran to discuss the three allies’ next steps in Syria is to go ahead as planned in Moscow. Erdoğan called Putin to discuss the killing of Andrei Karlov and said afterwards they had agreed that “our cooperation and solidarity fighting terrorism should be even stronger”. Mustafa Akyol, a Turkish commentator, said Erdoğan and Putin will each want to point the finger at their perceived antagonists. “Both sides believe in a western conspiracy to set them against each other,” he said. Diplomatic analysts said that neither leader had an incentive to disrupt a loose accord they have reached over Syria, allowing each to pursue their war aims. Turkey has ensured that its incursion into northern Syria did nothing to weaken the siege on Aleppo by Russian and pro-Assad forces. Meanwhile, Moscow is widely believed to have given its assent to Turkish ambitions to take the northern Syrian town of al-Bab, to further its aim of blocking the consolidation of a Kurdish ministate, Rojava, on Turkey’s southern flank. “Russia and Turkey have every incentive to manage this crisis. The forced evacuation of Aleppo aids in Russia’s war effort, while Turkey has won Russian acquiescence to its efforts in [al-Bab] – which is intended to blunt Kurdish expansionism,” said Aaron Stein, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council thinktank. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Russian ambassador to Turkey shot dead in Ankara art gallery He added that the assassination is likely to make bilateral ties more asymmetrical than they already are. “Russia has always had the upper hand. This just makes it stronger,” he said. Turkey and Russia both alleged a broader conspiracy behind Monday’s shooting. Turkey’s prime minister, Binali Yıldırım, referred to “dark forces” operating behind the assassin. Putin referred to Karlov’s assassination as a “provocation” aimed at derailing Russo-Turkish ties, using a common codeword for conspiracy by Moscow’s foreign enemies. Pro-government commentators in both countries were quick to suggest there must be unseen western hands behind the killing, echoing Putin’s and Erdoğan’s conspiratorial world views. A Russian senator, Frantz Klintsevich, claimed it was “highly likely that representatives of foreign Nato secret service are behind” Karlov’s killing. Another senator, Alexei Pushkov, blamed “political and media hysteria” sown by Russia’s enemies, and tweeted that “the key question is who is behind the assassination and therefore an undeclared war on Russia”. Erdoğan’s supporters started broadcasting a theory that the assassin was a supporter of Erdoğan’s political enemy Fethullah Gülen, a Turkish cleric living in exile in the US. The Turkish president has blamed Gülenists for a July coup attempt against him, using the claim as justification for arrests of ten of thousands of alleged Gülen supporters in the government, military, judiciary and press. Turkish calls for his extradition are a major cause of friction in bilateral relations with the US. Sinan Ülgen, a former Turkish diplomat now at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said the killing in Ankara will not cause the same crisis in relations triggered by the Turkish shooting down of a Russian warplane along the Syrian border in November 2015. “This time around, there is no willingness on either side to escalate. On the contrary, first official statements tend to view this attack as an attempt to derail the ongoing rapprochement between Ankara and Moscow,” Ülgen said. “Going forward, Moscow will nonetheless want a thorough investigation into the nature of the attack so as to identify the culprits. It remains to be seen whether this was a lone wolf attack or the doing of a more organised jihadist cell that has infiltrated Turkish law enforcement.” Maxim Suchkov, an expert on the Middle East at the Russian International Affairs Council, agreed that there is no political incentive in either Moscow or Ankara to turn the killing into a wider crisis, and argued that fearful comparisons with the assassination of Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo more than a century ago were misplaced. “Russia and Turkey have recently had substantial contacts on the senior military and political level,” Suchkov said. “Troublesome parallels with the beginning of the first world war are in the air but if Erdoğan manages to carry out timely and effective crisis diplomacy with Putin, there may be no serious consequences for the state of the bilateral relationship ... Too much is at stake for both Moscow and Ankara right now.”",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"European commission approves Drax biomass subsidy", "content": "The share price of Britain’s biggest power station operator has jumped to a five-month high after the European commission approved subsidies for its conversion to burn wood pellets instead of coal. Drax was awarded a renewable energy subsidy contract by the government in 2014 to switch the third unit of its coal power station in North Yorkshire over to biomass. That prompted a state-aid investigation by the commission, which was concerned the estimates of the plant’s performance were too generous and Drax would be overcompensated. On Monday the investigation cleared the subsidy, which sees a guaranteed price paid for electricity generated by the plant. The commission said its analysis found the support would “not result in overcompensation” and would not unduly distort the wood market that will supply the plant with 2.4m tonnes of pellets a year. Protesters criticise Drax over use of subsidies for coal and wood power Read more The approval comes at the end of a year that has seen coal power drop to a record low in the UK – down two thirds on 2015 – as environmental policies have shuttered several major coal plants. Ministers have said the country’s last coal power station will close in 2025 to meet climate targets. Dorothy Thompson, CEO at Drax Group, said: “We are pleased the European commission has completed its review of the contract and approved it in line with our expectations. We now look forward to fully converting the unit to run on sustainable biomass.” But the company is still looking for financial support to convert the fourth of its six units to biomass, which the government has previously said is ineligible for subsidies. “With the right conditions, we can do even more,” said Thompson. “This announcement is hugely welcome, if a long time coming,” said local Conservative MEP, Amjad Bashir, who added that the power station would play an important role in climate targets. But green groups questioned the climate change credibility of burning wood pellets which are largely sourced from US forests. “Big environmental question marks continue to loom over biomass and whether it is in fact renewable on this scale. Biomass has been classified indiscriminately as a ‘zero carbon’ energy source but this stems from flaws in the way the EU and US account for carbon,” said Susan Shaw, a lawyer at the NGO ClientEarth. Drax Group shares rose to a high of 356.2p on Monday, just below their highest level this year, in July. Company shares soared earlier this month after the company’s bid to buy four gas power stations in a diversification away from its reliance on coal.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"The endless joy of logs", "content": "The garden task that gives me greatest satisfaction is the cutting of our winter wood stack. I like to joke that our logburner consumes only hand-prepared organic “food”, and there is even a sense in which each piece is an individual. Over the years I’ve learned that the secret to preparing logs is not some fancy axe or equipment. It is time. I have thus worked out a four-stage process that spans two years, beginning with the moment when the live trees are felled. They are mainly self-sown sallows that sprang up just after the war on the edge of my four boundary dykes at Blackwater Carr, when the fen was open grazing marsh. Decades of non-intervention allowed them to develop into linear thickets the length of the whole site. Rather than permitting the mature trees to choke the dykes with leaf mulch I clear them off the banks while simultaneously restoring the original flower-rich pasture. Why our hearts go out to Sherwood's ancient oak Read more The fresh timber is stacked at Blackwater, for 6-10 months of seasoning, completed under tarpaulin, when it can be used by breeding solitary wasps or by overwintering ruby tiger moth caterpillars. Then after its transfer to Claxton comes a second rest, when it creates another great invertebrate habitat, especially for woodlouse spiders and a lovely group of moths called flatbodies. Finally comes the log splitting for the woodsheds, when they are cut and restacked for anything up to six months in advance of use. In his book Wildwood, Roger Deakin suggested that he was warmed three times by his logs: when they were felled, while being split and then finally as they burned. I enjoy an imaginative corollary, savouring each piece as I try to recall the circumstances of the cut, how it was subsequently stored and then the moment it was sectioned to fit the fire. By the time it goes through the glass door I have two years of connections. Something about many of the logs – the thickness of the trunk, details in the bark or patterns in the grain – permits me to recognise them in their slow journey to the flames.

{ "title":"Britain’s shame: the people who are homeless, even though they’re in work", "content": "The people you are about to meet are invisible. Politicians don’t mention them. Much of the media ignore them. I can see why. To say such folk exist is to admit that much more is wrong in Britain than the gatekeepers of our national conversation will allow. It’s to accept that some of our prized insights about the economy are junk, and to understand, however fleetingly, how little stands between the rest of us and complete disaster. For all that, they are as real as you or me – and they are fast growing in number. They are people who are homeless, even though they are working. I met some of them last week, at an emergency night shelter in the centre of London. Their jobs are with some of our biggest companies and local councils. At the end of a working day, they come back to this warehouse unit to sleep in a metal bunk bed alongside 42 others. The men share one toilet, women the other. Among the homeless, this counts as a good ticket: Shelter from the Storm provides dinner and breakfast. Around one in three of the people bedding down here are in work. The night I went, the charity’s co-founder, Sheila Scott, looked down the list of guests and identified their employers. It was a roll call of Britain’s consumer economy: Starbucks, Eat, Pret. A woman who travelled three hours to work at a Co-op grocery. Pubs, McDonald’s, a courier for Deliveroo. The former Tory minister George Young described the homeless as “what you step over when you come out of the opera”. No, Sir George: today’s homeless deliver your takeaways and pull pints at the local. Then they kip on park benches. Martin, who works for Islington council taking disabled children to school, told me how he’d spent a month sleeping either in Hampstead Heath or by the canal near London Zoo. “I was exhausted all the time,” he said. Some mornings, he’d knock for the children still clutching the bag that held all his belongings. This month, the charity Shelter calculated that over 170,000 Londoners are homeless. Its researchers pieced together the data for how many were both in a job and in temporary accommodation: it amounts to nearly half (47%) of all homeless households in the capital. Figures like these, and shelters like Scott’s, neatly puncture many of the official boasts about work in post-crash Britain. The ministerial bragging about record employment? That economic miracle would include a third of the people dossing down at Scott’s place. The smugness with which David Cameron talked about the high-tech sharing economy? The Uber driver in that bunk over there might put him right on a few things. All the blether about how strong unions will destroy the economy? The casualised workforce in these improvised dormitories make a good argument for labour protection. Most of all, it proves that two of the hardiest orthodoxies in British politics are now a lie. First, the notion that work pays. That is why Norman Tebbit told men to get on their bikes, why Gordon Brown fiddled about with tax credits, why George Osborne could get away with attacking “skivers”. But minimum wages, zero-hours contracts and a couple of shifts through a temping agency don’t pay. They certainly don’t pay enough to get you decent accommodation in one of the most expensive housing markets on the planet. When that belief dies, so too must its corollary: that the homeless are always unemployed. “Why are beggars despised? For they are despised universally,” asked George Orwell in Down and Out in Paris and London. “It is for the simple reason that they fail to earn a decent living.” None of the people I met were begging, but each lived within the shadow of the idea that by being homeless, they had become despicable. “I’d always thought homelessness was for alcoholics and addicts,” said Liam. The twentysomething had been an engineer on the London Underground before his subcontractor moved on, leaving him short of work and burning through his savings. Now he does shifts in a pub, earning just above minimum wage. It’s not enough. Before coming to the shelter after each closing time, he’d wander the streets. When Euston station opened around 3.30am, he’d creep upstairs and lie down for a few hours. Not that he slept much, for all the crying and worrying. The next day would be spent in a youth centre. His mum would ring. “All I wanted to do was to break down and say, ‘Mam, I’ve lost everything now, I don’t have anything left.’ But if she heard that, it’d break her heart.” Like all the homeless people interviewed here, Liam is a pseudonym. For him to talk to me is to relive his humiliations: his face goes red, he stammers and barely ever catches my eye. Yet for all the shame that laces his story, he did nothing wrong. He just turned up for work. Post-crash Britain punishes workers even as it knights tax-dodging bosses. It applauds zero-hours contracts while it prosecutes begging. It starves those with disabilities into work, knowing the work won’t put food on the table. It trumpets poverty pay as an economic miracle. To be poor in Britain is to be treated by public officials and private managers with jovial contempt. Another guest of Scott’s, Nicola, tells me how her landlady went bust and she was evicted in May. Rather than sleep on the streets, she spent nights sitting in a police station. If she nodded off, the officers would blast hip-hop to wake her up. When she sought funds from Haringey council, she says one officer told her, “You don’t even look homeless.” She claims another directed her to take out a payday loan (Haringey denies both allegations). One job interviewer sussed she was staying in a shelter. He said he’d never seen a homeless person before and demanded: “Give us a twirl.” Nichola works in a warehouse for Greggs, making cakes and cookies. After nearly two years there, she’s still on a temp contract through an agency. No regular hours, just a text when they want her to come in – to which she has to reply promptly or lose the work. The shifts typically start at 6am, which means getting up at 3am and taking three buses. A few weeks ago she slogged across London only for the factory machine to pack up. She was paid for the 2.5 hours it was functioning. When contempt is embedded in the contract, it feeds through to the workplace. At the end of a shift last week, the manager pointed at all the work left over and barked: “You’re not going anywhere.” Greggs says agency staff are generally only employed on a short-term basis. I’ve seen payslips that suggest otherwise. I’ve also seen the company report that boasts of shareholders being paid £43.7m in dividends last year. Nichola, Liam and Martin will all be spending this Christmas homeless. I ask Nichola how she will spend the 25th. She replies: “Sleep all day. I have not had a proper sleep since May.”",diasaster:0},

Photograph: Katherine Anne Rose for the Observer Recommended by Anne Fine, author of Madame Doubtfire, Goggle Eyes and Flour Babies The Frog and Toad books are perfect gifts. Children of three to five adore these wry, intelligent and gentle stories about two very different friends. Frog is patient and modest. Toad is not. But together they face the problems any child will recognise: ice‑creams that melt too fast, an overpowering inability to get out of bed, lost buttons, failure of will power, and all the myriad misunderstandings, anxieties and triumphs of small busy lives. The illustrations are a restful, greeny-brown delight. There’s nothing brash and cartoony about these stories. Though written as simply as fables, the wry humour makes them appeal to a wide age range. No adult I know ever tires of reading them aloud.

Crongton Knights by Alex Wheatle Facebook Twitter Pinterest Nick Shaw Recommended by Nick Shaw, English teacher at Dean Trust Ardwick school, Manchester It’s an old-fashioned adventure story, but set in a modern London estate. The adventure takes place over one night, when the characters go on a mission to the other side of the city. It’s set against the backdrop of a riot – people are looting shops and the town centre is a no-go area. Throughout the book there’s a threat of violence, and it deals with topics such as sexting, which aren’t very well represented in the usual books on the GCSE syllabus. The dialogue and conversations between characters are so vibrant – I have no idea if that’s how young people talk on estates in London, but it felt authentic. I was blown away by one of my pupils’ responses to the book – he went away and made his mum order the earlier story, Liccle Bit. He hadn’t read a book for five years.

The most powerful part of this book is when some creatures called the Ugly-Wuglies, whom the children make out of coathangers and umbrellas and broomsticks, come to life. They have no roofs to their mouths, so when they speak, “Can you recommend me to a good hotel?” comes out as “Aa oo re o me me oo a oo ho el?” It is terrifying yet funny at the same time. The Young Elizabeth by Jean Plaidy Facebook Twitter Pinterest Lucy Worsley. Photograph: David Levenson/Getty Recommended by Lucy Worsley, historian, broadcaster and author of Eliza Rose, a novel about the Tudor Court for readers of 11 and over A classic bit of historical children’s fiction. I’m amazed when I reread it just how closely she followed the Tudor sources. The story starts with a christening procession that saw the future queen watching her baby brother, Edward VI, being taken by torchlight through the galleries of the palace to the ceremony in the Chapel Royal. It was just one of Plaidy’s many historical books with young female protagonists that were catnip to an introverted nine-year-old like me. My own copy, with its picture of Hampton Court Palace on the cover, is undoubtedly one of the reasons I’ve ended up working there as chief curator. A Child of Books by Sam Winston and Oliver Jeffers Simon Smith Recommended by Simon Smith, principal of East Whitby community primary, North Yorkshire school This is a lyrical picture book where we follow a young girl who takes a little boy on an adventure through books. It’s about how fiction opens our minds and opens doors to other places. There are beautiful illustrations combined with extracts from classic literature and lullabies. Even though the text elements of the story are short, there’s a joyous celebration of language within it. The use of classic texts such as Treasure Island has made the children want to explore those books – we’ve had to buy more classic text for our library because of it. The Secret of Nightingale Wood by Lucy Strange Facebook Twitter Pinterest Caroline Ash Recommended by Caroline Ash, deputy head at Haughton Grange primary school, Blyth, Northumberland This book is set in 1919 and it’s about a girl called Henrietta. It’s shrouded in mystery at the beginning so you don’t really know what’s happened, but you know there’s been an accident and that she had a brother who has died, and that they’ve moved away to the country and mum is ill. It’s a real page turner – I finished reading it in one night when my son went to bed. He’s 10 but I would say it’s suitable for children of nine-plus. There are lots of words where my son would ask “what does that mean?” Hell and High Water by Tanya Landman Facebook Twitter Pinterest Alex Wheatle. Photograph: James Drew Turner for the Guardian Recommended by Alex Wheatle, author of Crongton Knights, winner of the Guardian’s 2016 children’s fiction prize It’s a rollicking story, with lots of historical education. The main character’s father is sent away because he’s charged with a theft, and so the son has to prove his father is not guilty. He has to fight the social prejudices of the day – prejudices against poor people – to prove his father is innocent. It shows the injustice of 200 or so years ago for somebody of colour, and it’s about the imbalance of power between rich and poor, and about someone trying to fight against injustice. It’s so relevant to today, and that’s why I really enjoyed it. It’s also very educational – not many people are aware, especially school children today, that black people did exist in north Devon and places like that in the 17th or 18th century. Winter Magic edited by Abi Elphinstone Facebook Twitter Pinterest Jo Clarke Recommended by Jo Clarke, librarian at Whitchurch C of E primary school, Hampshire This is such a lovely mix of historical and contemporary stories and it captures all the excitement of the season – the frozen Thames, wondrous elves. It features people such as Berlie Doherty, Jamila Gavin, Geraldine McCaughrean, so it’s got classic writers, but also lots of contemporary writers. The reason I love short stories is that they introduce children to new authors. Children often get stuck in a rut – “I’m just reading everything by Jacqueline Wilson.” When you give them a short story anthology it opens a whole new world. It’s suitable for a child around seven, or a child a bit older than that could read independently. How the Grinch Stole Christmas! by Dr Seuss Facebook Twitter Pinterest Holly Smale Recommended by Holly Smale, author of teen fiction series Geek Girl I’m a sucker for both rhyming couplets and any “mean person finds joy and love through the magic of Christmas” story, so How The Grinch Stole Christmas! – Dickens with a fluffier antagonist – is in constant demand in my family every December. The jaunty, singsong style of Dr Seuss is entrancing and comforting, especially for children, but it’s the warmth and the heart in this story that make it so unforgettable (along with classic insults like “you have termites in your smile”). No child or adult should go through a winter season without at least one visit to Whoville. Anne of Green Gables by Lucy Maud Montgomery Bansi Kara Recommended by Bansi Kara, assistant headteacher in central London It’s easy to forget the brilliant characterisation in these stories. They’re about a girl who gets into trouble constantly, but her moral development as a character comes about as a result of her making mistakes. She learns to deal with her own vanity and pride. They’re timeless books and the things that she goes through – feelings of loss, abandonment, feeling like you don’t fit in – most young people experience today. Considering it was written in the early 1900s, it’s still incredibly relevant. There’s a remake happening of the TV series, so it’s going to come back into the public eye. A Wizard of Earthsea by Ursula Le Guin Facebook Twitter Pinterest Frank Cottrell Boyce. Photograph: Alamy Recommended by Frank Cottrell Boyce, author of Chitty Chitty Bang Bang Flies Again, Cosmic and Millions It’s about a school for wizards, so that may sound familiar. What is astonishing about the book is that Le Guin’s definition of magic and how it works is strangely convincing. You have to really understand something – to know its real name – before you can control it. The hero, Sparrowhawk, has therefore to find the real name of the shadow that is haunting him. It’s a book full of magic and adventure – it has unquestionably the best map of any fantasy book. But it’s also full of beauty and a wisdom that I still draw on now. It would be the gift that keeps on giving. I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings by Maya Angelou Facebook Twitter Pinterest Floella Benjamin. Photograph: Alicia Canter for the Guardian Recommended by Floella Benjamin, author of Coming to England This book it had a profound effect on me. I believe any child experiencing adversity, rejection or that feeling of not belonging will find solace in this book. It will also make them realise they are not alone, as it covers many of the issues children are facing today. Those who suffer from depression or mental health problems, because of the unhappy situations they have to endure, will find this book will empower them to feel worthy and not to allow events to ruin their life, as it will reassure them that it is not their fault when people behave cruelly. It’s a classic book that inspires readers. It fires up the imagination and takes the reader on an unforgettable journey. Wings! by Paul Stewart, illustrated by Jane Porter Chris Riddell Recommended by Chris Riddell, the Waterstones Children’s Laureate Paul Stewart’s delightful tale of discovering your own special talents, even though they may be different from those around you, is brought to life by Jane Porter’s beautiful collage illustrations. Penguin’s deepest desire has always been to fly but everything goes wrong. It is only when penguin falls into the sea that he discovers a different way to fly. This heart-warming picture book shows children that everyone has something they’re good at. It’s simply a matter of finding what it is. The Secret of the Blue Glass by Tomiko Inui (translated by Ginny Tapley Takemori) Facebook Twitter Pinterest Michael Morpurgo. Photograph: Murdo Macleod for the Guardian Recommended by Michael Morpurgo, children’s author, best known for War Horse, Kensuke’s Kingdom and Private Peaceful I loved this book. Pushkin Children’s Books are to be congratulated in making it available to an English audience. How important it is, in these times, that our children read the stories from other peoples, other cultures, other times. Set in Tokyo just before the second world war, the Little People, Bilbo, Fern and their children, Robin and Iris, live on a shelf in a dusty room full of books and are cared for by the Moriyama family. The Little People have been entrusted to the Moriyamas by an English teacher, Miss MacLachlan, who has to leave Japan after 20 years’ teaching English as the war comes closer. There is a strong sense of place and the changing seasons are beautifully described. While the story has elements of the work of Oscar Wilde and Hans Christian Andersen, the author admits to having been inspired by Kenneth Grahame and Antoine de Saint-Exupéry. Locomotion by Jacqueline Woodson Recommended by Darren Chetty, a teacher and writer and contributor to The Good Immigrant edited by Nikesh Shukla An education book that changed me: favourite reads revealed Read more It’s a short novel, suitable for ages nine- to 13, written as a series of poems. The narrator is Lonnie Motion, an 11-year-old boy whose parents died four years previously in a fire and whom, having spent some time in “group home” now lives with his foster mother, Ms Edna. His teacher encourages him to “write it down before it leaves your brain” and so sets about writing a series of poems through which we learn of his feelings about the loss of his parents, his separation from his sister and the people in his life who show him love. Woodson captures the language of a young African American boy who is determined to make sense of his world. I was struck by how well I felt I knew the other characters in the book just through their appearances in Lonnie’s poems. The warmth and optimism of the book shines through without ever feeling forced. Surely you’re joking, Mr Feynman! by Ralph Leighton and Richard Feynman Dan Abramson Recommended by Dan Abramson, headteacher of King’s College London mathematics school This is a collection of stories about Richard Feynman, one of the greatest physicists of the 20th century. It’s all about how he got into physics and the fun he had doing it. Some stories are more serious – he was involved in developing the nuclear bomb – but a lot are about how he played with concepts and was always open to new ideas. The book challenges the sense that there’s a canon of material one must learn to master the subject – it’s about mindset, creativity and fun. It’s accessible to 15- to 16-year-olds who are interested in physics. Zoo-ology by Joelle Jolivet Recommended by Isabel Thomas, author of Self-Destructing Science: Space Facebook Twitter Pinterest Isabel Thomas Zoo-ology was published the month my eldest child was born, and has been a family favourite for eight years. Each spread is a safari for the senses, crammed with Joelle Jolivet’s striking animal prints. Her artwork is captivating at any age – bold enough to appeal to babies, and beautiful enough to tempt you to tear out and frame the pages. The book is a wonderful way to start talking about biodiversity, but most of all, it’s fun. When my boys were little, they sat on the pages playing animal hide and seek and spotting the hidden chameleons. Now eight, six and four, they gather around to invent their own versions of I Spy and Guess Who? Older children can pore over well-chosen facts about the featured creatures, tucked away at the back. Noughts & Crosses by Malorie Blackman Recommended by Charlene Shaw, writer and teacher at Barnwell school, Hertfordshire Charlene Shaw I’m mixed race and there weren’t any books that appealed to my ethnicity. It was the first book I connected with. It explores the idea of racism by reversing the superior race and having the black community as the ruling class. The main story line is a white boy and a black girl who are friends and they end up falling in love even though the odds are against them. The themes are more prominent in today’s society than ever – you’ve got racism, terrorism, friendship and war. The school I teach in is quite diverse, and when the Black Lives Matter protests were happening over the summer last year, I used this novel to explore the issue more deeply.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"​Scotland Yard spent nearly £5m on three child abuse inquiries in 2015", "content": "Scotland Yard has spent nearly £5m this year on three separate investigations into allegations of historical child sexual abuse by celebrities and politicians, the Guardian can disclose. The Metropolitan police spent nearly £2m this year on its Operation Midland inquiry into claims that a so-called Westminster paedophile ring murdered three boys in the 70s and 80s. The investigation, based on the claims of one key witness known only as Nick, was brought under the control of a new umbrella inquiry in October after failing to uncover evidence that key establishment figures were involved. The cost of Operation Midland was revealed in a freedom of information request by the Guardian which also found that Operation Yewtree, the inquiry into sexual abuse by Jimmy Savile and others, is costing £2.2m a year. A third operation, Fairbank, an umbrella inquiry that is considering whether to launch full-scale investigations into specific allegations, costs £550,000 a year. In total, 83 members of police staff were working on the three inquiries as of 29 September, Scotland Yard said in its response to the FoI request. The disclosure of the £5m-a-year price of the inquiries prompted Nigel Evans, the Tory MP who was cleared of rape and sexual offences in April 2013, to call for full disclosure of the cost of the investigations, whose “track record is incredibly poor”. He said: “There is huge competing demands on police time – we were told before the budget how strapped for cash they were – so someone has to be brave enough to look at the way these investigations are being conducted, whether they are being done in the most economically viable way and if not then scale them back.” While £5m was spent this year on the three inquiries, £10.1m has been spent over four years on Operation Grange, the investigation into the disappearance of Madeleine McCann, which was drastically scaled back from 29 to four officers in October. The Home Office funds that investigation from a special grant budget. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Nigel Evans said police cuts meant a review was needed into how resources were being spent on investigations into historical abuse claims. Photograph: Nigel Roddis/Reuters Scotland Yard’s handling of the historical child abuse investigations has also been questioned. The force admitted it was wrong to have described allegations made by Nick as “credible and true” at the start of Operation Midland last year. The detective who made the remark, DS Kenny McDonald, was relieved of his control of the investigation in October when Operations Midland and Fairbank were brought under a newly formed investigation led by Det Supt Ang Scott. The force’s handling of an investigation into the former Tory home secretary Leon Brittan also sparked recriminations. The detective leading the inquiry, Det Ch Insp Paul Settle, was removed from the case after telling his bosses there were no legal grounds to interview Brittan on suspicion of rape. He was overruled and Brittan was interviewed, only for detectives to conclude there was no evidence to support a reasonable prospect of conviction. Brittan died in January 2015 without being told he had been cleared. Evans called on Scotland Yard to disclose how much it spent on the Brittan investigation before it was shelved. “I think we need to be told on these things because it has a huge impact on the diversion of funds that could be going into fighting Daesh [Islamic State],” he said. “This is money that can’t be spent twice so if you are spending it there in large fashion – as the Guardian’s freedom of information request has demonstrated – then it can’t be spent on fighting Daesh or domestic terrorism in the UK.” Operation Yewtree, launched amid public outrage over Savile’s crimes after he died in 2012, has produced some convictions. Publicist Max Clifford, entertainer Rolf Harris and DJ Dave Lee Travis are among high-profile figures to be convicted of sex crimes. However, others including the broadcaster Paul Gambaccini, presenter Jim Davidson and comedian Freddie Starr have been told they face no further action after being arrested. In December, the DJ Neil Fox was cleared of all charges after six women came forward to make allegations against him. Magistrates said the six alleged victims were believable but that they had taken factors including “context” into their decision. Speaking after Fox’s acquittal, Gambaccini called for Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, the Metropolitan police chief, to resign “in disgrace”. Gambaccini said Hogan-Howe’s “witch-hunt has shamed London and discredited the very profession of policing”. He added: “The Metropolitan police embarked on a mendacious and malevolent witch-hunt that will be remembered by history with the same disdain and derision with which we now recall the witch-hunts in Salem, Massachusetts, and McCarthyism in America. “These unprecedented scenes of police opening a dedicated website, opening a dedicated phone line, going on TV and saying ‘Accuse celebrities, you will be believed’ … It’s time to stop believing Bernard Hogan-Howe and the Crown Prosecution Service.” Gambaccini declined to comment further when contacted by the Guardian.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Rupert Murdoch: 'I've never asked any prime minister for anything'", "content": "Rupert Murdoch has written to the Guardian to deny he ever claimed that Downing Street did his bidding, as an attempt by his US film and television group to acquire Sky is due to be formally notified to ministers. The media mogul, who is chairman of 21st Century Fox, wrote: “I have made it a principle all my life never to ask for anything from any prime minister.” In a rare move to write directly to a newspaper, Murdoch disputed a quote attributed to him in the Guardian and elsewhere in which he reportedly said: “When I go into Downing Street, they do what I say; when I go to Brussels, they take no notice.” Rupert Murdoch: ‘I have never asked for anything from any prime minister’ | Letter Read more In his response, Murdoch added: “There is much fake news published about me, but let me make clear that I have never uttered those words.” The quote was originally reported in the Evening Standard by Anthony Hilton, who wrote in February: “I once asked Rupert Murdoch why he was so opposed to the European Union. ‘That’s easy,’ he replied. ‘When I go into Downing Street they do what I say; when I go to Brussels they take no notice.’” When asked by the Guardian, Hilton said: “I stand by my story.” He said Murdoch made the remarks in a conversation in the early 1980s, when Hilton was city editor of the Times. Hilton, now a columnist for the Evening Standard, has referred to the anecdote several times over the years without either a denial or a complaint from his former boss, until now. The denial from Murdoch comes at a highly sensitive moment for his business interests, with Fox’s proposed £11.2bn takeover of the 61% of Sky he does not already own expected to be notified to the UK government for approval. The culture secretary, Karen Bradley, has 10 working days from being notified to tell Ofcom whether a public interest investigation into the proposed takeover should be launched. The former Labour leader Ed Miliband and former business secretary Vince Cable have called for the takeover to be blocked and referred to the regulator. A previous attempt by a Murdoch company to acquire the remaining part of Sky was withdrawn in the summer of 2011 at the height of the phone-hacking scandal, which was exposed by the Guardian and led to the closure of the News of the World. However, Fox, the company bidding on this occasion, does not own the newspapers; they are published by a separate business, News Corporation. The newspapers were hived off in the wake of the hacking scandal. During the Leveson inquiry, Murdoch made a similar statement about his political influence, saying “I’ve never asked a prime minister for anything in my life” during a day of testimony in April 2012. However, that was contradicted by John Major, the former Conservative prime minister, who told the inquiry shortly after Murdoch gave evidence that while the media mogul “never asked for anything directly from me … he was not averse to pressing for policy changes”. In particular, Major described one meeting in the run-up to the 1997 general election in which Murdoch “made it clear that he disliked my European policies, which he wished me to change. If not, his papers could not and would not support the Conservative government. So far as I recall he made no mention of editorial independence but referred to all his papers as ‘we’.” Major added: “Both Mr Murdoch and I kept our word. I made no change in policy and Mr Murdoch’s titles did indeed oppose the Conservative party. It came as no surprise to me when soon after our meeting the Sun newspaper announced its support for Labour.” The ultimatum, Major said, was delivered at a private meeting three months before that election, which resulted in the Tories losing heavily to Labour. Harold Evans, the former editor of the Times, has also said that a private meeting between Murdoch and the then prime minister Margaret Thatcher over lunch at Chequers, the official country residence, led to a “coup that transformed the relationship between British politics and journalism”. Evans suggested that a deal was brokered at that meeting in which Murdoch offered his papers’ support to Thatcher in return for approval for his purchase of the Times and Sunday Times in 1981. Hilton, while working at the Times, saw a lot of the paper’s proprietor, with dinner in Murdoch’s Green Park flat and conversations in his office in Gray’s Inn Road. The conversations were between owner and employee, not part of a formal interview, so there is unlikely to have been any verbatim note or witnesses. Hilton used the comment in his February column as part of a wider discussion about the nature of the relationship between corporate power and government. That column concludes with an observation about Murdoch’s comments: “That was some years ago but things have not changed that much.”",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Union leader says No 10 demonising working people in strikes row", "content": "The government is “demonising working men and women” by accusing striking staff of having “contempt for ordinary people”, the leader of Britain’s biggest union has said. Don’t complain about the strikers – they’re only doing what we all should in 2017 | Paul Mason Read more Len McCluskey, the Unite leader, was responding to comments made by a Downing Street spokesman about walkouts by rail, air, Post Office and Weetabix workers. Are you taking part in or affected by the UK strikes? Read more Industrial action by Southern rail conductors in the RMT union and a continuing ban on overtime by drivers in the Aslef union were expected to cause further disruption for 300,000 passengers on Monday and Tuesday. Post Office staff who are members of the Communication Workers Union are striking for five days this week, including Christmas Eve, in protest at job losses, the closure of a final salary pension scheme and the franchising of crown post offices. The Post Office said fewer than 300 of its branches would be affected. BA and Virgin Atlantic also face walkouts over Christmas. Members of Unite are due to take action on Christmas Day and Boxing Day in a dispute over pay. BA said it intended to run a full service on both days despite the strikes. Workers at Weetabix have voted to go on strike in the new year in a row over shift patterns. Members of Usdaw, the Union of Shop, Distributive and Allied Workers, backed industrial action by 9-1 on a turnout of almost 70%. Asked about the strikes affecting Southern rail, the Post Office and BA, Theresa May’s deputy official spokesman said on Monday: “What the prime minister thinks is that the strikes are wrong and that they are causing untold misery to hundreds of thousands of people … If [these strikes] have anything in common, it is shared contempt for ordinary people trying to go about their daily lives.” The former cabinet ministers Michael Heseltine and Norman Tebbit are among the senior Tory figures who have called on May to take a tough line on trade unions, following the wave of strikes and threatened walkouts. In response, McCluskey said: “The government should be looking at positive ways to resolve disputes, not demonising working men and women who only consider strike action as the very last resort. “I have never encountered a worker who wants to strike. When they have to take industrial action, it is an expression of frustration at not being heard by employers. I urge the government to concentrate more on understanding why industrial relations break down, not slinging around threats to remove fundamental freedoms.” The shadow transport secretary, Andy McDonald, said the government had the power to end the dispute on the rail network and accused ministers of “promoting ever more draconian responses” to workers’ grievances. “We need to take the heat out of the current situation. It’s vital that the parties agree to take a breath and there be a moratorium to enable some sensible, objective discussions to take place,” he said. He called on both sides to focus on passengers’ safety. “As Southern commuters are well aware, services are delayed, cancelled and overcrowded every day regardless of strike action. For the sake of passengers, the government must take this opportunity to resolve the dispute and sort out Southern’s unacceptable service.” The CWU, which staged a demonstration outside the headquarters of the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills in London, said there was strong backing from the public for its campaign. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Dave Ward, general secretary of the Communication Workers Union, addresses supporters at the London protest. Photograph: Carl Court/Getty Images The union’s general secretary, Dave Ward, claimed that the future of the Post Office was at risk because of the policy of franchising services from crown offices to retail firms such as WHSmith. The Post Office’s network and sales director, Kevin Gilliland, said: “Any action will affect fewer than 300 of our branches, and many of these will be open to maintain services for customers preparing for Christmas. “It will be business as usual in almost all of our network, with over 50,000 Post Office people on hand to support customers as they make their preparations for Christmas.” The dispute does not involve the Royal Mail, whose workers sort and deliver post. BA cabin crew who belong to the Unite union are due to strike on Christmas Day and Boxing Day in a row over pay, although talks were being held at the conciliation service Acas on Monday. Talks are also due to take place on Tuesday to try to avert pay strikes later in the week by Unite members employed by Swissport as baggage handlers and other ground staff at 18 airports. Alex Cruz, BA’s chief executive and chairman, said: “We are making sure that this attempt to ruin Christmas for thousands of our customers fails. Over the weekend, we have been working on detailed contingency plans to ensure that we are able to operate our normal flight programme from all our airports on both Christmas Day and Boxing Day.” Ed Leach, of Usdaw, said of the Weetabix decision: “Despite long and detailed discussions, the company has so far refused to offer a suitable financial incentives for employees who have moved shift or will be expected to move on to the new 24/7 shift pattern. As a result of the failure to agree, Usdaw conducted a ballot for industrial action and members have overwhelmingly backed a series of 24-hour strikes. “It is deeply regrettable that the company has pushed staff to this point and we hope that they will look again at their offer, continue to negotiate with us and seek a solution that will avoid the industrial action backed by our members.” A spokesman for Weetabix said: “We are disappointed by the ballot result, but respect the decision and are keen to continue discussions. We have plans in place to minimise any potential disruption to our operations.”",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Northern Ireland's Arlene Foster survives confidence vote", "content": "Northern Ireland’s first minister, Arlene Foster, has seen off an attempt to remove her from office following a failed green energy scheme costing taxpayers £400m. While 39 assembly members voted for the no-confidence motion versus 36 against, it was still defeated because in order to pass it needed the backing of a majority of nationalist and unionist members. The Social Democratic and Labour party (SDLP) had won cross-party support from unionists, greens and leftwingers for its motion censuring Foster over allegations about the “cash for ash” scandal. The motion of no confidence was supported by a majority of voting MLAs but was defeated because it did not secure the required level of cross-community support, due to the opposition of Foster’s Democratic Unionist party (DUP). While the DUP’s partner in government Sinn Féin also called for Foster to stand down, its members did not vote in the debate. Instead it proposed its own motion on the scandal for mid-January. That move eased fears of an immediate threat to the political institutions, though the crisis is far from over. In an acrimonious three-hour debate in the regional parliament, the Ulster Unionist party leader, Mike Nesbitt, said the scandal had reduced devolution to “collectively a laughing stock”. All the main opposition parties – the Ulster Unionists, the Greens, Traditional Unionist Voice and the leftwing People Before Profit – had backed the SDLP’s move to exclude Foster from Northern Ireland’s highest office. This latest crisis to imperil the power-sharing executive is related to the renewable heating incentive (RHI), a scheme set up in November 2012 to encourage the consumption of heat from renewable sources. It offered huge and, its critics say, inflated financial incentives to farms, businesses and other non-domestic consumers to use biomass boilers that mostly burned wood pellets, as well as solar thermal and heat pumps. A whistleblower in February this year alleged the scheme was being abused and that one farmer at least had actually made £1m out of renting an empty shed. Northern Ireland’s auditor general, Kieran Donnelly, concluded this summer that there was “no upper limit on the amount of energy that would be paid for”. In her 15-page statement to the regional parliament, which opposition parties boycotted by walking out, Foster admitted that it was the “biggest regret” of her political career that there was no cap put on huge payments to those who availed themselves of the energy scheme. The DUP leader stressed that she did “not impose this scheme on the people of Northern Ireland”. Foster told the more than half empty chamber that she did not receive any indication or any “warning signs” that controlling the cost of the scheme was an urgent priority. Later Sinn Féin’s deputy first minister, Martin McGuinness, called on the other parties to back its alternative motion urging Foster to step aside while an independent inquiry was held. “Today we have witnessed a shambles in the assembly. Our institutions should not have to endure another day like this,” McGuinness said. Northern Ireland’s justice minister, Claire Sugden, an independent unionist assembly member, backed the DUP in the vote. “I would kick the house of cards down myself if Northern Ireland didn’t have so much to lose,” Sugden said, adding that she said she not support the motion because it was premature. Last week former Stormont minister Jonathan Bell accused fellow DUP members of delaying the closure of the scheme. Bell also alleged that DUP advisers had tried “cleanse the record” of any links between Foster and the decision-making process that led to the RHI scheme’s creation. The SDLP leader, Colum Eastwood, said the allegations of very serious wrongdoing were “the biggest public finance scandal in the history of devolution”.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"This is the polar bear capital of the world, but the snow has gone", "content": "Churchill, on the banks of the Hudson Bay in Canada, is known as the polar bear capital of the world. Hundreds of bears gather there each year before the sea freezes over in October and November so they can hunt seals again from the ice for the first time since the summer. I first went there 12 years ago at this time of year. The place was white, the temperature was -20C, and the bears were out feeding. Polar bears losing weight as Arctic sea ice melts, Canadian study finds Read more This year I came back to make a film for Danish TV and set up live feeds of the bears. It was so different. In mid-November there was no snow or sea ice or ice; the land was green or brown and the temperature was 2C. The bears were walking around on the land waiting for the ice to form. It was like summer. October had seen unprecedented temperatures all around the Arctic leading to a record-breaking slowdown of sea ice formation. Local people told me they had never seen it like this before. With Geoff York, director of conservation at Polar Bears International, we pored over satellite maps every day. It was shocking. The whole 470,000 sq mile bay was completely ice-free. This is the southernmost colony of polar bears in the world and in the past about 1,000 bears would be there. But studies have shown that in the last 20 years the surface temperature of Hudson Bay has warmed by about 3C. Sea ice extent The fate of Arctic sea ice – Science Weekly podcast Read more This has had a massive effect on the bear. The western Hudson Bay population has declined by more than 20% in 30 years. It’s the same elsewhere. New analysis of data from the southern Beaufort Sea in north-west Canada and Alaska suggest even greater population declines there. We saw about 20 bears around Churchill in the 10 days I was there. That’s actually a few more than I saw last time, when I was there 12 years ago, but that was because most of the bears were out on the ice then. The ones we did see this year appeared thin, restless and hungry, and were starting to be more aggressive. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Lars Ostenfeld and a polar bear in Churchill, Hudson Bay, Canada, November 2016. Photograph: Simon Gee There was a mum and a cub and it was very emotional because it looked pretty certain that the cub would not survive much longer. The days of bears in this region having triplets seem to be over. The declining sea ice has decreased hunting opportunities, so the bears are smaller and fewer cubs are being born in this area. Every year, York told us, the bears spend one day more on land and one day less on the ice. That does not sound much, but it’s one day less hunting, and over 30 years they are getting one months’ less food. Arctic 360: take a tour without doing damage Read more The ice is getting thinner; it’s melting earlier and it’s coming later. New studies suggest that polar bears can only survive for about 180 days on shore. York was clear: “If sea ice loss continues at the same pace or faster than we have seen here over the last 30 years, this is definitely not sustainable and researchers predict polar bears could become regionally extinct by mid- to end of this century.” The polar bear is an icon of climate change. What is happening near Churchill is a clear sign that change is taking place now. When I returned to Europe, the frost finally came. It should have been one month earlier.

Festive sales patterns show that shoppers put their hands in their pockets based on a love of local sportspeople, singers and comedians. Popular purchases in the north include the former Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard’s biography My Story, and DVDs of the sitcom Car Share featuring the Bolton-born comic Peter Kay. Online shoppers in the Midlands snapped up I Believe in Miracles, an account of Brian Clough’s European Cup-winning Nottingham Forest team. They also opted for Alone in the Universe, the 14th album by the Birmingham rock group Electric Light Orchestra. Local bias was equally evident in Wales, where books by two men with the surname Jones topped the bestseller list. Rugby fans bought Bomb: Adam Jones, the prop forward’s autobiography, and the singer Tom Jones’s autobiography Over The Top And Back also flew off the shelves. Northern Ireland also hailed a homegrown hero, buying Bring AP, a documentary by the former jockey AP McCoy.Scots went for a DVD by the comedian Kevin Bridges. Southerners’ tastes were also rooted in their region, but they were mainly interested in food. Deliciously Ella, a healthy eating guide by the London blogger Ella Woodward, did particularly well. The biggest overall Christmas seller at Amazon, which has been criticised for its meagre tax contribution to UK coffers, was the Tottenham-born singer Adele’s album 25. Adele has also faced a backlash over her attitude to tax, after saying in 2011 that she was “mortified” to be paying the 50p higher rate of tax.

It grasps above the skyline, then slinks the southern mountains in a tired arc, like a sentry pacing a watch-wall. During its six-and-a-half-hour march its light barely flickers the vast sky’s threshold. Darkness always seems close. In the rafters of Scotland, this gaping landscape is a peculiar purgatory between mountain and moor, here and somewhere else. Distant peaks, mirages of other places, prowl its perimeter as if pulled apart to make it. People call it the empty quarter. But empty it is not. A smothering tartan of russet, red and green flatland, puddled with peering dubh lochans that catch the sky in them, this is Scotland’s blanket bog. The wet desert, or flow country – from Old Norse floi, wet. You’re closer to Norway here than London, and you feel it. The bog’s both alive and dead. Damp, acidic ground grows sphagnum moss, the living surface of peat bog that deepens by a millimetre of decay a year. It’s unique in scale, perhaps the biggest anywhere. Silence of the Flow Country Read more But December’s mildness has put the bog in an odd, part-numbed half-place. On a shoulder of a hill there’s a pool. It’s frozen, but there is no translucence: it’s matte, like bone. Thin water covers it. Between pillows of sphagnum, your feet find holes in the bog, and thick edges of ice jag your knees as you sink into oil-water that shocks with cold. By day, it feels treacherous. Walk out long after sunset, it’s unsettling. Much is said of the silence here: but on a rough night, there’s no silence. The growl of unchallenged wind strafing knoll and lochan, and of low vegetation battered to a hiss. On a moonless night smothered by cloud, what really gets you is the darkness here. It leans on you, like a thing. Your eyes scramble for light, but deep into an 18-hour night find none. Just an endless, peat-black flat.

{ "title":"Landlords to launch legal challenge to George Osborne's tax relief changes", "content": "A group representing 250 landlords is to launch a court challenge against tax changes to buy to let coming into force in 2017, claiming they have been victimised by the chancellor, George Osborne. The landlords have obtained legal advice from Cherie Blair’s firm, Omnia Strategy, that they have grounds to mount a judicial review of the tax changes, claiming that it breaches human rights legislation and European law. Steve Bolton, who owns £10m worth of residential and commercial property, has linked with popular landlord websites Property Tribes and Property 118 to fight the changes. From 2017, tax relief for buy to let will gradually be cut to a flat rate of 20% compared with the 40% or 45% that some landlords currently enjoy. UK buyers need to save for up to 24 years to get on housing ladder Read more “Not only is this tax grab unfair, undemocratic and underhanded, but we believe that it could also be unlawful,” said Bolton. In the autumn statement the chancellor added an extra 3% stamp duty on buy-to-let purchases, starting in April 2016, saying that, “frankly, people buying a home to let should not be squeezing out families who can’t afford a home to buy.” Landlords campaigning against the tax crackdown have met stiff opposition from groups acting on behalf of young adults and families forced into renting who feel they have been elbowed aside by tax-advantaged landlords. Duncan Stott of Priced Out said: “The reduction in tax relief available on buy-to-let mortgage interest is welcome, as not only is this is an unfair tax perk that is unavailable to ordinary homeowners, but it also encourages landlords to pump more mortgage debt into the housing market.” The Bank of England recently highlighted the risks to the UK’s financial stability from buy to let. Lending to landlords rose 10% in the first nine months of 2015, it said, compared with 0.4% in owner-occupied properties. It said it is reviewing the lending criteria adopted by firms and stands “ready to take action”. Landlords are currently able to buy houses using cheap interest-only mortgages, while first time buyers are required to buy using more expensive repayment loans. Ignore the landlord-martyrs: it’s time for the Bank to intervene over buy-to-let Read more But the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales was critical of the budget changes. Tax manager Anita Monteith said: “The 3% rise in stamp duty land tax for purchasing buy to let and second homes will affect individuals but not it would seem corporate investors. This compounds the complexity already announced in the July budget to cut income tax relief interest paid for financing such properties.” The ICAEW also told Property 118: “Some landlords will pass on their increased tax by increasing rents. Others will be forced to sell, as they will not be in a position to pay the extra tax demanded by HMRC. Homelessness will increase as some tenants will not be able to afford higher rents and many will be evicted by landlords forced to sell.” Bolton, who runs Platinum Property Partners, a specialist buy-to-let business with £200m of homes, said: “The plight of first time buyers is one we understand. But it is wrong to put the blame on leveraged buy-to-let landlords with mortgages. Cash buyers are not affected. What the government is doing is victimising one group of individuals who have mortgages. “Landlords are being demonised when the fundamental problem is that the government has not created enough new homes.” A crowd-funding campaign has been launched to pay the initial £15,000 in legal fees, but Bolton said he expected the cash will be raised swiftly. Formal legal action will then follow in early 2016.",diasaster:0},

The period from May to July brought remorseless rain and low temperatures to Scotland too. However, although the year as a whole was cool in the north (with average temperatures in the south), new high UK temperature records were set in July and November. Provisional figures suggest that December will have been the mildest for centuries in England and Wales. Daytime Temperatures The average Central England Temperature for 2015 was provisionally 10.2C, 0.4C above the 1981-2010 average. The first 11 months of the year were mostly cool in northern parts of the UK, but close to average in the south. In December, mean temperatures were nearly 6C above the 1981-2010 average in a few places in southern England. The average Central England temperature for December was provisionally around 9.5C, 5.4C above average, clearly beating the previous record of 8.1C set in 1934 and 1974. By contrast, northern Scotland was about 2C above average. New UK monthly records were set on 1 July at Heathrow (36.7C, the highest temperature of the year) and on 1 December at Trawscoed in Ceredigion (22.4C). Rainfall The year’s rainfall was dominated by heavy rain over the west of Scotland, north-west England and Snowdonia at times, notably in January, March and December. Scotland had a very unsettled spell between May and late July with very few dry days. The moisture-laden south-westerly winds in December gave exceptional rainfall totals with over 700mm recorded in the Lake District and Snowdonia. Honister Pass, Cumbria, set a new record for 24-hours rainfall in the UK with a total of 341mm in the 24 hours to 6pm on 5 December. In contrast, parts of London and the Home Counties were drier than average between February and June. Sunshine Sunshine for the year was mostly just below average. The sunniest month for the country as a whole was April, especially in the north-west, though in the south-east of England, June was marginally sunnier. May was unsettled and failed to provide the usual sunshine totals, and the next two months continued in a similar vein in north-western parts. September was quite fine and dry, but sunshine was scarce in the last two months of the year due to the persistence of moist south-westerly winds bringing sub-tropical cloud north-east across the North Atlantic.",diasaster:0},

She wrote: “There are those who lament the substitution of text for the handwritten letter, but ‘thanks Gran, u r gr8’, sent in the moment of unwrapping, has a glorious spontaneity and gratitude, which the ritual letter does not.” The 68-year-old’s treatise discussed the minefield of manners but she risked irking some as she mourned that men would now be “greeted with a lecture on equality” if they opened a door for a woman or gave up a seat on a train.

{ "title":"Arctic ice melt 'already affecting weather patterns where you live right now'", "content": "The dramatic melting of Arctic ice is already driving extreme weather that affects hundreds of millions of people across North America, Europe and Asia, leading climate scientists have told the Guardian. Severe “snowmageddon” winters are now strongly linked to soaring polar temperatures, say researchers, with deadly summer heatwaves and torrential floods also probably linked. The scientists now fear the Arctic meltdown has kickstarted abrupt changes in the planet’s swirling atmosphere, bringing extreme weather in heavily populated areas to the boil. The northern ice cap has been shrinking since the 1970s, with global warming driving the loss of about three-quarters of its volume so far. But the recent heat in the Arctic has shocked scientists, with temperatures 33C above average in parts of the Russian Arctic and 20C higher in some other places. In November, ice levels hit a record low, and we are now in “uncharted territory”, said Prof Jennifer Francis, an Arctic climate expert at Rutgers University in the US, who first became interested in the region when she sailed through it on a round-the-world trip in the 1980s. “These rapid changes in the Arctic are affecting weather patterns where you live right now,” she said. “In the past you have had natural variations like El Niño, but they have never happened before in combination with this very warm Arctic, so it is a whole new ball game. “It is inconceivable that this ridiculously warm Arctic would not have an impact on weather patterns in the middle latitudes further south, where so many people live. “It’s safe to say [the hot Arctic] is going to have a big impact, but it’s hard to say exactly how big right now. But we are going to have a lot of very interesting weather – we’re not going to get around that one.” Arctic sea ice loss The area covered by Arctic sea ice at least four years old has decreased from 718,000 sq miles in September 1984 to 42,000 sq miles in September 2016. Older ice tends to be less vulnerable to melting. The age of the ice is indicated by shades ranging from blue-gray for the youngest ice to white for the oldest. Credits: Nasa The chain of events that links the melting Arctic with weather to the south begins with rising global temperatures causing more sea ice to melt. Unlike on the Antarctic continent, melting ice here exposes dark ocean beneath, which absorbs more sunlight than ice and warms further. This feedback loop is why the Arctic is heating up much faster than the rest of the planet. This in turn narrows the temperature difference between the Arctic and lower latitudes, which is crucial because it is the temperature gradient between them that drives the jet stream wind, which streaks around the pole at up to 250mph and about 8km above the surface. The jet stream forms a boundary between the cold north and the warmer south, but the lower temperature difference means the winds are now weaker. This means the jet stream meanders more, with big loops bringing warm air to the frozen north and cold air into warmer southern climes. Furthermore, researchers say, the changes mean the loops can remain stuck over regions for weeks, rather than being blown westwards as in the past. This “blocking” effect means extreme events can unfold. “There have been recent studies showing very plausible physical mechanisms of how rapid warming in the Arctic can influence weather in the mid latitudes, both in summer and winter,” said Dim Coumou at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany. Coumou is a former offshore industry geophysicist who has studied the link between extreme weather events and global warming since 2010. “A couple of years ago this was the main criticism on any such links, that the physics was not well understood,” he said. “But the big question [now] is, how important are these mechanisms?” How Arctic meltdown can lead to extreme weather The other main influence on the jet stream is sea surface temperature in the tropics, which waxes and wanes with El Niño, while solar cycles and even volcanic eruptions have smaller effects. The clearest connection so far between the melting Arctic and weather is for extreme winter conditions, such as the intense winters that hit parts of North America and northern Europe in 2009-10, 2010-11 and 2013-14, causing record snowfalls and billions of dollars of damage. In those years, the jet stream deviated deeply southwards over those regions, pulling down savagely cold air. Prof Adam Scaife, a climate modelling expert at the UK’s Met Office, said the evidence for a link to shrinking Arctic ice was now good: “The consensus points towards that being a real effect.” While downswings of the jet stream can bring freezing winters, the accompanying upswings have been linked to worsening the drought in California. “These northward jet stream swings are of course the reason California is having such a terrible drought,” said Francis. This effect was in fact predicted back in 2004, with those researchers now saying: “Reality is moving faster than we thought or hoped it would.” But the winter extremes can also swing the other way and bring mild but torrential weather, as seen in the past two winters in the UK, leading to severe flooding, said Prof Edward Hanna, at the University of Sheffield in the UK. Facebook Twitter Pinterest 150 years of global warming in a minute-long symphony He pointed to the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), a cyclic variation in air pressure that may be affected by the fast melting of Arctic ice. The variability of the NOA has doubled in the last century, he said: “Within the last decade, there have been wild swings in the NAO values in December.” The connection between the vanishing Arctic ice and extreme summer weather in the northern hemisphere is probable, according to scientists, but not yet as certain as the winter link. Blocking patterns caused by slow-moving meanders of the jet stream have been firmly linked to some devastating events, including the 2010 summer floods in Pakistan, which killed 2,000 people and affected 20 million, and also the searing heatwave in Russia in the same year, which killed 50,000 people and wiped out $15bn (£12bn) of crops. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Villagers stand outside their homes during flash floods on the outskirts of Peshawar, Pakistan, on April 2016. Photograph: Mohammad Sajjad/AP “We also see such summer events more often in recent years,” said Coumou. Blocking events have also been linked to summer deluges in the UK, leading to disastrous flooding in 2007 and 2012 which caused billions of pounds in damage. The year 2012 was also an extreme year for Greenland, with record melting across its entire surface flushing water into the ocean and accelerating sea level rise. The hot loop of air that sat on Greenland that year may also be linked to one of the biggest weather disasters of recent years: Hurricane Sandy, which killed 233 people and cost $75bn in damages. Scientists suspect that the blocking event over Greenland, potentially linked to the record low Arctic ice that summer, prevented the hurricane veering north-east out into the Atlantic like most storms. Instead, blocked by the high pressure, Sandy swung left over the most populated area of the east coast of the US. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Damage caused by Hurricane Sandy in Rodanthe, North Carolina, October 2012. Photograph: Steve Earley/AP Another consequence of the fast melting Arctic raises the possibility that there may be even worse extreme weather to come, according to a few scientists: titanic Atlantic superstorms and hurricanes barreling across Europe. The melting of Greenland ice is pouring about 250bn tonnes a year of fresh water, which is less dense than salty sea water, into the ocean. As a result, the water mass sinks less and the current that drags warm water up the Atlantic is weakened – scientists have already found that the current is at its weakest for a millennium. This means a region of the north Atlantic is becoming relatively cool and this exaggerates the contrast with tropical waters to the south, which is the driver for storms. In the worst case scenario, said the renowned climate scientist Prof James Hansen, this “will drive superstorms, stronger than any in modern times – all hell will break loose in the north Atlantic and neighbouring lands”. Hansen– who was one of the first scientists to alert the world to the dangers of climate change in 1988 and has been arrested more than once outside the White House while protesting against fossil fuel developments – pointed to the historical record as a precedent: 118,000 years ago a superstorm tossed 1,000-tonne mega boulders on to the shores of the Bahamas. Hurricanes will worsen as planet warms and sea levels rise, scientists warn Read more “I would certainly not call such [superstorm] scenarios ridiculous,” said Coumou. “But it is speculative – we don’t have the hard evidence.” But even with what is known so far, there is cause for concern that the complex interactions are turning the slow burn of global temperature rise into sudden weather disasters. “The worrying aspect is that such dynamical changes can occur more abruptly than simple background warming of the climate,” said Coumou. “Dynamical changes can change more rapidly and can therefore lead to surprises and I think there are many such possibilities in the system.” Facebook Twitter Pinterest A polar bear swims in Svalbard. The fjords there would usually be partially covered with sea ice, but last winter most of the archipelago was surrounded by open water. Photograph: Nick Cobbing/Greenpeace Amid the gloomy prospects, there is some cause for hope however. “A large fraction of the US public still doesn’t believe that it is humans that are affecting the climate system,” said Francis. “But one of the silver linings of this pretty dark cloud is that the Arctic is such an obvious and conspicuous change, that anybody can see them happening. There is no ambiguity whatsoever.” But this changing of minds needs to happen quickly, said Hansen: “If we wait for the natural world to reveal itself clearly, it may be too late.”",diasaster:0},

Christmas lights were still sparkling, and groups of tourists ambled down the Kurfürstendamm boulevard, seemingly unaware as to why armed police officers were ushering them along. Berlin truck crash: 12 dead in 'apparent terrorist attack' at Christmas market – live Read more The dark blue truck that had ploughed through the northern edge of the square’s busy Christmas market at around 8pm – killing at least 12 and injuring around 50 – was resting lopsided on the pavement, with only its smashed window pane and a mangled Christmas tree beneath the vehicle’s wheels telling of the force of its deadly ride. In the background, the Kaiser Wilhelm memorial church cast a mournful shadow over the scene. Singed and scarred by the bombs of the second world war, it had been left in ruins to remind future generations of the folly of warfare and fanaticism. Berlin’s Christmas markets are popular because they are little utopias amid the end-of-year bustle, full of slow-roast meats, caramelised almonds and handmade wooden toys. Especially in the week before Christmas, many Berliners will have organised a visit to catch up with friends over cups of mulled wine. Not just since the July attack in Nice, France, have politicians in Germany speculated that Christmas markets were an obvious target for anyone who wanted to expose western Europe’s sense of safety as an illusion. In 2000 police stopped four Algerian Islamists from setting off a bomb at a Christmas market in Strasbourg. Berlin’s mayor, Michael Müller, who visited the scene shortly after 9pm, spoke for many in the city when he admitted concerns that his worst nightmare had turned into a reality: “We hope our fears that this is an attack won’t prove true.” Some of Berlin’s Christmas markets, such as the one on Gendarmenmarkt, have in recent years set up security cordons. Others have banned rucksacks, encouraged stallholders to be more watchful and ordered plain-clothes police officers to mingle with the crowds. But for the market on Breitscheidplatz – encircled by some of the city’s busier multi-lane arteries – that had never been an option. Instead, organisers had tried to make a virtue of the market’s “barrier free” nature, advertising it as the perfect place to drop into after a spot of Christmas shopping. A mini ferris wheel, two carousels and numerous stalls selling sweets were meant to entice children. In the hours after the tragedy, police stated repeatedly that they did not yet know whether it had been a tragic accident or a sinister attack. A group of stallholders on the southern side of the market were convinced they had heard police say the truck’s driver had simply fallen asleep at the wheel. How could anyone want to deliberate crash a truck into such a scene of peace? But as midnight drew near and more details emerged in the aftermath of the crash – with the person thought to be the driver arrested after reportedly fleeing the scene into nearby Tiergarten – it became harder and harder to avoid seeing a motive behind Monday night’s deadly rampage.

Donald Trump seems to be shaping up for an early confrontation with China. President Putin has emerged strengthened, so far, from his Syria gamble (though after the assassination of his ambassador to Turkey, the long-term costs remain to be seen). Once Trump is inaugurated next month, it would be in keeping with his impulsive style to go for a grand bargain with Vladimir Putin. If so, key issues for European security would be on the table. The stakes for Nato in particular will be high. Donald Trump accuses China of 'unpresidented' act over US navy drone Read more Trump has complained that many European allies have cut their spending too far and are in effect free-riding. He’s right on this point. Britain is one of the few European Nato states to meet the target of 2% of GDP spent on defence. But Trump’s cavalier approach to the US commitment to Nato and his evident fascination with Putin risk doing grave damage to the alliance that has been the basis of our security since 1949. The core of Nato is the undertaking that all members give to each other in article 5 of the founding treaty, which states that “an armed attack on one …shall be considered an attack on all”. This deterrent only works if the guarantee is credible: an adversary has to calculate that the US would be willing to use its military might to defend its European allies. For months, Barack Obama has been reinforcing that credibility by sending US armoured brigades to Europe. But Trump has gone further than any previous American president in threatening to walk away from the article 5 commitment if other allies don’t pay more. In his set-piece foreign policy speech last April, he said: “The countries we are defending must pay the cost of their defence and, if not, the US must be prepared to let these countries defend themselves.” It has never been the Nato deal that you only get as much solidarity from the US as you pay for This was reckless. It has never been the Nato deal that you only get as much solidarity from the US as you pay for. And it is precisely the wrong time for any weakening of America’s security commitment to Europe, with Putin’s seizure of Crimea, his fostering of civil war in Ukraine, and increasingly brazen cyber attacks, including in the US election campaign. He’s also been engaging in nuclear blackmail with the deployment of Iskander nuclear-armed missiles to Kaliningrad. We’ve been here before. I was working for Nato in the late 1970s when Moscow stationed SS-20s within striking range of western Europe. Then, the response was Nato’s dual-track decision of 1979 to send US nuclear missiles to Europe and offer a deal to eliminate all such systems – which, years later, Mikhail Gorbachev eventually accepted. The relevant point for today is that clear US leadership in Nato was necessary to deter Moscow. Obama has tried to reassure us that Trump doesn’t really mean to undermine Nato. But it’s vital that the president-elect himself confirms he will stand squarely behind the US commitment to its European allies. And that he avoids a deal with Putin which involves, for instance, pulling back on the forward basing of US forces in eastern Europe, or no further Nato enlargement. Increase Nato payments or face 'consequence', Trump ally tells Europe Read more These disconcerting shifts in the global balance should pushing European governments to spend more on defence, and more wisely. Defence is one of the areas (fighting terrorism and foreign policy are others) where EU countries know Britain makes a huge contribution to European security. Given the many risks, in the Brexit negotiations I believe the other EU states will see they have a strong interest in continuing close cooperation with Britain. We should signal early on in the talks that we see things the same way. After all, a Europe actively tackling the security threats it faces has to be in our interests as well. At the same time, we can be intensely relaxed about the prospect of an EU army – for the simple reason it isn’t going to happen. The idea that the French, for instance, would ever put their armed forces under supranational EU control is laughable. It’s been tried before: in the early 1950s the apostles of European integration, Jean Monnet and Robert Schuman, invented a scheme to pool sovereignty over military power. The result was an elaborate plan for a European defence community, fusing the armed forces of the member states, complete with a parliamentary assembly, a council of ministers and a court. The French parliament vetoed it, and the same would happen today. So Britain’s top priority must be to persuade Donald Trump of the importance of a credible US guarantee to Nato. The security interests of European states are far too important to be traded off in a US deal with Putin.",diasaster:0},

After rebels acceded to the demands, they were stymied by Jabhat Fateh al-Sham, the powerful al-Qaida-linked group, which initially refused to accept the deal.

It’s elegant manoeuvres like this that make me realise of what magnificent acts of solidarity this country is capable. Justin Bieber tells fans to buy NHS Choir song and make it Christmas No 1 Read more But of course we knew that, from the Blitz; what I didn’t previously realise was that Bieber would have the savvy to support our NHS in this way. If I’d known that the soap-faced dreamboat was even aware of the health service, I’d have assumed that he would think it an unmappable swamp: inefficient, unsustainable, a nidus of infection, an enemy to morale, a death trap. In his unexpected allegiance I see something bigger even than Bieber; I’ve fallen prey to a wild underestimation of almost everything, from pop stars to public services. I have come to assume that other people accept negative stories about the health service unquestioningly. Of course I know that people do exist who share my view, but I always assume we’ll recognise each other by secret masonic signs, sceptical eyebrows and odd socks. A multimillionaire with a cute nose and global hair is no more likely, in this battened-down worldview, to support the NHS than he is to join CND. Shortly before Christmas, the Telegraph ran an investigation into agency costs in the NHS, in which it alleged that up to 50% of the hourly charge for each staff member was skimmed off by a private company. To my eyes, the moral of the story was twofold and plain. First, if you want to run a public service at the same time as developing a skilled workforce and ensuring decent conditions in which the people who get paid are the ones who did the work, you need to think for the future, put up the money and train your own staff. Second, the handful of service companies so often at the centre of these brouhahas – Capita, Serco, G4S – are working honourably to the modern business objective of maximising profit, but they do not necessarily care what this does to the NHS, or to the staff who keep it upright. The public sector can outsource anything except its values, but the work, stripped of values, loses its confidence. Most people don’t think the profit motive is the self-regulating wellspring of all valuable human activity As certain as I was of all that, I was equally certain that the story would be used as a stick to beat the NHS with, as proof that the state was incapable of running anything. Even as the institution had its blood let by rent-seekers, all that would remain obvious in the debate was its terminal weakness. What I missed was the fact that people aren’t stupid. You don’t have to be a radical to see who’s winning in this disastrous situation. The true outliers are the ones who think that the profit motive is useful in this environment, and their genius has been to persuade us that this is a normal thing to think. The greater myopia still was that I didn’t recognise how impressive the NHS is, from a distance. Those who oppose public health provision, especially in North America, have their views amplified by a combination of hysterical delivery and private lobby funding. We hear a lot from hard-right Republicans, who think the NHS leaves people with brain tumours to die after a certain age. Or that we have death panels. Or that Stephen Hawking wouldn’t have stood a chance, forced to rely on an NHS that Hawking himself thanks for “a large amount of high-quality treatment”. We hear much less from foreign critics, across the spectrums of politics and wealth, acknowledging how great it would be never to have to stay in a job for the health insurance, never to have to go bankrupt following a life-changing illness, never to have to gamble on the accident-proneness of your own children. The NHS is more than collective insurance against disaster: it changes everything about the confidence we have and the peace we know. The people who can see that best are the ones who don’t live it. Following the transition this year from a government of intermittent nastiness to one of full-pelt social destruction, some things got easier. Satire has become richer: in many ways, it’s been quite a creative time to oppose free market fundamentalism. But what has turned out to be near impossible is keeping in mind how niche are the views that currently constitute what’s hegemonic. Most people don’t want to privatise the NHS. Most people don’t want to legalise foxhunting. Most people never use the phrase “wealth creators”, admiringly, of corporations, as if they’re the only ones keeping the wheels on this truck, while the rest of us are chewing hay on the flatbed. Most people don’t think the profit motive is the self-regulating wellspring of all valuable human activity. Most people have more sense than money, and not just because of the decline of broad-based wage growth. Most people are on the same side; we just need to beliebe (yes, my friend, that is deliberate) in each other.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Calderdale flood victims survey the damage: 'I can’t go through this again'", "content": "Eighteen months ago the Tour de France raced down Mytholmroyd high street. This weekend it was the Calder that rampaged down the road, the river having burst its banks during the wettest Boxing Day recorded in the West Yorkshire town. It showed no mercy, putting in windows, upturning industrial fridges, devastating the community centre, and hitting a former travel agency with such force that most of it collapsed into where the river should have been. At 3pm on Saturday, the Calder was at 5.65m, the highest level recorded and more than 3.5m above its usual peak. In the Dusty Miller Inn, landlord Christian Pollitt and his family watched with horror from their first-floor flat. Up, up and up the river rose, until it was too late to escape. The Guardian view on the UK floods: they will be back | Editorial Read more The floodwater rushed into the pub until it was well over 6ft deep, almost as high as the fire exit signs. In a matter of minutes, a £50,000 kitchen was a floating junkyard, £20,000 of festive food contaminated with sewage-laden flood water. Pollitt, trapped upstairs with three children, eight other adults and a dog, rang for help. An hour and a half later, they were rescued. “We were stranded. We had to climb out on to the roof and were picked up by lifeboat,” said Pollitt, still in a daze on Sunday as he surveyed the wreckage of the Dusty Miller and his other pub, a micro brewery called the Libertine, which opened only two weeks ago and now resembles a windowless, muddy squat. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Bags of damaged stock outside shops in Hebden Bridge. Photograph: Barbara Cook/Demotix/Corbis At least 2,000 homes in the Calder Valley were badly affected by the Boxing Day floods, according to Calderdale council, and 200 businesses were also hit, one of which was Buttylicious in Todmorden. Mopping the floor on Sunday, Pat Brierley said she’d had enough. Three times her sandwich shop has flooded since she got the keys in July 2012. “I can’t go through this again,” she said. “I can’t face it. The lease is up at the end of January, so I’m off then. I doubt I’ll get the bond back.” Almost everyone in the valley agreed that this was the worst flood in living memory. In 2012, 1,200 properties were affected, the council said. Around the corner from Buttylicious, Paul Gibbons was grimly hosing away sewage from his factory near the Rochdale canal on Sunday morning. His firm, NR Components, makes caravan awnings. The factory floor was still a few inches under water, with at least 30 sewing machines worth £6,000 each ruined. “They’re goosed – totally goosed,” he said. Gibbons, 67, has been unable to get insurance since the last floods, in 2012, which resulted in a claim for more than £500,000. “To be fair, I wouldn’t insure me either,” he said. His son, Sam, suggested the many millions spent on improving Todmorden’s flood defences would be better used as a reconstruction fund. “They clearly don’t work, so they might as well just dish out the cash to us all every time,” he said. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Water is pumped out of a letter box in Todmorden. Photograph: Barbara Cook/Demotix/Corbis Up the road, volunteers at the Hippodrome theatre were clearing up after their fourth major flood since 2000. Late in the morning on Sunday, the dressing rooms were still 4ft underwater, though they had managed to save most props, costumes and lighting rigs by piling them up on the stage in a dawn operation on Boxing Day. The theatre is insured, though chairman David Winslow wondered for how much longer. “In 2000 our claim was £200,000. In 2012 and 2013 it was about £70,000. Now this,” he said. In Todmorden on Sunday night, a family from Bradford brought chicken biryani to feed 250 people. Zain Shah, 26, and his sister, brothers and parents, had clubbed together to buy £350 of biryani to share with those who were unable to cook – as well as 200 doughnuts from Asda. Shah, who has a business in Brighouse in the Calder Valley, said he had seen the pictures on the news and wanted to help. I.E.T Community team (@Todsprout) People are so kind, curry dinners at townhall early evening thanks Zain J Shah. https://t.co/TlNni1960F December 27, 2015 All over the valley, those lucky enough to live on high ground were out in force, Marigolds on, mops and brushes in hand, eager to help with the relief effort. In Hebden Bridge, a crisis centre set up in the town hall received far more offers of help than cries for help, according to volunteer Sonia Robertson. “It’s been amazing – everyone wants to pitch in,” she said. A Calderdale flood relief fund has been set up, with donations reaching £60,000 by Sunday evening. Like much of downtown Hebden, the Trades Club by the canal had no electricity, but was determined to stay open anyway. An impromptu soup kitchen had been set up, with volunteers ladling out bowls of hot homemade soup and veggie curry to anyone who wanted it in a room lit by portable camping lamps. Nearby, St James’s church was offering free candles to anyone without power. Few people in Calderdale seemed angry. Many had their own ideas for preventing future flooding, whether that be tree planting on the hillside, regular river dredging, or a ban on building on the flood plain. But most seemed resigned to what appears to be the reality of living at the bottom of a steep valley. “Even if we had spent the £32m we’ve asked the government for to build the next phase of flood defences, this still would have happened,” said Rob Holden, a Conservative councillor from Sowerby Bridge. “It’s just the geography of the land.” In the Calder Valley, any ire was reserved for the insurers: either because they refused to cover those who have suffered before, or because they weren’t answering their phones all weekend. But in east Lancashire, some residents felt they had been forgotten. In Billington, Harry Stephenson staged a one-man demonstration to draw attention to the villagers’ suffering, after the river Calder burst its banks and swept across fields that lie in the shadow of Whalley Arches, near Clitheroe. On Sunday lunchtime, the 27-year-old wind turbine engineer grabbed a megaphone and left his flooded home to walk the half-mile into neighbouring Whalley, a pretty tourist village. Once there, to loud applause, he interrupted a live television broadcast to complain that he and his neighbours had been overlooked in the Boxing Day rescue operation. “We’re the forgotten village,” he said afterwards. “In Whalley they’ve had all the army, the police and all the PR, but here there’s been nothing – until now. All we had was a single policeman banging on doors, saying we should get out. Suddenly, when the water’s subsided, they’ve realised we’re here.

I’ve promised whatever help I can give – including an assurance that they get the same package of help that’s going to Cumbria. Some of these people haven’t got insurance, or else they haven’t been able to contact their insurers over the Christmas period. They have to be given financial help as soon as is humanly possible.” He added: “I’m taking pictures to send to David Cameron, so he can see how bad it is here.”",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Lynton Crosby knighthood discredits honours system, say Labour MPs", "content": "David Cameron has been accused of undermining the honours system after it emerged that Lynton Crosby, the political strategist who ran the Conservatives’ election campaign, is set to get a knighthood in the New Year honours list. Tory MPs welcomed the decision, which marks a significant escalation of the policy Cameron has adopted of allowing honours to be awarded for political service. The Labour MP Mary Creagh criticised the appointment on Twitter, while Paul Flynn, another Labour MP, said he was pleased about the news because it would discredit the honours system, which he has long opposed. Flynn, a member of the public administration and constitutional affairs committee, said: “I welcome this appointment because it will drive the honours system into deeper disrepute. The more it is abused, the more people will come to regard it as at best arbitrary, and at worst corrupt.” The Labour MP John Mann said giving a knighthood to Crosby was “degrading” to the honours system and “an insult to the country’s heroes”. Ukip’s Jonathan Arnott also condemned the decision. But the Conservative MP Glyn Davies said Crosby had made a “massive contribution to UK politics” that deserved recognition. Fellow Tory Bernard Jenkin, the chair of the public administration and constitutional affairs committee, said knighthoods such as this were “not simply in the gift of the prime minister” because they have to be approved by the committee overseeing parliamentary and political honours. “Should people in politics not get an honour just because they give public service through politics?” he asked. “I think that question answers itself.” The Guardian view on David Cameron’s new peers: government of the club, by the club, for the club | Editorial Read more Jenkin also claimed that some of the worst abuses of the honours system took place under Labour, citing the so-called lavender list drawn up by Harold Wilson when he resigned as prime minister in 1976. Jenkin said the system is now much cleaner because there is proper oversight of honours. Crosby’s knighthood has not yet been officially announced, but sources familiar with the honours list effectively confirmed that Crosby would be recognised when the full names are revealed on Thursday, following reports in the Sunday Times. Honours for political service were supposed to be banned after Tony Blair took office in 1997, although in practice some MPs continued to receive knighthoods on the grounds that they are being rewarded for their contribution to parliament. Cameron has been a lavish dispenser of patronage – he even included his barber, Raffaele Claudio Carbosiero, in an honours list two years ago “for services to hairdressing” – and he has revived the idea of granting honours to people explicitly for political service. One Conservative source said it might be hard for Labour to complain about the Crosby honour because Spencer Livermore, who ran Ed Miliband’s election campaign, received a peerage in the dissolution honours list, even though he lost the election in May and Crosby won. Peerages are a means of creating working peers. The link between peerages and honours is supposed to have been broken, although that distinction is lost on the many people who continue to donate to political parties in the hope of elevation to the upper house. Crosby’s knighthood is likely to prove controversial not only because he is a foreign political consultant receiving a high-profile honour, but because his uncompromising tactics have previously appalled some of his opponents. Having made his name in Australia, where he worked for the right-of-centre Liberal party and masterminded election victories for John Howard, Crosby first played a major role in the UK when he ran the Conservative party’s election campaign in 2005, under Michael Howard’s leadership. Crosby approved hard-hitting campaign slogans, including one saying “it’s not racist to impose limits on immigration”, which at the time led to the accusation that he was engaged in “dog whistle” politics by making a covert appeal to racist views. Lynton Crosby: the man who really won the election for the Tories Read more The Tories lost in 2005, but Crosby, who was brought in relatively late, was not blamed and, after running Boris Johnson’s two successful London mayoral campaigns, he was hired by Cameron and George Osborne to take overall command of the 2015 general election campaign. Most of those involved in the campaign speak very highly of his contribution, in particular his ability to impose message discipline on the party, and his decision to focus heavily on winning Liberal Democrat seats in the south-west of England, some of which were considered impregnable, but eventually fell to the Tories.",diasaster:0},

Swishing his aluminium pan back and forth through a waist-deep pool of brackish water, he wearily scrutinises its contents for glimmers of gold. With the sun beginning to beat down, the young miner splashes handfuls of the liquid – laced with mercury and cyanide to separate gold from unwanted rock – on his face to stay alert. Nigerian gold mining: farmers choose death by lead poisoning over poverty | Monica Mark Read more Around him is a scene like something out of Mad Max. Overseers set truck tyres alight to soften ground that’s been baked solid by the fierce Sahara sun. As the flames relent, newly arrived workers step in to blast away chunks of the weakened turf with homemade explosives. A series of muffled bangs ring out across the desert encampment. “Watch out!” the miners shout at one another. Amid the chaotic pall of chemical fumes, Isaac sticks to his duties as a gold “cleaner”. Since fleeing his home city of Nyala in western Sudan’s war-torn Darfur region, he has scrimped tirelessly to try to repay the cost of his tools and turn a profit. Now, this sparsely populated hinterland to the south of the Egyptian border is beginning to show promise. He says the terrible conditions will not dash his dreams of striking it rich. “There’s no work elsewhere, so what choice do I have anyway?” he says. “It’s this or nothing.” Facebook Twitter Pinterest Salahuddein Salah, site manager of the El-Etimad mine, displays gold derived through the mercury and cyanide process. Photograph: Leyland Cecco for the Guardian Prospectors The government in Khartoum faces a similar dilemma. After growing at roughly 8% a year during the 2000s, Sudan’s economy now lies in tatters after South Sudan’s secession in 2011 deprived it of 75% of the income from oil reserves. There are conflicts in seven of its 18 states. With El Niño this winter sure to bring further drought, authorities have realised the urgency of reviving the economy and are trying to boost an industry that had been in the shadows for decades. About 200 local firms have taken advantage of new legislation that has opened up swaths of the country to prospectors, establishing operations across eight states, according to Sudan’s ministry of minerals. Looking to woo international investors and mining giants, the government has recently issued press releases touting Sudan’s ambition to become the third largest gold producer on the continent, behind South Africa and Ghana. Can consumer power make space for small miners in the jewellery supply chain? Read more The country produced four tonnes of gold in 2009, 36 in 2014, and was expected to reach 74 tonnes this year, according to official figures. By comparison, Ghana produced 107.9 tonnes in 2013, a figure thought to be higher now. So far, however, only a few foreign businesses have risked setting up mining enterprises in Sudan. US sanctions, imposed during the 1990s when Khartoum harboured Osama bin Laden, have made it difficult for interested firms to secure the sums necessary to launch large-scale mine constructions. “Lots of European banks are under pressure to have nothing to do with Sudan,” says Hugh Stuart, CEO of Orca Gold, a Canadian company that is one of the few to have taken the plunge. “It does take us a while to work out how best to transfer money there.” Orca is currently looking to the Arabian Gulf for the $200-$300m required to bore a proper mine on its land to the north of Abu Hamed. Analysts also suggest some foreign firms might be wary of extensive dealings with the Sudanese government, which insists that all gold be sold through its central bank, and whose president, Omar al-Bashir, is wanted for war crimes by the international criminal court. The biggest obstacle to foreign investment, though, appears to be foreign firms’ desire to distance themselves from local mining companies and their chaotic practices. Danger So lax is the enforcement of environmental regulations that many small companies dump their mining waste – including mercury and cyanide – along the Nile. Come the August flood, the waters rise and wash riverside debris towards the Mediterranean. “We fear it will seep into the water table. We fear for the river,” says Salah Abdel Rahman, a conservationist and Nubian rights activist in Abri, in the midst of the gold fields. Abdel Rahman and his peers also say that the possibility of quick riches is luring young local men from the fields, thereby draining local agricultural labour and changing the character of the villages. In the absence of any real health and safety laws, and with no medical assistance for miles around, many of these workers are saddled with a range of ailments. Local activists say cancer rates have skyrocketed as a result of mercury smoke and accidental cyanide ingestion. “We are all careful,” Isaac said, immersing himself once more in a chemical-ridden gold pool for the remainder of his 12-14-hour shift. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Miners watch as rock is ground into a powder to be later combined with mercury to separate out the gold. Photograph: Leyland Cecco For the time being, the government’s hopes of economic revival rest upon small Sudanese mining companies, although most suffer from a lack of expertise. “Nothing is being done systematically, and so a lot of ore is being wasted,” says mining geologist Ayman Ibrahim, who works in the vast arid expanse to the north of Dongola. Local infrastructure is still lacking, and most artisanal miners, like Isaac, are so beholden to traditional techniques that it can be hard to integrate them into a more mechanised setup. But to many of the eager young professionals who’ve flocked to the north straight out of mining college, those in charge seem woefully ill-equipped to maximise the industry’s potential. Only now, Ibrahim says, are most universities teaching the correct geology that will enable greater numbers to pick up on the reddish rock patterns that signal the proximity of gold. Facebook Twitter Pinterest A miner pans for gold in a pool containing mercury, which poses a serious health risk. Photograph: Leyland Cecco Ibrahim says samples of rock have to be dispatched 560 miles south to Khartoum for testing because their Chinese suppliers haven’t yet made good on a promise to deliver analytical instruments to the site. “That slows everything down,” he says. “There really are very many problems.” Boom But despite these teething troubles, there is still some evidence to suggest that domestic firms might yet have it in them to spearhead a boom. Salahadin Salah, site manager at the El-Etimad mine in Dongola, points to his company’s recently installed heavy duty crushing equipment – shipped in from Guangzhou and capable of reducing 300 tonnes of excavated rock to rubble a day – as evidence of their ambition.

The relative safety of the region is also a draw, given the mounting instability in other parts of the country. Thousands of Darfuris like Isaac have fled to the Nile valley, bringing with them skills and knowhow honed in the mines of the Jebel Marra. From the troubled South Kordofan and Blue Nile states has come a ready supply of prospecting scouts. “The country’s just been overlooked,” says Neil Passmore, CEO of Hannam and Partners, a corporate finance advisory firm with interests in Sudan. “It’s on the US sanctions list, so a lot of investors can’t travel there, but the main evidence for me is the scale of the artisanal mining that’s going on. “No exaggeration – it’s like nowhere else in the world.” This article was made possible by support from the Pulitzer Center for Crisis Reporting, and first appeared on Quartz Africa",diasaster:0},

Opponents say the bill unfairly targets leftwing organisations critical of government policy, leaving rightwing pro-settlement groups immune from the same scrutiny, as those tend to rely on private donors – who are exempt from the measures. ‘We don’t need governments to make peace’: Israel gets unofficial Iranian 'embassy' Read more The so-called transparency bill, sponsored by the justice minister, Ayelet Shaked, requires organisations to provide details of the countries funding their activities in any communication with elected officials, imposing a 29,000 shekel (£5,000) fine on any who fail to do so. Employees would also be required to wear special tags when working in Israel’s parliament. The measures passed the first major legislative hurdle on Sunday when government ministers agreed to it in principal, making it almost certain to pass into law. The legislation is expected to receive support from all the coalition factions within the Israeli government when it is put to a final vote. It was part of a coalition agreement made by Shaked’s Hayabit Hayehudi party and Binyamin Netanyahu. Opposition leaders have put pressure on the Israeli prime minister and coalition members to try to prevent the vote. The EU ambassador to Israel recently met Shaked to warn that the bill would undermine Israeli’s image as “a democratic and pluralistic country”, Israeli media reported. EU officials were quoted as saying that “Israel should be very careful about reigning in its prosperous democratic society with laws that are reminiscent of totalitarian regimes”. Ayman Odeh, the leader of the united front of Israel’s Arab parties in the Knesset, accused the government of trying to silence criticism. “The government led by Binyamin Netanyahu is chipping away at what is left of the democratic space in Israel,” he said. “Human rights organisations fill an essential role in any society which aspires to be democratic, which is why they are constantly targeted as enemies of Israeli sovereignty.” . Zehava Galon, head of the opposition Meretz party, described the bill as incredibly dangerous. “Beyond the fact that this is a bill that ostensibly seeks to increase transparency, it seeks to label human beings,” she said. The organisation Breaking the Silence, comprised of former soldiers who oppose Israel’s actions in the occupied territories, said the timing of the bill was intended to distract attention from the charging of suspects arrested in connection with the arson attack on a Palestinian family in the West Bank village of Duma.

{ "title":"The Guardian view on trade unions: needed as much as ever", "content": "There is little to be said for the strike stopping some customers getting their Christmas presents in the post, nor the ones threatened by British Airways cabin staff and baggage handlers at many of the UK’s airports that threaten long-planned festive breaks, nor for the long-running dispute that is making the lives of commuters in parts of south-east England so miserable. But they are not the start of a wild-eyed workers’ insurgency, as some overexcited reports have suggested in the past few days. Nor, whether or not they achieve their legitimate aim of protecting their members’ interests, are they helping the wider trade union movement to find a new relevance and authority as membership declines in a rapidly changing economy. There will possibly be a third more days lost to strikes in 2016 than in 2015. But last year was exceptionally peaceful on the industrial front, the most peaceful since 2005. The total of lost days for 2016 is still historically low. The point of this unnecessary row is that in some quarters, although it would seem not in Downing Street, there is still an appetite for more union-bashing laws. Some backbenchers hanker after the ultimate objective of the anti-union right since the Trade Disputes Act of 1906 reversed the Taff Vale judgment, removing trade union immunity from damages – thus effectively making industrial action impossible. This is daft on every front, not least because there would be no majority for it in parliament; the government was forced to make serial concessions on the trade union act, which is due to come into force next March. It already significantly narrows the possibilities of a strike by requiring not only a majority in favour of strike action, but a turnout of at least 50% of those entitled to vote. If parliament approves more regulations next month, it will also ban strike action in “important public services”, including the railways, unless it is backed by more than 40% of those entitled to vote. What workers need is not more legislation to curb trade unions, but a trade union movement that is modern and responsive to the needs of the world where most people work. Trade union members tend to be older, better off and work in the old public sector. In the private sector, union membership is below 15%. If unions can’t find a way to reach younger workers to whom the tradition of collective action is unfamiliar, they are doomed to a slow death. Half of all jobs growth is among the self-employed. This is an audience that is deterred rather than attracted by old white men sounding antagonistic towards their employers. Last year the union Community, which has set out to recruit self-employed people as well as a wide range of other workers, conducted research that found, if offered help by a trade union, a mere 19% would sign up. Offered similar help from an independent source, 75% would take up the offer. The union’s latest project is with Indycube, an organisation that sets up co-work spaces in redundant offices. Community wants to offer the self-employed not traditional union services but advice on contracts or slow payers. Others look across the Atlantic to movements like the minimum wage campaign Fight for $15, which began with a trade unionist, David Rolf, and has become a nationwide social movement organising for decent pay in sectors like fast food and social care.

{ "title":"Saudis dropped British-made cluster bombs in Yemen, Fallon tells Commons", "content": "The defence secretary was forced to tell the Commons that British-made cluster bombs had been dropped by Saudi Arabia in Yemen, prompting MPs and charities to say that the UK should stop supporting the Gulf state’s military action. Sir Michael Fallon said that a “limited number” of the controversial BL755 bombs had been used by Saudi Arabia, shortly after the Gulf state formally admitted it had deployed the weapons in the Yemeni conflict. Although an international treaty bans the use of cluster bombs, Fallon defended Britain’s support for Saudi Arabia and insisted there was no breach of international law because they were used against “legitimate military targets”. The UK is one of 120 countries to have signed the 2008 Ottawa convention on cluster munitions, banning their use or assistance with their use. Saudi Arabia is not a signatory to the treaty. The munitions pose an indiscriminate risk to civilians because they contain dozens of bomblets that can explode long after they are dropped. Fallon made the statement to the House of Commons after the Guardian revealed he had known for around a month about a government analysis pointing to Saudi having used the UK-made bombs. Shortly before he spoke, Saudi Arabia made a statement overturning previous denials that it had used the weapons and declaring it would not deploy them again. The Scottish National party, which has led calls for the UK to come clean about the use of cluster bombs, said it was a “shameful stain on the UK’s foreign policy and its relationship with Saudi Arabia, as well as a failure by this government to uphold its legal treaty obligations”. Brendan O’Hara, the SNP defence spokesman, said there were more questions to answer and pressed the defence secretary for an independent inquiry into violations of international law in Yemen. “Theresa May must live up to her pledge to investigate any violations like this,” he said. Earlier, Angus Robertson, the SNP Westminster leader, called on the prime minister to reveal what she knew about the use of the UK-made cluster bombs but she declined to answer. Several Conservative MPs also brought pressure to bear on the government, although others backed Fallon’s defence of the military relationship. Tania Mathias, MP for Twickenham, called on Fallon to commit the UK to help clear bomblets caused by cluster munitions from villages in Yemen. cluster bomb graphic Julian Lewis, chair of the Commons defence committee, asked Fallon “whether the Saudis have explained why they used these British-supplied weapons, presumably in the knowledge it would cause considerable embarrassment to the British government”. Although there are no UK forces engaged in combat in Yemen, Britain is helping to train Saudi-led forces with targeting and continues to sell arms to the Gulf state despite international concerns about the coalition’s compliance with humanitarian law. Britain had previously accepted Saudi claims that there was no use of UK cluster munitions, although the government promised to seek fresh assurances last May when Amnesty International published evidence from the ground. Since then, ITV News and Sky have released further reports showing UK-made cluster bombs in Yemen. The prime minister of Yemen’s rebel Houthi government has also accused the UK of “war crimes” for supplying arms to the Saudi-led coalition, which is conducting military operations to restore the previous regime overthrown in 2015. Fallon mounted a defence of the UK’s backing for Saudi Arabia and claimed the Gulf nation was now considering signing up to the convention on cluster munitions. “The Saudis believe that in this particular instance they did respect international humanitarian law,” he said. Fallon repeated Saudi Arabia’s claims that the bombs were used in a border area and against “legitimate targets” but was unable to say what would happen to the remaining stocks, how many cluster bombs had been used or how many were left. The shadow international development secretary, Kate Osamor, said she hoped the Saudi Arabia admission would be “used as part of a war crimes case”, while Wayne David, the shadow defence minister, said the weapons had a “toxic legacy – lying on battlefields and threatening civilians, especially children, long after a conflict has ended”. David asked the government to commit to carrying out an examination into whether current policies needed to be changed and said an independent United Nations-led investigation on possible breaches of humanitarian and international law in Yemen was needed. Labour MP Stephen Doughty questioned why the UK should in future trust anything Saudi Arabia had been saying; it previously denied that UK-made cluster bombs and suggested pictures were the product of manipulation. Tom Brake, the Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesman, said it was a “shocking admission that takes the UK’s complicity in the bombing of innocent civilians in Yemen to a whole new level”. He added: “It’s about time the government ended its involvement in this murderous campaign. Ministers must immediately halt sales of arms to Saudi Arabia and any other regimes that breach international humanitarian law.” Charities and international bodies said the admission increased the case for the UK to withdraw support for Saudi Arabia’s role in the war by selling arms and providing military training. The disclosure by Fallon is likely to increase calls for MPs to preserve the parliamentary watchdog that scrutinises arms exports controls, which is made up of members of four other committees and is under threat of being disbanded. Ann Clwyd, a Labour member of the watchdog, revealed the foreign affairs committee has withdrawn its membership from the body over a row about a leak relating a report on Saudi Arabia and Yemen. The MP for Cynon Valley said: “I’m a member of the foreign affairs select committee. That committee, as I understand it, and the chairman is over there, has withdrawn from the arms export committee. “There was considerable pressure, with visits from Saudi Arabian ministers, when we were deciding our report on the Yemen. I think it’s right the House should know that. There are pressures going on here. In the past, the arms export committee was quite strong, it revoked 50 licences in the last parliament. It’s regrouping was delayed by six months in this parliament, and that I think speaks for itself.” Kate Allen, the director of Amnesty International UK, said Fallon’s statement was not good enough. “We need to see a total suspension of all weapons sales to Saudi Arabia that risk fuelling further atrocities in Yemen,” she said. “This is a very simple issue. If the Saudi-led coalition can use British-made cluster munitions against Yemeni villages, then we shouldn’t be surprised that it can also bomb homes, hospitals, schools and factories in Yemen. “It’s long overdue for the UK to start honouring its international obligation to halt weapons sales where there’s a clear risk that those weapons could be used to carry out serious breaches of international humanitarian law.” Mark Goldring, the chief executive of Oxfam GB, said the promise not to use UK-made cluster bombs was a small step but there was a long way to go. “The government’s international credibility is being mangled under the weight of evidence of international humanitarian law violations in Yemen,” he said. “It cannot possibly expect to be taken seriously while it continues to ignore the breaches of the rules of war and sell arms that fuel this brutal conflict. “The mounting civilian casualties in Yemen, the millions forced to flee their homes, the collapse of health care and the economy, all point to the same simple conclusion; it is imperative to end arms sales and military support to Saudi Arabia now and bring the warring parties to the negotiating table.” The UK’s relationship with Saudi Arabia has come under the spotlight in recent weeks after Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, made critical remarks suggesting the state was engaged in proxy wars against Iran in the Middle East. His position was immediately disowned by No 10, which regards Saudi Arabia as an essential ally. Fallon was chosen to given the statement despite the fact that arms exports are the policy responsibility of Johnson in the Foreign Office. The UK and US are supporting the Saudis against the Houthi militia, which is aligned with Iran. The Saudi-led air campaign has devastated huge swaths of rebel-controlled areas, with high civilian casualties. Last week, the US suspended arms sales planned for Saudi Arabia but the UK has refused to follow suit. The UK government has been prevaricating for months on the issue of arms sales to Saudi Arabia, its biggest market for weapons sales. It also has a military team in place at Saudi headquarters giving advice on the air campaign but the Ministry of Defence insisted they did not help with targeting but simply advised on whether targets were not in breach of international law. The cluster bombs, the use of which was first raised by Amnesty International, had been dropped between December 2015 and January 2016 near al-Khadra in Yemen. While the UK had stopped manufacturing cluster bombs in 1989 and signed up to a convention in 2008 not to use them, neither Saudi Arabia nor the US has signed the convention. Since the UK is an ally of both, and the convention says signatories should not aid or abet countries using them, the legal position is unclear. Andrew Smith, a spokesman for the Campaign Against Arms Trade, said: “The use of UK cluster bombs by Saudi Arabia is characteristic of a brutal war and a brutal regime. If Saudi forces are prepared to use cluster bombs, then why is the UK continuing to arm and support the regime? “Once a weapon has left these shores, there’s little if any control over where and when it will be used and who it will be used against. The UK must act now to stop the arms sales and to end its complicity in the humanitarian catastrophe that has been unleashed on the Yemeni people.”",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Where is Bana? Girl who tweeted from Aleppo is safely evacuated", "content": "A seven-year-old girl whose Twitter account offered a glimpse into the violence and loss in besieged east Aleppo has been evacuated from the city following worldwide concern about her safety. Fears for Bana al-Abed’s safety spiked when her account, run by her mother, Fatemah, was temporarily shut down earlier this month and it was unclear if the family were caught in warfare or captured by forces loyal the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad. The last message from east Aleppo, signed on Sunday night by her mother, was a plea to bring the family to safety: “Please please please make this ceasefire work & get us out now. We are so tired.” Hours later, as a stalled evacuation resumed, a Turkish NGO said Bana had made it safely out. “This morning @AlabedBana was also rescued from Aleppo with her family. We warmly welcomed them,” the Humanitarian Relief Foundation (IHH) wrote on its Twitter account on Monday, sharing an IHH aid worker’s selfie picture with the girl.

We are happy because our voice reached all the world. We are free. “I am sad because I leave my country. I left my soul there. I want to take our freedom there, not be like a refugee in other countries.” Bana has amassed hundreds of thousands of followers and has become a symbol of the tragedy unfolding in Syria. Her account has chronicled the realities of life in a once-teeming metropolis, by posting pictures of the ongoing destruction, including those of her own rubble-littered street. Hours before the account was shut down, Bana and Fatemeh tweeted a farewell message saying forces loyal to Assad were bearing down on their neighbourhood. “We are sure the army is capturing us now. We will see each other another day dear world,” read Sunday night’s tweet. The mother and daughter, who were interviewed last month by the Guardian in a video call over Skype while planes flew overhead and machine gunfire raged, had apparently received death threats in the days preceding the account’s closure. “When those bombs strike, our hearts shake before the buildings do,” Fatemah told the Guardian at the time. JK Rowling is among those following Bana and Fatemah on Twitter and she sent ebooks of her Harry Potter novels to the girl after she said she liked to read “to forget the war”. Following the closure of the account, the British author retweeted several messages asking after her, using the hashtag “Whereisbana?” At least 15,000 children are among the more than 300,000 people who have been killed in Syria’s five-year war. Thousands of others have been displaced in the ongoing fighting between rebels and forces loyal to the Syrian government. Residents of east Aleppo have spoken of relentless bombings and shelling, cuts in basic services such as water and electricity, and dwindling supplies of food and medicines. Evacuations restarted on Monday after delays over the weekend. A source with knowledge of the evacuation deal told the Guardian that roughly 1,000 civilians in 25 buses had been evacuated overnight into the western Aleppo countryside, and another 20 are still stuck at the government crossing in the district of Ramouseh. “I want for my kids a good future, but this is the matter here, Fatemah said on Monday. “When we got out, we had a lot of suffering, because we stayed almost 24 hours in a bus without water and food or anything. We stayed like a prisoner, a hostage. Finally, we arrived here and we thank God and we thank all our friends who have supported us.” Bana’s last tweet with her mother before the evacuation appealed to the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, and foreign minister, Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu, to put the ceasefire back on track. “Dear @MevlutCavusoglu & @RT—Erdogan please please please make this ceasefire work & get us out now. We are so tired,” it said. Responding in a tweet Monday, Çavuşoğlu wrote: “Difficulties on the ground won’t deter us sister. Rest assured that we are doing all to get you and thousands of others to safety.” The Islamic charity IHH is playing a large role in the transport of aid for Aleppo as well as the transfer of evacuated Syrians into camps in Idlib province near the Turkish border. An IHH spokesman told AFP that Bana was “likely to be transferred to the camps in Idlib province”.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Iraqi forces 'seize key base in Ramadi from Isis'", "content": "Iraqi troops have regained control of a government complex in Ramadi, officials claimed, drawing closer to ousting Islamic State militants from the Sunni heartland city conquered last summer. Progress in the gruelling ground offensive launched last week has been slow, with the militants entrenched in a city that remains home to thousands of civilians trapped in the midst of the battle. Taking control of the central state buildings on Sunday, a site conquered by Isis earlier this year, brings Iraqi troops closer to reversing an embarrassing defeat that saw the capital of Anbar province fall to a few hundred fighters from the terror group in May. “By controlling the complex this means that they have been defeated in Ramadi,” Sabah al-Numani, a spokesman for the government forces, told Reuters. “The next step is to clear pockets that could exist here or there in the city.” Isis takes Iraqi city of Ramadi Read more However, a US defence official said on Sunday that it was not clear whether the complex had been regained. “We are unable to confirm at this time whether or not they have cleared the government center,” a US military official told Reuters, on condition of anonymity. The assault has been led by members of Iraq’s elite counter-terrorism unit, who have taken the lead in battling the militants and circumventing the booby traps laid down by Isis fighters throughout the city. “I think the liberation of the government complex will be the falling domino that leads to the fall of the rest of the districts,” said Hisham al-Hashimi, an Iraqi expert who advises the government on Isis. The expected loss of Ramadi would be the latest in a series of defeats for Isis in recent months in both Iraq and Syria, which has prompted the group’s leader and self-proclaimed caliph, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, to issue a rare audio recording meant to reassure his followers. Location of Ramadi in Iraq In November Isis lost the city of Sinjar, the ancestral homeland of the Yazidi minority, to an offensive led by the Kurdish peshmerga and backed by US warplanes. Kurdish forces are also working to sever the militants’ supply lines between Syria and Iraq. Meanwhile, across the border, Kurdish paramilitaries have conquered large swaths of northern Syria from the terror group, drawing closer to their de facto capital of Raqqa. The militants have not been completely ousted from Ramadi, however, and they still hold Mosul, the capital of Nineveh province in the north, a battle that has been repeatedly delayed. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Iraqi forces in Ramadi’s from Daesh terrorist continue in al-Hoz district Photograph: Anadolu Agency/Getty General Ismail al-Mahlawi, head of the Anbar military operations, told AP that the advance had been hampered by suicide bombers, snipers and booby traps. Ramadi carries crucial symbolic value. Anbar was once the scene of the “Sunni Awakening” campaign during the US occupation, which recruited local Sunnis to fight against al-Qaida in Iraq, the precursor of Isis. The fall of the province’s capital to the militants was a sign of how far Iraq’s unravelling as a nation state had come since the overthrow in 2003 of Saddam Hussein’s regime. The fighting in Anbar has displaced millions of Iraqis, with many others still trapped within the city, risking their use as human shields by Isis fighters who have repeatedly called on them to remain within the caliphate’s borders.",diasaster:0},

It’s held just a few hundred miles from the South Pole, and it’s a gruelling race, as the official website describes, “this ultramarathon challenge is reserved for only the toughest of endurance athletes. The 100km (62.1 miles) distance will seem endless, run under a sun that never sets against the backdrop of hills, mountains and large expanses of ice.” Marathons are tough enough, but the Antarctic Ultra is run all on snow and ice, in temperatures typically around –15C (5F) although it can drop to –40C (–40F) and that doesn’t take into account the windchill factor as biting katabatic winds race down from nearby glaciers, making it feel even colder. The average course elevation is 700m (2,300ft) and the setting is magnificent at the foot of the Ellsworth Mountains, the highest mountain chain in Antarctica, although competitors may not be so interested in the scenery. And on the plus side, it’s also usually dry at this time of year and there’s 24 hours daylight in the Antarctic summer. Some may even relish the quiet because there are very few spectators, and not even any penguins – they don’t live this far south. In fact the only sound apart from the other runners is usually the wind blowing at an average speed of 46kph (28mph). The race takes place every January and the next event is on January 20.

{ "title":"The Guardian view on the UK floods: they will be back", "content": "The floods return, bringing with them the increasingly familiar pictures of distress: the debris of scoured-out houses, and the empty phrases of a hollow politician. “Unprecedented”; “whatever is needed”: Mr Cameron seems to have forgotten that he promised us “whatever it takes” two years ago. Clearly, it took rather more than he was then prepared to give. This time, the army has been sent in to reinforce his rhetoric. At least the floodwater is an enemy that will certainly have retreated in a week or two, although it will leave devastation and suffering behind. The victims of this catastrophe deserve better than the government is giving them. They are not just having their lives disrupted and their homes turned into dank and stinking shells. They will lose financially; they have lost security. In some cases they are being flooded for the third or fourth time in 10 years. The repetition should not deaden us to their suffering. Nor should the knowledge that these scenes will almost certainly be repeated, next winter or the winter after that. Climate change and inadequate preparation – a government that does far less than what it would take – ensure that the floods will become a painfully regular future of British life. Whatever the details of particular government mistakes, there is a larger pattern emerging here. What we see on the news today is the “green crap” backing up all over the political landscape. The phrase is tightly associated with the Australian political strategist Lynton Crosby, even if the exact origin is lost in the mists of a lunch with the two political journalists who reported in 2013 that the government was dropping “all that green crap” on David Cameron’s orders. It has emerged that Crosby is to be rewarded with a knighthood for his services in winning Mr Cameron the election. The news is quite as repulsive as anything else that the floods have washed down but distaste is not the important thing about it. Mr Cameron can hang a bauble on Mr Crosby’s name for proposing narrow, focused, short-term policies that helped him to win a second term in office, even if we should not underestimate the contribution that the opposition parties made to his victory. But the problems the government and the country now face are still as they were in 2013, broad, unfocussed and long-term. The peculiar destructiveness of modern floods arises from complex causes acting over long periods. They are not just a product of unprecedented rainfall, but of well-established patterns of land use and river management. All too often these have been greedy, arrogant, and short-termist: changing them will require co-ordinated efforts, maintained over decades. The way in which the floods have recurred over the past decade does not make for optimism. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Clearing up the debris in Glenridding in England’s Lake district, after flooding caused by Storm Desmond, December 2015. Photograph: Ashley Cooper / Barcroft Media None the less, some things are new this time around. The floods now have moved out of rural areas and into the heart of cities with political weight. It may be wrong that our sympathies are partial and unevenly distributed, but Leeds and Manchester impinge on London and Westminster in a way that Somerset and Cumbria just can’t. The pressure on the government will increase with each urban disaster. This is a tragedy, but it is also a necessary condition for the strenuous and expensive action that will be required to minimise the consequences of future rains. Climate change is no longer something that can be dismissed as a concern only of the readership for broadsheet newspapers. The link with flooding is now taken for granted: in fact, almost any natural disaster now seems to have been aggravated by human activity. Floods in South America last week, caused by an exceptionally active El Niño, have pushed 100,000 people from their homes. It’s a sobering reminder that, for all the suffering in England this week, the costs of the rich world’s extravagance are still mostly borne by the poor.",diasaster:0},

Aged 38, he worked at the reception desk at the Palm Marina, one of a cluster of luxury hotels at the northern end of the Tunisian resort of Sousse. Sahloul was born just a stone’s throw away, in the picturesque Port El Kantaoui, and as he grew up he had watched hotel construction eat its way up from Sousse to envelop the port, bringing prosperity with it. Trained in information technology, he had worked for 11 years at the Palm Marina, throughout the 2010 Arab Spring revolution that toppled dictator Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali, bringing democracy but also chaos and upheaval to Tunisia. The Tunisia quartet: how an impossible alliance saved the country from collapse Read more Then in March two suicide gunmen rampaged through the capital’s Bardo museum, slaughtering 23 people. Sousse held its breath, fearing the attack would sweep away the tourists. But summer kicked in and the coaches arrived once again. “Life was very good, life was very nice, we had a lot of guests,” says Sahloul. “A lot of the British people come back year after year.” They are not likely, however, to do so next year. On 26 June, a serene day of sunshine, blue skies, tourists lounging by the pool, the picture changed in an instant. Suddenly, Sahloul remembers, “everybody was running in from the beach, waving arms, shouting”. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Empty sun loungers on the beach in Sousse. Photograph: Andreas Gebert/DPA/Corbis A thick wall of glass behind the Palm Marina’s reception desk blocked the sound of screams and shooting. On the beach, gunman Seifeddine Rezgui was mowing down tourists with a Kalashnikov. Sahloul stood transfixed, the scene unfolding like a silent movie in front of him. He bolted out from behind the desk, through the lobby, down a set of steps and outside, arriving into bedlam. Panicking tourists rushed past. The air was filled with the staccato hammer of gunfire. Tunisia beach attack: local heroes now face unemployment Read more Sahloul struggled through the panicking throng to the beach. To his left, outside the Imperial Marhaba hotel, dead and dying tourists were lying amid bloody overturned sun loungers. Pounding across the sand, he found Allison Heathcote, a British woman from Felixstowe who had come to Sousse for her 30th wedding anniversary. Using his first aid training, and common sense, Karim cleared Heathcote’s airway and kept her talking, determined she would not pass out. He found a discarded water bottle and used beach towels to staunch the blood. She survived, despite suffering five bullet wounds, and became known as a “miracle patient”. Her husband, Phil, was killed in the massacre, along with 37 others, 29 of them also British. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Holidaymakers lay flowers on Marhaba beach, where 38 people were killed in a terrorist attack. Photograph: Jeff J Mitchell/Getty Images The rest of the day is now a blur in Sahloul’s memory; he recalls shouting for people to clear a path for the ambulance crew. Then police arrived, bodies were bagged up, and the shock kicked in. It has never truly subsided. For several weeks he had problems sleeping, images of slain tourists seared in his mind. Then came the second impact. The massacre saw visitors desert Tunisia en masse. Hotels closed, thousands were laid off, and in the months that followed, a depression descended on the former boom town. “Everything in Sousse depends on hotels – shops, taxis, markets – everything,” says Sahloul. “If the tourism disappears, big problem.” He was luckier than most: getting winter work on the security staff when the Palm Marina closed its doors in September. But like everyone in Sousse, he fears for the future, worried there will be no work if the hotels stay closed next year.

{ "title":"Rabbi Lionel Blue obituary", "content": "For more than 30 years Rabbi Lionel Blue, who has died aged 86, was one of the most respected religious figures in the UK, largely on the strength of the regular three-minute homilies he gave on the Today programme’s religious slot, Thought for the Day, on BBC Radio 4 at around 7.50am, usually on a Monday. Delivering the monologues in a frequently whimsical manner, invariably closing with a genial Jewish joke, Blue sent listeners off chuckling to the working week. He told an interviewer in 2004 that he liked to give people a reason to get up and face the day by offering enough spiritual stiffening not to dive back under the duvet. It was a style that made him, according to a poll in 2001, more esteemed in Britain as a spiritual leader than either the pope or the archbishop of Canterbury. Yet the gentle persona was at odds with a sometimes tormented personality. This gave substance and humanity to his spiritual reflections, but could also make him prickly. Interviews with him often mentioned his homosexuality because he always brought it up himself, though he would say: “I’ve never thought it a very gay thing to be gay.” He was the first rabbi to come out publicly, in 1980. His faith journey was tortuous and in his youth had led him at various times to being a Marxist and an atheist, then considering Christianity, before becoming reconciled to the Reform branch of Judaism. Blue was the grandson of Russian Jewish immigrants (the family name was originally Bluestein). He was an only child, the son of Harry, a tailor in the East End of London who was periodically out of work during the 1930s, and his wife, Hetty, a legal secretary. As a child he claimed to have played his part with his parents and the rest of the East End community in seeing off British Black Shirts marching in Stepney – he helped to pass round the tea – and to have lost his belief in God when the deity did not immediately answer his prayers by wiping out Hitler and Oswald Mosley. His mother was a dominating figure in his life. During his Christian phase she threatened to kill herself with his father if he converted, a threat repeated later when he decided to become a rabbi instead. Blue claimed she told him: “You are only doing it to spite us. We have worked our fingers to the bone to get you out of the ghetto.” She had wanted him to become a solicitor, while his father hoped he might become a boxer. Latterly she lived with him and his partner until her death in 1994. Blue was a lonely, bookish child. During the blitz he was evacuated, moving 16 times to live with families around the south of England during the first period of the war, but eventually returning to Hendon after his parents moved there in 1943. Study at Hendon grammar school was followed by a place at Balliol College, Oxford, to read history. A brief period of national service in the army ended when he was invalided out following a nervous breakdown over his homosexuality; a further crisis occurred at university for the same reason. For many years he underwent psychoanalysis. He later claimed to have had a passionate but chaste affair with a woman that only served to convince him of his homosexuality. His adolescent Marxism apparently ended at Oxford when, sheltering from the rain one day in the doorway of a building that turned out to be a Quaker meeting house, he was invited inside to sit contemplatively with a group of Oxfordshire farmers. The reawakening of faith led subsequently to his studying semitics at London University and to becoming a rabbi in 1960, having been one of the first rabbinical students at Leo Baeck College, Finchley, north London, named after a liberal Jewish German rabbi of the interwar period. He subsequently lectured at the college (1967-2013) and also became the convenor of the British Reform synagogues’ Beth Din, the ecclesiastical court (1971-88). As he told an interviewer later, initially the post helped shield his homosexuality: “I could scarcely excommunicate myself.” He told another interviewer: “I went along with religion for many years not believing it, because after all a lot of it is not believable, but as I went on in life I began to trust it more and more and it reshaped me, made me a much nicer person … the religion thing worked.” He claimed to be guided by a guardian angel whom he called Fred: “I hold his hand and we sit next to each other and we cuddle.” Blue’s first broadcast came in 1967 and he was a regular speaker in the Thought for the Day slot from the 70s onwards. His thoughts were seldom profound, often sentimental and never controversial, but they touched a spot for many listeners who appreciated Blue’s doubt and vulnerability – and his transparent sincerity. The jokes which invariably ended each talk were usually both funny and pointed and played to Jewish stereotypes: “Nazi to Jew: ‘You Jews are the cause of all the trouble,’ Jew to Nazi: ‘Yes, Jews and bicycle riders,’ Nazi: ‘Why bicycle riders?’ Jew: ‘Why Jews?’” His popularity as a radio broadcaster – on Radio 2 as well as Radio 4 – led to occasional television appearances, including a documentary, In Search of Holy England (1989), and to a string of lightly religious books with titles such as A Backdoor to Heaven, How to Get Up When Life Gets You Down, The Little Blue Book of Prayer and The Godseeker’s Guide. There were one-man shows in theatres around the country and two autobiographies: My Affair With Christianity (1998) and Hitchhiking to Heaven (2004). Blue’s radio appearances became rarer as his health declined, after two heart bypasses, two bouts of cancer, a hernia, Parkinson’s and epilepsy over a number of years. In 1994 he was appointed OBE. He had three long-term partners, the last of whom, Jim Cummings, shared his life from 1980 after they met when Blue placed an advertisement in Gay Times. They lived together in a cluttered terraced house in Finchley until Jim’s death in 2014. • Lionel Blue, rabbi and broadcaster, born 6 February 1930; died 19 December 2016",diasaster:0},

The region’s 2016 temperature has been 3.5C warmer than a century ago. In some locations the divergence from the long-term average has been an eye-watering 20C. On 21 November, the decline on the long-term average of sea ice extent for that day was 888,000 sq miles (2.3m sq km) – an area 10 times larger than the UK, but smaller than the long-term average. “Almost every year now we look at the record of sea ice and say ‘wow’, but this year it was like ‘three times wow’,” said Tad Pfeffer, a geophysicist at the University of Colorado. “This year has been a big exaggeration on the trends we’ve already been seeing.” These numbers have resonance for people who require dependable rhythms in the environment in order to survive. In remote Alaskan communities, the stores sell goods priced to reflect their journey – $20 for a pizza, $15 for a gallon of milk. If you can’t butcher a 1,000lb walrus because there is no sea ice to support both of you, then you might well be left hungry. “The window of opportunity for hunting continues to shrink,” Metcalf said. “The communities are worried about this because food insecurity is something we are now having to tackle every single day.” Murmansk's silver lining: Arctic city expects renaissance with ice melt Read more Metcalf grew up on St Lawrence island, a far-flung piece of the US that sits just 36 miles from Russia in the Bering Sea. The island is thought to be one of the last exposed fragments of a land bridge that connected North America to Asia during the last ice age. In 2013, the island’s two main communities managed to catch just a third of the walruses they normally do. Last year, Gambell, the largest settlement, snared just 36 – down from the 600 it could expect just a few years ago. Sea ice is further out from land than it once was and is becoming treacherously thin for hunters to traverse. Walruses, which require sea ice for resting and giving birth, often have to resort to heaving themselves on to crowded strips of land. These grand tusked beasts can trample each other to death in such conditions. “It’s not like the walrus populations are changing, it’s that the climate is changing the conditions,” Metcalf said. “We are trying to plan better but we can’t go out every day and hunt. We can try to adapt and hunt caribou or moose but it’s not easy. It comes at a cost to us.” Walrus catch graph The Arctic is warming at twice the rate of the rest of the world and there are “early signs” that this temperature increase is speeding up, according to Jeremy Mathis, director of the Arctic program at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Mathis moved to Fairbanks, Alaska, in 2007 and even in that time he has seen startling changes – the -40C winters he endured in the first few years have almost completely disappeared. “For people who live in the Arctic, there is no debate over whether their environment is changing,” he said. “We are seeing a destabilization of the environment in the Arctic. The ice is melting earlier and earlier and coming back later and later in the year. For people here that means a clear impact upon food security and their way of life.” Frost locked deep in the soils is melting, causing buildings to subside. Communities are seeing their coastlines erode and are increasingly exposed to lashing storms without the protective barrier of sea ice. Several Alaskan towns and villages are wrestling over whether to fight these changes or retreat to relative safety. Two coastal villages, Shishmaref and Kivalina, have voted to relocate while a third, Newtok, has taken the first tentative steps to do so. The warmth of 2016 – almost certain to be a global record – has added to the sense of haste. The regrowth of sea ice as Alaska enters winter has been so painfully slow that many communities will be left without a buffer to storms next year. Should a large storm hit, it could prove disastrous. Facebook Twitter Pinterest People and a dog hunt for ducks near Newtok, Alaska. Newtok has a population of approximately of 375 ethnically Yupik people. Photograph: Andrew Burton/Getty Images Such a calamity would at least free up money from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema). The cost of relocating a village of just a few hundred people is around $200m – a bill that neither the federal nor Alaskan government is keen to pick up. Some people in remote communities note, darkly, that a ruinous storm would at least be followed by federal dollars that would allow them to fortify or move. “These communities need to be moved as soon as possible before a large storm hits,” said Victoria Herrmann, managing director of the Arctic Institute. “There hasn’t been much guidance as to whether they can move or who will pay for it. There are around 230 villages affected by sea level rise and they will all need a plan over the next few years as sea ice continues to retreat.” It takes a certain stoic hardiness to live in a place of such frigid cold. But Herrmann said that even those who have had to adapt to changes in the past have found the unravelling of 2016 “very scary”. She added: “What we are seeing is incredible. It’s quite frightening in terms of what it means for the future.” Trump's transition: sceptics guide every agency dealing with climate change Read more A solution doesn’t appear imminent. The US has no national sea level rise plan, no system to deal with displaced people. Even as the country’s first climate change refugees emerge from within its own borders, the issue is very much on the sidelines. The incoming president isn’t sure what the fuss is about, vacillating between calling climate change a “hoax” concocted by the Chinese or simply claiming that “nobody really knows” if it exists. While the politics plays out, wrenching decisions will have to be made. “Having to move elsewhere is unimaginable,” said Metcalf. “As an elder told me the other day, we are not going anywhere. We’ve been here for centuries. But we may have to consider it, for the sake of our children and grandchildren.”",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"The Guardian view on climate change action: don’t delay", "content": "Temperatures in the Arctic in the last two months have hit more than 20C above normal for the time of year. Temperatures that unusual in the UK and Europe would produce 45C summers. As a result, sea ice has shrunk to levels that scientists describe as “off the scale”. Mapping the changes to the extent of sea ice over the last 40 years confirms that: on a graph, the lines are clustered together like threads in a hank of silk, warming and cooling in line with each other – until this year. This year’s line drops down like a thin thread dangling into the void. Arctic ice melt 'already affecting weather patterns where you live right now' Read more Extrapolating data from a single year must be done with caution. When El Niño boosted global temperatures to make 1998 the hottest year on record, a position it held until 2014, deniers claimed that this showed that global warming had “paused”. In fact, several years after 1998 came within 0.3C of the record. The rise of a huge 20C over normal in the Arctic, the region that acts as one of the most important regulators in the global climate system, means that all expectations must now be rewritten. Arctic snow and ice reflect heat back into space – the albedo effect. When there is less ice, less sunlight is reflected and the sea, newly exposed, absorbs more heat, which melts more ice, and so on in a cycle. This is of vital importance: it could represent a tipping point, beyond which the Arctic ice cap, by some projections, might soon disappear altogether in summer. This is not the only crucial climate role the Arctic plays. Sea and air currents swirling over and under the ice cool the globe and affect weather systems on the other side of the world, sometimes in ways that are still not fully understood. Sea ice extent line graph Arctic sea ice has recovered in extent from previous lows. But that does not tell the whole story. When temperatures are less volatile, sea ice forms in layers over multiple years to a thick and solid mass. Ice that forms under this year’s conditions is likely to be thinner and less stable than what it replaces, more vulnerable to another year’s warming and less effective as a temperature regulator. For these reasons, the current drastic melting of the Arctic cannot be regarded merely as an outlier. While the effects of an ice-free Arctic on global weather systems are still in the realm of known unknowns, it is a known known that they will be disruptive. The current Arctic temperature and sea ice charts look like the beginning of a whole new trend, one that could change the global climate system for ever. The imperative for action is therefore overwhelming. Reducing carbon dioxide is vital, and it is encouraging that annual emissions have been flat for three years. But now it is necessary to move further, faster. Some experts advocate cutting the amount of black, unburnt carbon – soot – as a matter of urgency. Much of this soot is borne by air currents to the Arctic, depositing it on pristine snow that turns black, and so more heat-absorbent. Some measures to stop soot, like capping coal-fired power stations and banning agricultural burning, are relatively easy. Others – cleaner vehicles and spreading the use of solar cookers in developing countries – might take longer. Sea ice then and now Getting rid of potent hydrofluorocarbon gases, commonly used in refrigeration, has the broad backing of governments and industry, and will buy time. Methane, often a byproduct of fossil fuel exploration, should be used as an energy source, or at least flared, which is less harmful. Cutting these “short-lived climate pollutants” could prevent 0.5C of warming over the next 30 years, the research suggests. These are opportunities that must be taken; they are necessary, though not sufficient. So governments should also convene an Arctic council to explore other ways of protecting the region. Driving progress demands just the kind of leadership that looks very much to have disappeared from the global scene. Vladimir Putin’s Russia has been laying claim to vast Arctic areas, anticipating the realms of new possibility for commerce – new shipping lanes, cutting thousands of miles from current journeys – as well as oil and gas exploration that an ice-free Arctic would open up. For Donald Trump, such an unfrozen Arctic might allow the US to control key shipping routes, and find new oilfields and gas fields. Mr Trump’s choice of Rex Tillerson, former head of Exxon Mobil and cheerleader for Mr Putin, as secretary of state is deeply worrying.

{ "title":"UK MPs unite to push for greater transparency from tax havens", "content": "The UK’s overseas territories face renewed pressure to abandon corporate secrecy after 80 MPs joined forces to demand greater financial transparency from offshore havens. The cross-party group is backing an amendment to the government’s criminal finances bill on Tuesday that would force Britain’s 14 overseas territories to introduce public registers revealing the true owners of locally registered companies. The move is expected to face fierce opposition from the handful of the UK’s overseas territories – including the British Virgin Islands, Turks and Caicos Islands and Anguilla – that have become some of the world’s most active secrecy havens. Bermuda is world's worst corporate tax haven, says Oxfam Read more Earlier this year, the Panama Papers scandal laid bare how offshore corporate secrecy regularly attracts illicit money flows linked to terrorism, corruption, money laundering, tax evasion, drugs and fraud. Some estimates have suggested as much as $32tn (£26tn) of the world’s wealth has been hidden offshore. The MPs’ proposal, which is being tabled on the last day before parliament breaks for Christmas, would effectively give all overseas territories until 2020 to introduce public registers. Earlier this year, many overseas territories refused to buckle under intense pressure from then UK prime minister David Cameron, who called for them to introduce registers. The MPs’ amendment is to be tabled by Labour’s Dame Margaret Hodge, former chair of parliament’s public accounts committee. It has won backing from a wide cross-party base of backbench MPs, including including Andrew Mitchell, the Conservative former international development secretary, and Nigel Dodds, the Democratic Unionist party’s Westminster leader. About 80 MPs – among them Greens, Liberal Democrats, Plaid Cymru, SNP and SDLP politicians – are due to add their voice to the amendment proposal. If such levels of support hold, it is expected to put intense pressure on the home secretary, Amber Rudd, to add her backing. Such a move could spark angry reactions from many overseas jurisdictions and could even provoke local politicians to call for a severing of ties with the UK. Many territories may question why the amendment does not extend to the UK’s crown dependencies, include as Jersey, Guernsey and the Isle of Man. It is extremely rare for the UK to use its special powers – known as “order in council” edicts – to impose laws on overseas territories. “Of course political parties have shied away from using these powers. They can seem somewhat colonial,” said Hodge. “But I think there are overwhelming moral arguments at stake here. “The Conservatives used them to outlaw capital punishment; Labour used them to get rid of laws against homosexuality. Now we are facing another big moral issue ... Over half of the corporate entities exposed by the Panama papers were registered in the BVI, a British overseas territory. “The UK is at the centre of a global web of tax havens which are costing UK taxpayers and developing countries huge sums of money.” There are at least seven Tories supporting the amendment, led by Mitchell, who is calling on Theresa May’s government not to let the momentum for reform, built up by Cameron, fade away. “I hope this amendment will help the UK government to persuade the overseas territories to adopt the same level of transparency as the UK,” he said. “This is so important for people in developing countries who are losing out due to tax dodging.” Sally Copley, the head of campaigns for Oxfam, the anti-poverty charity, said a number of developing world charities were backing the move. “These tax transparency standards are essential to hold the overseas territories accountable for their policies’ impact on other countries – especially the poorest, which are hardest hit and have the most to lose from tax dodging,” she said.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"UK floods and extreme global weather linked to El Niño and climate change", "content": "From some of the worst floods ever known in Britain, to record-breaking temperatures over the Christmas holiday in the US and and forest fires in Australia, the link between the tumultuous weather events experienced around the world in the last few weeks is likely to be down to the natural phenomenon known as El Niño making the effects of man-made climate change worse, say atmospheric scientists. El Niño occurs every seven to eight years and is caused by unusually warm water in the Pacific Ocean. This year’s event is now peaking and is one of the strongest on record, leading to record temperatures, rainfall and weather extremes. Army called in as floods continue to devastate northern England Read more “What we are experiencing is typical of an early winter El Niño effect,” said Adam Scaife, the head of Met Office long-range forecasting. “We expect 2016 to be the warmest year ever, primarily because of climate change but around 25% because of El Niño,” said Scaife, who added that the phenomenon was not linked directly to climate change but made its effects worse. Scientists have warned for years that extreme weather would become more common as a result of climate change, but have until recently fought shy of attributing single events to global warming. But researchers at Oxford University and the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute (KNMI) calculated earlier this month that man-made climate change was partly responsible for Storm Desmond’s torrential rain, which devastated parts of Scotland, the Lake District and Northern Ireland. The scientists ran tens of thousands of simulations of the flooding event and found it 40% more likely with climate change. Facebook Twitter Pinterest A wildfire burns out of control on Christmas Day in Victoria state, Australia. Photograph: Keith Pakenham/AFP/Getty Images The UN’s World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) also expects 2015 to be the hottest year on record worldwide, with Europe experiencing its second hottest year. It was marked by heatwaves in India, Pakistan and elsewhere. The latest floods, droughts and extreme weather are what might be expected of a strong El Niño, according to the WMO. “Severe droughts and devastating flooding are being experienced throughout the tropics, and subtropical zones bear the hallmarks of this El Niño,” said the organisation’s chief, Michel Jarraud. “Much of eastern Europe has been exceptionally warm, with temperatures higher than in 2014. Only in parts of Ireland were temperatures lower than the 1981 to 2010 long-term average, according to the climate indicator bulletin from WMO’s European regional climate centre. The widespread El Niño effects are are now being felt in Africa, Latin America, Indonesia and Papua New Guinea, the WMO said. Record US temperatures are work of El Niño and polar vortex, experts say Read more In Central America, one of the most severe droughts on record has left 3.5 million people in Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador in need of food aid. The UN says that more than 2 million people have been affected in Peru and Ecuador. In Ethiopia, the government estimates that 10.2 million people will need help in 2016 at a cost of $1.4bn (£944m). Elsewhere in Africa, staple crops have been devastated in Kenya, Malawi and South Africa. Food shortages are expected to peak in southern Africa in February. “Over 39 million people in Africa are expected to face food insecurity by January 2016, an increase of more than 70% on January 2015”, said a spokeswoman at the Department for International Development. The warm Pacific temperatures have also led to a record number of hurricanes and cyclones. According to the US government’s national oceanic and atmospheric administration, there were 18 named storms in 2015, including 13 hurricanes, nine of which were category three or higher. This is the highest number recorded since reliable measurements started in 1971. In the US, many states experienced record high December temperatures. The mercury reached 30C (86F) in Tampa, Florida; 28.3C in Houston, Texas, and 18.8C in New York. “Extreme weather will increase with global warming and thus climate adaptation measures, like flood defences, need to constantly be updated. What may appear to be sufficient to withstand a 1 in 100-year event can become quickly out of date as the incidence of extreme weather ramps up and becomes more unpredictable,” said Gail Whiteman, the chair of the Pentland centre for sustainability at Lancaster University.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"We need a Dutch-style Delta plan to stem the tide of floods", "content": "When more than 1,800 people died in the wake of the 1953 North Sea flood in the Netherlands, the national reaction was: never again. The resulting Delta programme to close off the south-western river delta from the sea was so bold that its name became synonymous with dealing with a crisis. If an issue needs a major response, you can be sure that a Dutch politician will call for a “Delta plan to tackle X”. It is time that the UK took some of that attitude and got a Delta plan to tackle flooding. Flooding has become an almost annual event in the UK. We are waiting for the next storm and flash flood to hit, with another group – or even the same group – of people evacuated, all followed by the promise of some money for a bit of flood defence work. As a nation, we can no longer afford to accept that. Consider the personal misery for those affected, even in areas not traditionally flood-prone like Manchester and Leeds. Consider that the financial cost of these events will continue to rise – and not only for the government. Every home insurance policy now includes a £10.50 Flood Re levy to subsidise insurance for homes with a high risk of flooding. With the climate changing and becoming more volatile, we can expect heavier rain and more severe storms. Water management systems in the UK, and in particular in England, are unable to deal with what lies ahead. Storm Eva: severe flood warnings in place as rain drenches northern Britain Read more After almost every flood, journalists and policymakers go to the Netherlands to learn how they are adapting to climate change and what lessons there are for the UK. We see Dutch projects in the news, such as a neighbourhood with floating homes that forms part of a major national programme to create space for the rivers. But those lessons never seem to be taken on board. Come the next flood, off they all go to Holland again. For the Dutch, water management goes to the core of their national identity. The country was forged in the battle against water. This common fight led to the pooling of resources and decision-making in regional water authorities – among the oldest democratic institutions in the world – which continue that work today. The national habit of consensus decision-making in tackling major issues became known internationally in the 90s as the “polder model”, echoing its water-based roots. No Dutch politician wants to be part of the generation that fails in the common endeavour against water, and no voter would accept someone caught sleeping on their watch. The Netherlands has adapted to the changing nature of the threat. Today, the biggest danger is not the sea swallowing the land but the rain overwhelming it. The main focus no longer is building higher dykes and bigger dams, like they did after the 1953 flood. Instead, the Dutch have spent the past decade deepening and widening rivers, creating new side canals that provide extra capacity, and setting aside land as dedicated flood plains. This €2.3bn (£1.7bn) project is still ongoing. All this so that when the water does come, the swollen rivers can expand without flooding homes and causing misery. In Britain, we need to start to realise and accept that flooding is becoming an equally existential issue. There can be no northern powerhouse or sustainable prosperity anywhere if it risks being swept away by the rain. That message is not always clear in Westminster, where the focus is on the quick fix today. The polder model feels far away from the much more combative nature of Westminster – and from Holyrood and Cardiff, too. We need a Dutch-style national response in the UK, with the necessary funding. The British landscape demands it even more than the Dutch flat countryside. With heavy rainfall flowing down the hills into lower-lying areas, those places need investment in rivers and landscapes able to absorb that water, transport it away from homes quickly or temporarily store it on empty flood plains. We need to stop building in at-risk areas, setting those places aside as buffers to protect existing homes. When and wherever we build, we need to think about how we manage water in that area. This will require some tough decisions and difficult public debates. The respective environment agencies in England, Scotland and Wales have much of the expertise, but need the political will and funding. A start would be a UK Delta plan. But first the prime minister and the first ministers of Scotland and Wales must truly resolve: “never again”.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"2016 will be a year of living dangerously for the global economy", "content": "Economic forecasting is a mug’s game. One thing that has been learned from the financial crisis and Great Recession is that even those equipped with the most sophisticated models get it wrong, sometimes spectacularly. So it is with both humility and trepidation that I will try to fulfil a promise made last week and make predictions for what is going to happen in 2016. In all honesty, the future is unknowable and anybody who says otherwise is lying. So, with that caveat, here’s what I think might happen. At some point, a recovery built on booming asset prices, weak growth in earnings and rising personal debt is going to lead to another huge financial crisis - but not in the next 12 months. Instead, 2016 will be a year of living dangerously, papering over cracks and buying time before all the old problems resurface. Oil price falls to 11-year low with global glut expected to deepen in 2016 Read more Here’s why. The big story of the past month has been the collapse in oil prices, which has taken the price of crude back to levels last seen in 2004. This has two beneficial effects for the global economy. It provides additional spending power for households and businesses that consume energy, and it bears down on inflation. There is always a bit of a delay between oil prices falling and spending going up in response, in part because people want to be sure that the lower costs are going to stick. It is, however, now 16 months since crude began its decline from its August 2014 peak of $115 a barrel, and there is a good chance it will fall a bit further from its current level in the mid-$30 a barrel range. With no sign that the oil cartel, Opec, has the political will to agree production curbs, it is quite possible that prices could fall below $30 a barrel in the early months of the year. The impact of that will be to keep inflation lower than any of the world’s major central banks are anticipating. Policymakers at the US Federal Reserve, the Bank of England and the European Central Bank (ECB) insist they “look through” rises and falls in oil and other commodity prices and make their interest rate judgments on the basis of what is happening to core inflation, which excludes energy and food costs. But it is harder to raise interest rates if, for whatever reason, inflation continues to undershoot official forecasts. More importantly, there is evidence that a fall in inflation caused by cheaper oil has an effect on wage bargaining. When, in the pre-crisis years, UK inflation regularly hit the government’s 2% target, employers used to offer pay awards of 4%. Now that inflation is zero they see no reason to offer more than 2%. That matters because central banks are looking for signs of wage inflation picking up as a result of years of steady growth and falling unemployment. If wage inflation does not go up, there is less of a reason to raise the cost of borrowing. So prediction number one for next year is that both inflation and interest rates will stay lower for longer than currently anticipated. The Fed raised interest rates for the first time in almost a decade earlier this month, but will be extremely cautious about its next move. The Bank of England will hold off from its first move. Cheap money will boost both borrowing and – for a time – growth. Five factors that shook the world’s markets in 2015 Read more The next theme of 2016 will be China, where the question is not whether the pace of growth will slacken, but by how much. Expert opinion differs about the state of the world’s second biggest economy. Some analysts say Beijing has everything under control, others that the country is already having a hard landing from years of overinvestment in unproductive manufacturing plant and speculative real estate. It is hard to know exactly what is happening in China, a big country with a reputation for unreliable economic statistics. Official data says the economy is growing by 7% a year, yet data for electricity consumption and rail freight suggest the actual figure is lower. But whereas official interest rates are zero or thereabouts in the major developed countries of the west, in China they are still above 4%. This gives the People’s Bank of China scope to cut the cost of borrowing if it wants to stimulate growth, a scope it will almost certainly use if the government thinks the economy is slowing too rapidly. The exchange rate can also be cut to make Chinese exports cheaper, and the country also has the option of raising public spending. The risk, of course, is that China cleans up the mess caused by one collapsing bubble by inflating another, which is what Alan Greenspan did in the US in the early 2000s. Here, then, is a second prediction. China will slow in 2016 but policy easing will prevent a collapse. Over the past six years, the eurozone has shown an unerring ability to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory. Every time the crisis has appeared to be over, something nasty has happened. In 2016, that “something” could be Greece, caught in a debt and austerity trap, it could be rudderless Spain or moribund France. There are a couple of reasons, however, why the eurozone might stumble through to 2017 before there is fresh trouble. The first is that it will benefit from the delay in tightening policy in the US and the UK, and from pro-growth measures in China. The second is that the ECB will keep using quantitative easing in the hope that an increase in the supply of money will get the banks lending. The ECB is also keen to drive down the value of the euro to boost exports, although this may prove more difficult if the Fed raises interest rates more slowly than the markets currently expect. There is a good chance the dollar will fall rather than rise against the euro. The biggest immediate risk to the global economy comes from the emerging world, especially those parts of it affected by the crash in the cost of commodities. Brazil has debt rating cut to 'junk' status as problems mount Read more Brazil is the country to watch out for. It is the biggest economy in Latin America and in serious trouble. The economy is contracting at its fastest rate since the 1930s, inflation is above 10%, the currency has collapsed and the finance minister has just resigned. A visit from the International Monetary Fund may be unavoidable. This is a case of history threatening to repeat itself, because the buildup to the 2008 crisis began on the periphery of the global economy. So, here is my final prediction: there will be no explosion in 2016, but a fuse will be lit.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"The innovators: US scientists harness the power of evaporating water", "content": "A small Lego device on the shelf of professor Ozgur Sahin’s office at Columbia University could open up the possibility of another form of renewable energy, and one that is much cheaper than solar and wind. Sahin has used the simple gadget to prove that evaporating water can be used to generate power, which could eventually lead to energy being generated from still reservoirs. At the centre of the research by Sahin and his team in New York are spores of common soil bacteria that expand, much like a muscle, when there is moisture in the atmosphere, and contract in drier conditions. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Columbia University’s device uses evaporating water to harness energy Photograph: Columbia University In 2009, Sahin started to investigate whether there was a practical application to this expansion and contraction. By putting thin layers of the spores on plastic tapes and controlling the amount of moisture in the air, they expand and contract very quickly, creating movement on the tapes. By putting a large number of tapes together, they produce an energy force that can be captured. In the case of the device which now sits on his office shelf, Sahin coated a rubber sheet with spores. By putting a glass of water beside it, the sheet changes its curvature with the moisture in the air, and pushes and pulls on a seesaw mechanism. This motion was then converted into electricity using a coil and magnet. To the naked eye, there is nothing happening to the water, but molecules leave the surface in a constant process of evaporation. With open bodies of water, such as reservoirs or lakes, they are eventually replenished with rain. “A device can sit at the interface where water is evaporating. It can pick moisture from the water surface and give it to the dry air and take some energy,” he says. Facebook Twitter Pinterest This device has shutters that open and close, allowing moisture to escape. Photograph: Columbia University With that proof that the system could work, Sahib and his team then developed other devices using the same principles. An “evaporation engine” sits on the surface of the water and as moisture enters the device, the spores on plastic tapes curve and open shutters, allowing moisture to escape from the unit. When the shutters close again, the moisture fills the device and the system starts again. Another device called a “moisture mill” has spore tapes placed around a wheel. As the spores start to flex, the device starts moving. One of the possible uses for the technique is on reservoirs where there is a substantial amount of evaporation, particularly in drought-affected areas. In Los Angeles, millions of black plastic “shade balls” were placed on the surface of a reservoir to reduce water loss. Sahin says long sheets of plastic painted with the spores could be stretched across parts of the water and generate power while at the same time reducing the amount of water lost through evaporation. “What we are envisioning is flexible spore-based materials that float on the surfaces of reservoirs that stretch from one end of the reservoir to the other. Then there is a generator on one end that produces electricity as it expands and contracts over the surface,” he says. Scientists build toy car propelled by evaporating water Read more The set-up costs of the evaporation method would be cheaper than other renewable energy sources such as wind and solar, he says. Enough spores to cover a 10m by 10m area would cost less than $1. With more funding to expand the research into other areas, possibly by using swimming pools, he says the system could be useable on a large scale in between 10 and 15 years. “We have shown that all of the parts work together in the lab. There could be problems if you go from lab to the real environment, but for that you just need to test it and identify it and you cannot do that until there is more research funding on this,” Sahin says. At present, there are just three people working on the project, he adds, a number that would need to increase tenfold to develop it further. In theory, the volume of energy that can be produced is similar to solar power, he says.

Some would argue that it’s impossible not to. But it is worth remembering that Sir Michael Wilshaw, the outgoing chief inspector of schools, who has had this powerful position for almost five years, was a bit power-mad going in. In 2011, at an interview panel of MPs, he likened himself to Dirty Harry, the Clint Eastwood anti-hero cop who is the epitome of ruthless policing and never hesitates to cross professional boundaries in his quest to get justice. It was an unusual choice. As his time in office comes to an end, another Eastwood film perhaps provides a better framework for assessing his record: the Good, the Bad and the Ugly. From the start of his tenure, Wilshaw had a habit of making comments that shocked people: accusing teachers of skiving off at 3pm, saying “bad parents” should be fined. But there was always an odd vulnerability to him. When interviewed, he would say he didn’t mean to upset anyone, they just misinterpreted his intentions, which in his eyes were always pure. We are still letting down our poorest pupils, says Ofsted boss Read more Despite his headline-grabbing soundbites, Wilshaw has done plenty of good at Ofsted. Three years ago, the organisation’s reputation was near the floor. At teacher conferences, anyone uttering the O-word could hear audiences bristle. Insulting it guaranteed applause. Schools were confused after decades of endless fiddling with complicated and inconsistently applied rules. Contracted inspectors, hired via third-party companies, varied in quality: some were caught copying and pasting reports, and selling extra wares for high fees. Training of inspectors was patchy. But their judgments could end careers after new government rules allowed the removal of school leaders given low grades. After nearly five years under Wilshaw, Ofsted is no longer in this mess. Inspectors are trained in-house. They have been banned from selling consultancy services, restoring faith in their independence, and a new framework makes it clearer what is expected of schools. Parents like the organisation. Surveys run by inspectors show that 95% of parents know the brand and 88% believe its reports are reliable. Half have read a report in the past year. What is unclear is the extent to which Wilshaw is responsible for this improvement. He has rarely discussed these processes directly, instead leaving the Ofsted director Sean Harford to employ his remarkable listening skills on social media and at events, to mop up teachers’ concerns. Harford’s dogged determination has turned even angry Ofsted-haters into sympathisers, but he has barely received a mention from Wilshaw among the valedictory interviews and speeches. This is not a new trope. In 2015, when I interviewed Wilshaw about the opening of his first academy, I asked who aided him during difficult times. He declined to name anyone. “It sounds very arrogant to say I didn’t need much help, but I knew all the pitfalls,” he said. Wilshaw will take credit where he sees fit, though. In a recent Observer interview, he said when he arrived at Ofsted, seven in 10 primary schools were rated good or better; now it is in nine in 10. He attributed this to Ofsted’s hard work. “We introduced greater demands into the system, had higher expectations and teachers and heads have risen to it,” Wilshaw said. Where is the evidence that Ofsted drove the improvement? Schools have undergone hundreds of changes in the past five years, including the criteria on which they are inspected. The figures are incomparable. In fact, how do we know he didn’t just make it easier to pass? All of which shows the bad side of Wilshaw’s tenure: the dual problems of arrogance and gut feel over evidence. Arrogance, in particular, may have caused myopia in areas he knows less well. Special educational needs were a particular blind spot. Having started a trend of writing an annual report, launched each year in a big media event, he managed to miss out special educational needs schools completely in 2014. The further education community, also inspected by Ofsted, was likewise offended this year when Wilshaw told parliament he would prefer all 16- to 19-year-olds to be educated in schools, a few weeks after saying colleges were “inadequate at best”. The opinion had scarcely any evidence behind it. The Guardian view on Sir Michael Wilshaw: ruffling the right feathers | Editorial Read more His reliance on personal anecdotes over facts has also led to him focusing on pet peeves. He has repeatedly lambasted north of England schools for pupil underachievement. As research from Education Datalab shows, swaths of the north actually do rather well (for example, Hull), while some parts of London still do badly (such as Enfield). One can only hope his successor, Amanda Spielman, whose research background is strong, will rebalance this tendency. Which leads us to the ugly. Ofsted’s biggest black mark of the past few years was its handling of the Trojan Horse scandal, in which several Birmingham schools were first given good or outstanding ratings, then quickly downrated to “inadequate” after allegations of extremist activity. An independent review by parliament’s education committee concluded that this move undermined confidence in the watchdog. At the time, Wilshaw passionately defended such actions and this year, he publicly warned that radicalism was still occurring in Birmingham schools. “It has just gone underground,” he said. Since then he has started to campaign against “illegal” faith schools, which operate without a licence and often have poor standards, and written to the education secretary about the number of “missing children” who leave schools each year without any record of their whereabouts. Wilshaw is not wrong about this. As a country, we are failing the thousands of children who disappear from school rolls each year. But the unwillingness to take responsibility for Ofsted’s failures in the Trojan Horse case plus his forthright language have damaged morale and arguably slowed progress in the cities he criticised. No doubt, Sir Michael would put his hands in the air and say he didn’t mean any offence. If only he had learned how not to cause it in the first place.",diasaster:0},

There was a time, not so very long ago, when he was hoping to be our next prime minister, before defeat in the general election saw him relegated to backbench obscurity. Now a photograph of the former Labour leader blowing his nose has been broadcast on US television as an example of a generic “man with flu”. Apparently taken at the party conference in 2011, the image shows Miliband clearing his nostrils with a large white handkerchief. Though his features are partly hidden, it clearly shows the then Labour leader. Unaware of who he was, however, producers at NBC News used the photograph as a stock image to introduce a news report about flu vaccinations. “Flu season has arrived, and there are fresh concerns tonight that many school districts are seeing an uptick,” said the newsreader, while the image of Miliband mid-blow hovers over her shoulder. “There’s concern that not enough people are getting a flu shot, and health officials have new guidance about the nasal vaccine.” It is not the first time that Miliband has fallen foul of a rogue photograph. He was widely ridiculed after an unflattering picture of him eating a bacon sandwich became one of the key social media memes of the 2015 general election campaign. In a speech to party members shortly after the photograph was taken in 2014, he said: “You could probably ... find people who look better eating a bacon sandwich. If you want the politician from central casting, it’s just not me, it’s the other guy.

As the Strictly Come Dancing final was taking place on the BBC, over on Channel 4, Father Ted actor Ardal O’Hanlon pottered around Britain in search of the remarkable trees shortlisted for the Woodland Trust’s Tree of the Year competition. O’Hanlon’s casting implies that giving prizes to trees is a marginal interest, but TOTY is growing vigorously and he extracted some quirky comedy from proceedings. “Can I sample your juice?” he asked a Bramley apple seller in the Nottinghamshire town where this cooking apple tree was accidentally born. But TOTY also showed how individual trees become central, celebrated members of our communities – revered elders that cause us to give thanks for life on earth. There’s Old Knobbley in Essex; the Ding Dong tree in a Scottish playground, around which three generations of children have played a unique game of “it”; and the Bicycle tree in the Trossachs, which swallowed a bike. According to local legend, a young man leaned his bike against the tree for a blacksmith to repair, went off to the first world war and never returned to reclaim it. 2016 Woodland Trust tree of the year shortlist - in pictures Read more A fable for our times is the UK’s winning tree: the Brimmon oak in Powys. Generations of local farmer Mervyn Jones’s family have treasured this stout-trunked sentinel; a portrait of his forebears’ wedding in 1901 was taken in front of it. The Brimmon oak was in fact due to be destroyed by a new bypass – until it was spotted by Rob McBride, an enthusiast known as “the tree hunter”, who identifies ancient trees. He launched a campaign, and earlier this year the Welsh assembly announced it would realign the bypass around the tree. So what will 31st-century archeologists make of the remnants of a road that bent around an ancient tree? Did 21st-century society worship trees? Not exactly, but in an era of environmental devastation our awareness of something mightier than ourselves is a heartening sign of our better nature. Benefits for badgers? An ad break during TOTY showed a real-life badger nosing around a coffee machine as part of the John Lewis Christmas ad campaign. This is bitterly ironic timing since the government has just announced the slaughter of 10,866 badgers in the three months to October – almost certainly a more intensive killing spree than at any moment in the long and vexed history of humans and badgers in Britain. I vacillate between welcoming any onscreen depiction of nature, and wishing that animals were somehow copyrighted so that they could benefit from our exploitation. John Lewis is giving money to the Wildlife Trusts as a “thanks for the animals” but it could go further and refuse to stock produce sourced from pro-badger cull farms. This year I’m buying Christmas gifts from Lush – one company that has the guts to campaign against the badger cull.

{ "title":"Zsa Zsa Gabor obituary", "content": "The name of Zsa Zsa Gabor, who has died aged 99, is redolent of glamour, wealth, hedonism and campy elegance, but not much to do with acting. Although she appeared in some 30 films, Gabor was the embodiment of the phrase “famous for being famous”. She was once called “the most expensive courtesan since Madame de Pompadour” by a US congressman after she received expensive gifts from Lieutenant General Ramfis Trujillo of the Dominican Republic. (She claimed that all she had done was accept a Mercedes-Benz and a chinchilla coat from him, while his country had received a $1.3m loan from the US government.) Gabor had one of the best collections of diamonds in the world, and married nine times. “I don’t believe in living in sin, so I always got married,” she explained. She was born Sári Gabor into luxury in Budapest. Her date of birth is disputed but most commonly given as 1917. Gabor was brought up with her sisters, Magda and Eva. “I came from a glamorous family. Even my grandmother was a glamorous woman,” she said. Their father, Vilmos, an ex-officer in the Hungarian army and a landowner, was in the diamond business, and their mother, Jolie (20 years his junior), was in the business of wearing them. “All my daughters’ lovers also want to sleep with me,” she once said. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Zsa Zsa Gabor in Moulin Rouge, 1952 In 1936, Gabor entered the Miss Hungary beauty contest, which gained her the attention of a fellow Hungarian, Alexander Korda, who offered her a film contract. However, the family forbade her to become an actor, so she married Burhan Belge, a Turkish diplomat, and went to live in Ankara. They travelled a lot and on her first visit to Britain, in 1938, she was flattered by the attention paid to her by George Bernard Shaw and HG Wells. After divorcing Belge, she moved to the US and married the hotel tycoon Conrad Hilton in 1942. She was 30 years younger than Hilton and, at first, they did not understand a word they said to each other. He gave her a used Chrysler as a wedding gift because “his friends at the country club were always telling him that I married him only for his money and he started to believe it. So to try me out, he bought me that old car. He was always saying that I wanted his money when all I really wanted was his love, so I left him.” Gabor, who had her only child, Francesca, by Hilton, was also angry when he refused to name one of his hotels after her. By divorcing Hilton, she missed becoming the mother-in-law of Elizabeth Taylor who married Conrad Hilton Jr in 1950. Gabor’s third husband was the suave actor George Sanders, whom she married in 1949. Meanwhile, Gabor began a film career of sorts. “I love to act, darling,” she said in her thick Hungarian accent. She took drama lessons from Constance Collier at MGM. One of her best roles was in John Huston’s Moulin Rouge (1952). Looking the image of a Toulouse-Lautrec painting, she played the cabaret singer Jane Avril, whose singing was dubbed by Muriel Smith. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Zsa Zsa Gabor in Lili, 1953. Photograph: Allstar/MGM In Lili (1953), she was the wife and alluring assistant to a magician played by Jean-Pierre Aumont, causing pain to a smitten waif (Leslie Caron). Gabor was then quite happy to play a lovely stooge to Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis in Three Ring Circus (1954), and to cavort with Sanders in Death of a Scoundrel (1956). Two appalling films in the late 1950s made Gabor a camp icon. The Girl in the Kremlin had her playing a double role as twin sisters. She did not play the title role in Queen of Outer Space (1958), but was cast as a rebel Venusian in a slit skirt who falls in love with four earthmen whom her man-hating queen wants to destroy. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Zsa Zsa Gabor in For the First Time, 1959. Photograph: Allstar/MGM Gabor and Sanders divorced in 1954. Sixteen years later, he was briefly married to Magda. Zsa Zsa’s next three husbands were wealthy businessmen: Herbert Hutner (1962‑66), Joshua Cosden Jr (1966-67) and Jack Ryan (1975‑76), the inventor of the Barbie doll. She then married the attorney Michael O’Hara (1976-82) and the actor Felipe de Alba, although that marriage was annulled as she was still wed to O’Hara. She married a socialite, Frédéric Prinz von Anhalt, in 1986. “It’s wonderful in Europe being called ‘your royal highness’. Otherwise, I don’t give a damn about it,” she claimed. “To tell you the truth, I would prefer to live in America and just be plain old Zsa Zsa Gabor.” It was through her marriages, her debts, her court cases and her witty appearances on chat shows – when asked how to prevent men from straying, she said, “Shoot them in the legs” – rather than her (mostly cameo) appearances in films, including Orson Welles’s Touch of Evil (1958), that Gabor remained in the public eye. In 1993, she was ordered to pay more than $1m in a slander case brought by the actor Elke Sommer. A few years earlier, she had grabbed headlines when she was convicted of assaulting an LA cop after being stopped for a traffic violation. “He was unbelievably rude,” she said. “He used language that no man should use toward a woman – and for no reason, except that the tag on my car had expired. I didn’t speed; I didn’t do anything. And when he became rude, I just forgot he was a policeman and looked at him as just a man who was insulting me. So I lifted my arm, but I never hit him. I should have, though.” Facebook Twitter Pinterest Zsa Zsa Gabor on ITV’s Des O’Connor Tonight in 1988. Photograph: Freemantle/Rex/Shutterstock In 2005, Gabor accused her daughter of larceny and fraud, alleging that Francesca had forged her signature to take out a $2m loan on Gabor’s Bel Air house. However, the court threw out the case due to Gabor’s refusal to appear in court. In 2010, Gabor was admitted to hospital in a serious condition and received the last rites from a Catholic priest. The following year, her right leg was amputated above the knee to save her life from an infection. She was admitted again in 2011 for numerous emergencies and in the years before her death suffered from severe ill-health. Her books included How to Catch a Man, How to Keep a Man, How to Get Rid of a Man (1970) and One Lifetime Is Not Enough (1992). Summing up her life, she said: “Hungarian Gypsies believe that Z is the luckiest letter in the alphabet, and I have two in my name. So I’ve been doubly lucky, darling!” Francesca died in January last year. She is survived by Frédéric. • Zsa Zsa (Sári) Gabor, actor, born 6 February 1917; died 18 December 2016",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"I have a dram: meet the whisky micro-distillers springing up across Scotland", "content": "A new wave of Scottish whisky distilleries are hoping to cash in on the surge in interest in artisan, handcrafted whiskies that has conquered cities across America. In a deliberate shift from their traditional ties to the Highlands and Hebridean islands, malt whisky distilleries are now opening for the first time in a century in cities such as Glasgow and Edinburgh, to target younger, urban audiences and connoisseurs who search out locally produced, artisan spirits. The Scotch Whisky Association estimates that more than 40 small new distilleries are setting up across Scotland, in a trend mirroring the rapid rise of craft brewing that has reinvigorated the UK’s beer industry, and in handcrafted, flavoured gins. Liam Hughes, the co-founder of the Glasgow Distillery, which borrows its name from the city’s last-surviving distillery that closed in 1902, said his company had seen the sudden success of micro-distilling in Brooklyn, which is now home to at least eight craft distilleries. “It’s all very much about bringing malt whisky back to the city,” he said. “Watching what was happening in the United States and Tasmania, Australia, there was a real upsurge in craft whisky that links backwards to the ‘think local’, ‘think provenance’ trend in food manufacturing. “People are fed up with major multinational brands and looking for something with some provenance, that can connect with local people. We want to bring metropolitan distilling back to Glasgow.” William Wemyss, a specialist whisky bottler and exporter whose family – one of Scotland’s oldest aristocratic families – is opening one of two new distilleries close to St Andrews at Kingsbarns, said whisky drinkers in the UK and overseas are now far more demanding. “It’s all farm to table, it’s all craft,” he said. “The traceability and provenance of a small distillery [is what customers want]. There’s no growth left in the big, heavily marketed makes.” His distillery will build its provenance by using local Fife-grown barley, partly sourced from his family farms nearby. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Copper stills at the Glasgow Distillery. Its first malt will not be on sale until September 2018 at the earliest. Photograph: Murdo Macleod for the Guardian In the US, the number of craft distilleries has grown from about 60 a decade ago to an estimated 600 or more making whiskies, bourbons, vodka, gin, rum and more exotic spirits such as absinthe, producing one-off batches and “expressions” with unusual barrels and carefully sourced grains and flavourings. Scotland’s distillers will also be taking barrels from across the world: port, rum and sherry casks, sauternes or muscatel wine barrels, virgin white oak and bourbon casks. The Glasgow Distillery’s appeal will be based largely on using water from the vast Loch Katrine, which has supplied the city’s population since 1859. There are plans for a second new distillery and visitor centre in Glasgow near Zaha Hadid’s Riverside Museum on the Clyde. Urban micro-distilleries are also springing up in Arbroath, Falkirk, Glenrothes, South Queensferry and near Greenock, as well as on numerous islands: Raasay and its neighbour Skye, Harris, Lewis and Benbecula on the Western Isles, and Orkney and Shetland. The surge in new distilleries is driven by the global success for Scotch whisky of all types: it is now the UK’s single largest food and drink export. Sales fell last year, but the overall trend has seen single malt export values nearly triple in the past decade, from £352m in 2004 to £915m last year. Scotch whisky industry ‘bigger than UK iron and steel or computers’ Read more Despite the growth in distilleries, some of the new generation may not survive. Distillers have to invest upfront for their equipment and, unlike cheaper, grain-based, blended whiskies, many prefer their malt whisky to age for at least seven years in wood barrels – without earning a penny. With this in mind, micro-distilleries bring in immediate cash by building visitor centres with viewing windows on to the distillery, selling “new make” spirit – the high-strength, unaged whisky spirit straight from the stills – or distilling and flavouring their own-label gin, which can be made quickly and cheaply in weeks. Some are bottling malt whiskies using outside suppliers, others are drawing in wealthier whisky enthusiasts by selling them entire barrels of unaged whisky as an investment or, like Kingsbarns, offering them exclusive rights to the first bottles. The Glasgow Distillery’s first malt will not be on sale until September 2018 at the earliest; it is marketing its gin to to the city’s theatres and five-star hotels, along with a high-strength, heavily aged single malt whisky it calls Prometheus. Stuart Nickerson, a businessman hoping to open Scotland’s most northerly whisky distillery at the former RAF radar base at Saxa Vord in Shetland – the first legal distillery on the islands – is selling gins flavoured with locally grown apple mint and then seaweed. He wants to source local barley with Shetland’s agricultural college. David Robertson is looking to launch Edinburgh’s first urban whisky distillery in more than 90 years close to Holyrood Park, near the site of the city’s last single malt distillery, which closed down in 1925. Robertson was until recently the master distiller for The Macallan, one of the best-known malt whisky brands, and he is looking forward to creating one-off batches. “I’m much more excited about being a bit more experimental,” Robertson said. “It will be alchemy rather than science. Part of the reason I’m so excited about putting a distillery in an urban environment is to showcase the distillery to visitors from overseas, from Edinburgh, further afield in Scotland or parts of the UK.” • This article was amended on 29 December to make clear Prometheus is a single malt whisky not a whisky blend.",diasaster:0},

Expect to see tracksuits, vests and bright diagonal stripes, as Rio 2016 fever takes hold of fashion-aware wardrobes. The starting pistol was fired at Paris fashion week, where the French label Chloé had fashion editors swooning over its luxe tracksuit tops. If autumn 2015 was defined by Gucci’s furry loafer – a surreal shoe that reflected the season’s fondness for brainy, faux-vintage glamour – the tracksuit looks likely to characterise spring/summer 2016. “It’s such an easy look,” says Justin O’Shea, the buying director of the luxury online retailer MyTheresa.com, who believes the eyebrow-raising £1,000 price tag for the Chloé top will not put a certain kind of customer off, even if an Adidas zip-up might suffice for the rest of us. “Everyone wants to be comfortable at the moment,” he says. “There were tracksuits at Gucci and Hillier Bartley. You can guarantee Karl Lagerfeld will be putting them on the Chanel catwalk soon.” The tracksuit is also a winner in menswear, according to Simon Chilvers, the style director at matchesfashion.com: “It’s set to become the rollneck for next season, a great layering piece under a lightweight coat or jacket and it ticks the 1990s box, which is a headline trend for spring/summer.” Facebook Twitter Pinterest Lacoste’s latest collection is inspired by athletes draped in their national flags.

According to the market research firm Euromonitor, global sales of sports-inspired clothing were up 6% year on year in 2014 to $22bn. Euromonitor’s apparel and footwear analyst, Bernadette Kissane, says the boom is tied to “changing consumer attitudes towards health and wellness and an upsurge in sports participation”, much of which was precipitated by the 2012 Olympics. Kissane believes the trend is set to continue. “Firstly, comfort can provide more momentum for a trend, and secondly, athleisure is being driven by a permanent change to people’s lifestyles, rather than being merely a fad,” she said.

On Monday he unveiled details of Ireland’s appeal, sent to the EU courts in Luxembourg last month. In a nutshell, Noonan simply refuses to accept that Apple’s corporate arrangements in Cork, which have regularly generated two-thirds of the global profits for the US company, have been in any way exceptional. Nor is it at all odd that these handful of Cork-registered companies have been able to claim “stateless” income – that is, their profits are beyond the jurisdiction of any state to tax. Apple is expected to take a similar line when it lodges its own appeal: that no rules have been broken, and that the company is the victim of a political attack that retrospectively and unreasonably unpicks tax treatments which have endured for decades without objection. Having come so far, and with so much at stake, it is hard to imagine Apple and Ireland throwing in the towel and conceding in the EU courts. That said, with each fresh round of public disclosures about the iPhone maker’s tax structure, it looks more and more indefensible on any measure. At this rate, US critics of Vestager’s meddling may well have cause to reassess. Instead of calling the commissioner out for overreaching her powers, they may instead question the inaction of the Inland Revenue Service. Why is it, after all that the IRS is pursuing Amazon and Facebook through the US courts over their European tax structures, but have never challenged Apple?",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"'Faithless electors' explain their last-ditch attempt to stop Donald Trump", "content": "On Monday, the 538 members of the electoral college will gather in state capitols across the country to cast their votes for the next president of the United States. With 306 electoral college votes under his belt to Hillary Clinton’s 232, that person will almost certainly be Donald Trump. The iota of doubt that remains comes from an unprecedented eruption of discontent from electors, the body of 538 people chosen by the two main political parties to cast the electoral college vote. Under the peculiarities of the American system, the president is not chosen directly by a “one person-one vote” policy: indeed, Clinton won the popular vote on 8 November by some 2.9m ballots. The electoral college: why it exists, how it works and can it stop Trump? Read more Instead, it is the indirect electoral college vote, parceled out by a complicated formula and awarded to the candidate who won each state, that is the final arbiter of who occupies the White House. This year, at least eight of the 538 have indicated that they intend to break ranks with modern tradition and vote against their party in a protest directed squarely against Trump. All but one of those rebels are Democratic, which is not coincidental. Many of these Democrats see the electoral college as the last-ditch hope of stopping Trump – the idea being that if their example can encourage their Republican fellow electors to follow suit and rally around a compromise alternative candidate, the Trump presidency can yet be abated. The chances of that are exceptionally slim. The only Republican rebel to come out so far is Christopher Suprun, an elector from Texas. On the Republican side, nobody knows the extent, if any, of a potential uprising by electors beyond him. A survey by Associated Press found little enthusiasm among Republican electors for joining the rebellion. Yet the Harvard law professor Larry Lessig said this week that at least 20 Republican electors were seriously considering defecting. No names of that elusive 20 have emerged and no one knows how many will actually carry through with the protest by voting for an alternative Republican to Trump. All that we do know is that 2016 will go down in the history books as a seismic year for the electoral college. Here, six of the so-called “faithless electors” who intend to rebel on Monday explain in their own words what is driving their historic action. Polly Baca, 75, Colorado Polly Baca. Photograph: Facebook In June 1968, I was in the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles when Robert Kennedy, who I was working for as a campaign staffer, was assassinated. Kennedy was my hero and I was devastated by his death. But the despair I had then doesn’t even come close to how I’m feeling now. Today I’m afraid for my country. I’m afraid that we will be propelled into another war. My fear of Donald Trump is that his intent is not to ensure that the US is solid and safe and a leader in the world, but to aggrandize himself and make money. I had the privilege when I was younger of going twice to the Soviet Union as a guest of the American council of young political leaders. I learned there that the main factors that distinguish a dictatorship are efforts to destroy freedom of assembly and freedom of speech and the press. Those are precisely the same freedoms that Trump has been attacking relentlessly. As electors, we have the responsibility to stop him. I would love to see 37 Republican electors vote for Hillary Clinton on Monday – after all, she did win the popular vote. But if we can’t get that, then I am willing to support a viable Republican alternative. Christopher Suprun, 42, Texas Though Donald Trump won my state of Texas, I’m intending to write in a different Republican candidate when I come to vote. I haven’t decided yet who that will be. I know that I am not alone. There are other Republican electors who are considering voting for a not-Trump candidate who have talked to me about it. I am very comfortable that I will not be the only Republican on Monday voting according to their conscience. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Christopher Suprun. Photograph: Evans Caglage/The Dallas Morning News Donald Trump is a demagogue. He is not thinking about our national wellbeing or security. Rather he appears to be profiting from foreign connections that are forbidden under our constitution. Our founding fathers specifically created the electoral college to protect smaller states from the tyranny of the majority. Electors should have a deliberative role – otherwise, why not just use jelly beans or bricks to deliver the final decision? Since I announced my intention to vote according to my conscience, I have received about half a dozen death threats against me and my family. More happily, a person I’ve known for years who traces his ancestry back to the American revolution told me he thinks his forebears would have been proud of what I’m doing, which made me feel pretty good. Bret Chiafalo, 38, Washington state Stopping Donald Trump is an emergency. It’s a moral imperative – we simply have to prevent a man like Trump from being elected to the presidency. There’s thousands of reasons why I say that. He has shown himself repeatedly on Twitter, in his phone call to Taiwan that overturned decades of diplomacy, in his clear ability to hold a grudge about the smallest of slights, that he is incapable of controlling his feelings. Such hot-headedness can cause wars. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Bret Chiafalo. Photograph: Elaine Thompson/AP I’d also point to the way he seems to be influenced by foreign powers. The founding fathers specifically warned us about that when they framed the electoral college. Russia is only one such example of the conflicts of interest that stand between Trump’s business holdings around the world and the country’s interests. It is assumed that electors must just vote sheep-like for the party candidate who wins their state. But I believe in the rule of law. Between the constitution and Federalist 68 – Alexander Hamilton’s treatise that sets out the purpose of the electoral college – it is clear that we have the duty to block anyone who is unfit for the presidency. I stand to be fined up to $1,000 by the state of Washington. That’s a lot of money. But a thousand bucks versus a moral imperative – no contest. Levi Guerra, 19, Washington state When I signed up to be an elector in May it was at a time of great conflict within the Democratic party between Hillary Clinton supporters and Bernie Sanders supporters. But we all managed to come together around one promise: no Trump. That was the pledge I made when I joined the electoral college – that I would do everything I could to block Trump. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Levi Guerra. Photograph: Courtsey of Levi Guerra This is the first time I’ve been old enough to vote in a presidential election. I expect elected officials to keep their promises and I think it would be wrong not to hold myself to the same standard. So I’m doing everything in my power to keep that pledge. That means casting my electoral college ballot not for Clinton, who won my state of Washington, but for a compromise Republican candidate who other Republican electors can rally around to stop Trump getting elected. This is not about the Democratic or Republican party; it is about unifying us all for the benefit of the country. For the longest time, the electoral college has been a mysterious thing for so many Americans. Since our action started, many more people have started to think about the system and debate how it could be used to protect what we hold dear. Vinz Koller, 53, California I’ve been in DC this week and I went to look at the original Federalist Papers and in particular Federalist 68. There’s something about seeing the actual documents, realizing how prescient the founding fathers were. They certainly knew about the threat of foreign influence, about how foreign powers seek “to gain an improper ascendant in our councils”. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Hillary Clinton and Vinz Koller. Photograph: Barbara Kinney/Hillary for America I leapt when I read that. It’s what we have right now: a candidate who during the campaign invited the Russians to spy on us and use cyberwarfare against our country. Donald Trump encouraged that to happen, and the evidence that we have suggests that’s precisely what Russia did. It strikes me as remarkable that documents that are more than 200 years old could have anticipated something like that happening. The founding fathers also feared what they called “the little arts of popularity”. I take that to mean populism and demagoguery. They were afraid of a snake oil salesman running for the highest office – and frankly, that’s what we got. Monday will be a test of what the electoral college was created for. If ever there’s a moment in which we should be exercising our power to act in the face of danger, it is this one. Micheal Baca, 24, Colorado People have called me a “faithless” elector. I want to push back on that: I’m a conscientious elector or faithful elector. I believe I’m being faithful to the constitution by being true to my conscience, rather than just being a rubber stamp. I believe Donald Trump to be a demagogue and that the majority of Americans would have a different Republican in the White House. That’s not overturning the result of the election that the Republicans won, but it is standing up to a clear and present danger. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Micheal Baca. Photograph: Courtesy of Michael Baca So I am putting my country above my party and coming together with Republican electors. The hope is that we can unite around a more responsible Republican to lead this country. When Bret Chiafalo and I came together over social media to form the Hamilton electors, some time around 3am on 9 November, we knew this would be a long shot. But since then the odds have moved considerably in our favor. We’ve sparked a national debate. People are starting to understand that electors are individuals, not just numbers on the map. Whoever is inaugurated as president on 20 January, I will fully support them and respect the office they hold. Even if that person is Donald Trump. I want our country to be the greatest. But at least I’ll know that I did everything I could, through sheer will and a heck of a lot of help.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Italian government to request bank bailout funds from parliament", "content": "The Italian government is laying the groundwork for a potential €20bn rescue of the country’s most troubled banks, including Monte dei Paschi di Siena (MPS). A government statement issued late on Monday night said that the prime minister, Paolo Gentiloni, had convened a cabinet meeting to request the funds from parliament. The statement said: “[It] could be necessary to adopt measures with the aim of protecting savers if there were risks in the financial sector”. The vote in parliament could happen as soon as Wednesday, according to the Italian news agency Ansa. The news signals that a multi-billion euro refinancing of MPS could occur within days. Seven other banks that are struggling under the weight of bad loans amounting to billions of euros may also require government recapitalisation. The cabinet meeting was convened just hours after MPS, the world’s oldest bank, formally launched a desperate attempt to stave off government rescue and raise €5bn (£4.2bn) from private investors. It has less than 10 days to secure private funding before the government intervenes. The bank’s shares fell 8.5% on Monday as it launched a share offering to institutional and retail investors. This measure runs alongside a plan to ask bondholders to swap their investments for shares, and a restructuring of €28bn of bad loans to clean up its balance sheet. However, with the clock ticking on wooing private-sector investors to support the fundraising, one of the key backers of the bank’s planexpressed doubts. Monte dei Paschi bailout: what you need to know – the Guardian briefing Read more MPS announced that Quaestio, which manages the government-orchestrated bailout fund Altante, is concerned about the terms of a loan to support the parcelling-off of bad debts. The move could jeopardise the entire capital-bolstering exercise, which must be completed by the end of the year because of a deadline imposed by the European Central Bank after MPS was found to be the weakest performing of 51 European banks subjected to stress tests – a financial health check – in results published in July. MPS said: “If it is not possible for the bank to reach an agreement with Quaestio to resolve the issues that it has raised, the transaction would not be able to be completed in accordance with the terms and conditions of the authorisation of the European Central Bank which provides for the transaction to be completed by 31 December 2016.” The bank has become the focus of fears about the Italian banking system, which is saddled with €360bn of bad debts amassed in recent years during a period of economic weakness. UniCredit, Italy’s biggest bank, last week announced plans to raise €13bn in a record-breaking share issue and axe 11% of the workforce. Those concerns have mounted after Italy’s referendum on constitutional reform earlier this month led to the resignation of the prime minister, Matteo Renzi, creating fresh political turmoil in the midst of MPS’s attempts to attract major investors to its fundraising. This fuelled fears that the Italian government would have to step in to help save the country’s third biggest bank in a move that could force thousands of private investors, who hold €2.1bn worth of bonds, to take losses. New EU rules intended to protect taxpayers from bailing out banks mean that bondholders must take a hit before government money can be used. The Italian government has made clear it is ready to act as backstop to MPS, although last week Rome insisted the bank would be able to raise the funds through the markets. The announcement that Quaestio had concerns came just hours after the cash call on shareholders was announced. MPS said the body had, on 17 December, “expressed strong reservations in relation to the term sheet” of the loan. MPS said it was in talks with Quaestio – which runs the €4.25bn Atlante backstop fund named after the Titan in Greek mythology who was condemned to hold up the sky – to try to resolve the matter. Atlante is backed by the Italian banking system: Unicredit pumped in €1bn to the fund, as did Intesa Sanpaola. Carlo Messina, chief executive of Intesa Sanpaolo, was quoted as saying that the MPS deal should go ahead and that a decision would be reached by Tuesday at the latest. In the meantime, the share offer for institutional investors closes on Thursday, while retail investors have to decide whether to buy shares by Wednesday. The Thursday deadline has sparked speculation that the Italian government might step in before the end of the week if it emerges that investors have failed to buy shares. If the Italian government had to stump up cash it would constitute a “precautionary recapitalisation” because the bank holds enough capital to meet current regulatory minimums.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Indian police torturing suspects, says HRW deaths in custody report", "content": "Indian police are torturing suspects – including using sexual abuse, forms of waterboarding and beatings with a “truth-seeking belt” – a Human Rights Watch investigation has claimed. A report released by the rights group on Monday says more than 590 suspects died in police custody between 2010 and 2015, and though mistreatment was alleged in many cases, no police officers have been convicted in that time. Rules intended to curb the number of deaths in custody, such as bringing a suspect before a magistrate within 24 hours of their arrest, were routinely ignored, it says. In one case highlighted in the report, police said a man named Shyamu Singh killed himself in custody in April 2012. But his brother, who was also arrested, told investigators the pair were held down by four officers while another “poured water down my nose continuously”. “Once they stopped on me, they started on Shyamu,” he said. “Shyamu fell unconscious. So they started worrying and talking among themselves that he is going to die. One of the men got a little packet and put the contents in Shyamu’s mouth.” Police told Singh’s family that he had died by consuming poison. An internal investigation cleared police of any involvement in his death, but an initial inquiry by state authorities concluded that seven police officers had tortured and poisoned the 35-year-old to death. Nonetheless, all seven were exonerated in the final report. In another case, one of 17 featured in the report, a police head constable admitted that a suspect in a counterfeiting investigation had been beaten with a satyashodhak patta, or “truth-seeking belt”. Mumbai's infamous police 'encounter squad' dream of comeback Read more “Since he was a hardcore criminal, he refused to give any information on the source of those fake currency notes seized from him. But it was essential to get that information from him,” Atmaram Gurav is quoted as saying in the report. “He was so weak after the beating that when he got up to drink water, he was dizzy with pain and collapsed against the window, breaking his lower jaw.” Procedures to investigate deaths in custody are regularly flouted, the report says. Less than a third of the 97 deaths in 2015 led to a judicial inquiry, and in 26 cases no autopsy was conducted. The New York-based rights group says there are police oversight bodies to investigate such cases, but they have “largely failed” in their role. More than 430 cases of deaths in police custody were reported to India’s National Human Rights Commission between April 2012 and June 2015. The NHRC recommended more than a total of 22m rupees (£260,000) compensation in the cases, but no prosecutions. “Police in India will learn that beating suspects to confess is unacceptable only after officers are prosecuted for torture,” said Meenakshi Ganguly, Human Rights Watch’s south Asia director. The report makes several recommendations including that India set up a witness protection programme to encourage victims of police violence to come forward without fear of retribution.",diasaster:0},

John Beeden arrived in Australia after more than 200 days at sea, and said he had not realised the trip would be so difficult. He set off from San Francisco in June and expected to take between 140 and 180 days to cover the 6,100 nautical miles to Cairns in north-eastern Australia. Bad weather slowed the 53-year-old down, however, and he eventually reached his destination in 209 days. John Beeden (@solopacificrow) Arrived at 10am local time. Happy to be on land have some ginger nuts. #solopacificrow #adventure #cairns #australia pic.twitter.com/3tdDfrK5Lc December 27, 2015 Beeden, who is originally from Sheffield but now lives in Canada, had already rowed across the Atlantic. According to his website, he took 53 days to cover 2,600 nautical miles, the second fastest such crossing on record. “To be the first person to achieve something on this scale is incredible, really. I haven’t processed it yet … I thought I was going to be here mid-October and it was going to be hard work but just like the Atlantic – it wasn’t going to try to kill me. But it tried a few times,” he told reporters after landing. “It’s been difficult the whole way but, in fairness, that was what I was looking for. I just didn’t realise it was going to be so difficult. “I did the Atlantic three years ago and, although it was hard work, I found the actual process of doing the 53 days relatively easy, in a sense. It was just hard work. So, I went looking for something more difficult to push me to the edge. “I have peered right over the edge a number of times.” He told Sky News that each day on the water presented him with “some massive challenge”. He said the crossing was “10, 15, 100 times harder than I thought it would be”. Peter Bird rowed from San Francisco to Australia solo and non-stop in 1983, but did not make landfall. He was rescued by the Australia navy close to the Great Barrier Reef, but made it close enough to land to be recognised by the Guinness Book of World Records as the first person to row across the Pacific solo. Beeden said that the record he set was of less interest to him than the challenge of making it across the ocean. According to the BBC, his wife Cheryl, who met him in Cairns, said: “He’s an amazing guy. He’s different than a lot of other people. He’ll always fight to get the mile when he’s having a bad day … He’ll always be rowing. “Always knew he could do it, it just took a lot longer than we expected and just glad that he’s home and safe. “He says he’s not going to get in another boat for a while, but I am sure in a couple of weeks he’ll be having some other adventure, and I will have to restrain him a little bit.” She told reporters that her husband’s achievement was incredible, adding that she had been living with it for seven months. But she knew he could do it, she said. After finally arriving safely, Beeden accepted the congratulations of the people of Cairns and thanked them.

{ "title":"Brutal Bolshoi: inside the troubled world of Russia’s legendary ballet", "content": "What do the Bolshoi and the Kalashnikov have in common? According to a new documentary exploring the aftermath of an acid attack at the legendary ballet company in 2013, they are the two brands that define modern Russia. The film, released in the UK on 8 January, was shot during a time of much soul-searching at the institution and examines what the assault on its artistic director, Sergei Filin, says about the broader state of Russian politics. Bolshoi Babylon is released on 8 January in the UK. “It was such an unusual story when it broke, even by the standards of the Russian underworld,” said one of the film’s directors, Nick Read, speaking at the Copenhagen documentary film festival CPH:DOX, where the film had its European premiere. “Acid is not a commonly used weapon. That’s why I was so curious, and why it created a profound curiosity inside Russia. Everyone was scratching their heads. It lifted a lid on this bottle of snakes.” Bolshoi dancer Pavel Dmitrichenko jailed for six years over acid attack Read more He and fellow director Mark Franchetti had just finished shooting their first feature length documentary together about an isolated prison for serial killers in Russia’s Urals, when a principal dancer was charged with the attack. The pair negotiated access to film the Bolshoi over the 2013-2014 season as the theatre brought in new leadership influenced by figures high up in Vladimir Putin’s government and tried to restore its tattered reputation. The official story was that the dancer Pavel Dmitrichenko had orchestrated the attack by two thugs because his girlfriend had been passed over for the lead role in Swan Lake. Her teacher had been Nikolai Tsiskaridze, a veteran dancer who was bitter at having missed out on the top job. “How these dancers are cast is not always based on merit,” says Read. “It’s about who you are loyal to, who you butter up and who patronises you. That’s the legacy of a communist past. People are forced to get themselves noticed, and that’s why other tactics come in, and allegations of sexual favours, corruption and so on.” Brand Bolshoi The film delves into the Bolshoi’s culture of intense partisan divisions, which more recent pressures to become a commercial entity in the capitalist era have deepened. Dancers now freelance to supplement their basic pay, with fierce competition for plum roles. “We spent a lot of time trying to work out how precise a mirror it was of the political landscape,” says Read. “I’m still undecided. It’s intensely political and has been used as a pawn by the regime, but at the same time it’s a reality bubble. The walls are very thick.” We spent a lot of time trying to work out how precise a mirror it was of the political landscape. I’m still undecided Nick Read Facebook Twitter Pinterest Competition for lead roles inside the company is intense. Photograph: Bolshoi Babylon for the Guardian Read describes the mutations the Bolshoi has undergone. “During the Cold War they were the harbingers that glorified Mother Russia and were sent abroad as an icon of soft power. Even during glasnost and perestroika they were sent to the White House to dance before Gorbachev came to meet Reagan. “Then in the Yeltsin years, when the state structures were dismantled, organised crime coalesced, and the oligarchs appeared. The Bolshoi had to move with the times. Even though they are state-funded, they were impoverished because the whole economy was destabilised, and they had to start touring far more heavily,” he said. This is when “Brand Bolshoi” came in. “Now they’re much more aspirational as an institution, as are the dancers themselves,” the director said. Divisive figure The human drama of Bolshoi Babylon comes from the tension between Filin, Tsiskaridze and Vladimir Urin, the new head the Kremlin brought in from the Stanislavsky Theatre. Charged with restoring control and instating a new and transparent casting system, Urin’s trepidation is palpable in the film. Read said: “You’re in the firing line if you’re head of the Bolshoi. It’s an intensely politicised role. I’m sure you know enough about Putin’s political style to know what happens if you step out of line.” Read said of the “deeply contradictory” Urin: “On the one hand he’s a loyalist and the other a maverick. I asked him once if he believed in democracy and he just laughed at me, which is a sort of communist disposition. People of his generation are quite, shall we say, ambivalent about democratic principles. It’s a hard line, a disciplinarian ethos.” Although they were granted access, the Bolshoi is not an open book. “I regularly got lost in there,” Read says. “There are 3,000 people working inside, which was frankly quite intimidating.” Facebook Twitter Pinterest Sergei Filin, the Bolshoi’s former artistic director, who was seriously injured in the 2013 acid attack. Photograph: Bolshoi Babylon/The Calvert Journal There was also initial reticence among dancers about discussing the acid attack. “We started off talking about their discipline, fear of injury and short career spans, all things in common with dancers anywhere. It took a long time to build the trust to ask the questions we really wanted to ask. “Although there are lots of professional jealousies, they are all diehard loyalists to the institution. They know it’s never going to get better in their world than dancing at the Bolshoi. But in talking to us they certainly felt there was a cathartic process going on that they had to get to the other side of,” Read said. There were also egos to contend with. “Filin was extremely difficult to deal with,” says Read. “He was recovering from an extremely serious injury, so to begin with he was having treatment and just wasn’t around.” Bolshoi artistic director returns after acid attack to reveal new ballet season Read more The former director was unavailable to everyone, Read said. “He’s the only character in the building who operates from behind a locked door. This is why he’s such a divisive figure. He was a great dancer, but who says great dancers can become great managers.” Despite the scandal and intrigue at the heart of the story, Bolshoi Babylon avoids a definitive or lurid take on the acid scandal and its aftermath. “Brought up in an observational tradition, I’d rather the audience make up their own minds,” says Read. “But seeing the deeply politicised interplay at close quarters is a unique window onto an institution balanced on a knife-edge between high-culture virtuosity and the brutal nature of aspiration in modern Russia.” As one Russian commentator says at the beginning of the film: “Not many brands represent Russia. One is the Bolshoi Ballet, the other is the Kalashnikov [rifle].” A version of this article first appeared on The Calvert Journal, a guide to the new east",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Ticket resale websites run risk of fines after CMA launches inquiry", "content": "Ticket resale websites and the touts who use them could be fined after the competition watchdog launched an investigation into how the best seats are harvested and then sold on at huge mark-ups before fans can buy them at face value. The Competition and Market Authority said it was examining suspected breaches of consumer law after reviewing the four secondary ticket companies – Viagogo, StubHub, GetMeIn and Seatwave – that sell on previously purchased tickets. It will examine several areas of concern in the secondary ticketing market, including whether touts use “connections” at resale websites to gain an advantage over fans, such as information that helps them decide which tickets to market aggressively. Ticketing websites 'acting like old-fashioned fences', say MPs Read more The probe follows increasing scrutiny of the sector by MPs concerned about the inflated prices at which tickets are being sold. Earlier this month hundreds of tickets to see Adele next summer appeared on resale websites for up to £9,000, the latest in a string of in-demand events seized on by the UK’s most successful touts. Andrea Coscelli, acting chief executive of the CMA, said: “A night out at a concert or a trip to a big match is something that millions of people look forward to. So it’s important they know who they are buying from and whether there are any restrictions that could stop them using the ticket.” “If we find breaches of consumer law, we will take enforcement action,” he added. Rules introduced in 2015 require ticket resellers to provide details of the block, row and seat number, as well as the face value and information about any restrictions. Last year, the CMA secured pledges from the main websites that they would improve the information provided to buyers. The CMA said one site failed to comply with the demand to provide such information. GetMeIn, Seatwave and StubHub said they were not the site in question. Switzerland-based Viagogo did not return a request for comment. The watchdog has powers to force firms which breach the law to provide undertakings to improve their behaviour, while the courts can impose fines on those who do not. The CMA’s investigation will also turn the spotlight on the touts, who are already facing the prospect of a tax investigation by HMRC. Those found to be concealing their identities or ticket details could face court-imposed fines. A CMA presentation given recently to the Society of Ticket Agents and Retailers, seen by the Guardian, states that even the very act of bulk-buying tickets for resale is illegal. This is because anyone masquerading as a consumer for the purpose of business is in breach of the Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations 2008. The CMA’s probe will also examine whether major touts, some of whom were named in an investigation by the Observer, are exploiting “connections” at ticket websites. A whistleblower from one resale site said touts are sometimes handed inside information to help them grab the best seats at must-have concerts. Consumer body Which? urged the CMA to stake strong action. Vickie Sheriff, director of campaigns and communications at the consumer body, said: “On numerous occasions we have found tickets being sold unlawfully, so we welcome the competition authorities taking action to tackle this.” Labour MP Sharon Hodgson, who chairs the All Party Parliamentary Group on Ticket Abuse, said it was “paramount that enforcement action is taken seriously and swiftly”. She also called on the government to tackle “bulk purchasing” by touts, amid calls to criminalise the use of ‘bots’, automated software sometimes used to buy large numbers of tickets. Despite the CMA’s probe, some ticketing experts expressed disappointment. Music industry group FanFairAlliance said: “UK audiences will continue to be frustrated that measures to genuinely fix ticket resale are not being taken sooner – and while other countries take swift and decisive actions, British fans continue to be ripped off by touts operating under cover on the Big Four resale sites. “We call on the government to respond to recommendations made in the Waterson review on secondary ticketing, and welcome the potential of a full inquiry by the select committee in the new year.” A government-commissioned review by Prof Michael Waterson concluded this year that ticket resellers that do not comply with last year’s rule changes should be taken to court. The government has yet to respond to the review. Security consultant Reg Walker, who recently testified to MPs about “ticket abuse”, cast doubt on the CMA’s assertion that most ticket sites are now complying with consumer protection laws. “Given the information in the public domain about all four websites, I fail to see how any are fully complying with the Consumer Rights Act, let alone just one.” Walker called on the CMA to demand firms hand over records of the touts who use them, to establish whether they are breaking the law.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"New antisemitism definition is justified", "content": "I was shocked by the letter (17 December) from Tony Greenstein and others about the government adopting the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance definition of antisemitism. The letter said: “The new definition has nothing to do with opposing antisemitism, it is merely designed to silence public debate on Israel’s crimes against the Palestinians. Antisemitic incidents comprise about 2% of all hate crime. Why then the concentration on antisemitism and not on Islamophobia, which is far more widespread?” Those assertions are all either misleading or false and seem to say that antisemitism in Britain doesn’t matter. It is true that religiously based hate crime represents a very small percentage of all hate crime. In 2015 out of about 66,000 hate crimes in the UK, about 5,000 were on grounds of religion and, of those, about 1,000 attacks each were antisemitic and Islamophobic. Both types of attack are as abhorrent as each other. The British Jewish population is less than 10% of the size of the British Muslim population, so the Jewish community is facing far more frequent racist attacks pro rata than the Muslim community. In fact, the attacks on the Jewish community are concentrated on those who are easily identified as being Jewish, including those going to or from Jewish community centres, events or synagogues. Secular Jews are frequently unaware of such attacks. The new definition of antisemitism that the government has adopted specifically states that “criticism of Israel similar to that levelled against any other country cannot be regarded as antisemitic”. It does, however, define “applying double standards by requiring of it a behaviour not expected or demanded of any other democratic nation” as antisemitic. Is that what they want to do? There is nothing in the new definition that would stifle legitimate criticism of Israel. When unjustified criticism of Israel is published in the media, such as the false report of a massacre in Jenin, antisemitic attacks in the UK increase, so this new definition is needed. Islamophobia does not increase in response to reports of the Israel-Palestine dispute. It does increase in response to reports of jihadi attacks in the west. That is also unfair on Muslims in Britain who are strongly opposed to terrorism. But it is no reason to make light of antisemitism in Britain. Stephen Franklin London • Deplorable though the Netanyahu government’s settlement policy is, the description by the usual pro-BDS suspects of Israel as “an apartheid state” is ludicrous. This is a country whose minority Arab citizens have, and exercise, the vote, are represented in the Knesset, local government, the judiciary, academia and the press, and whose religion, whether Muslim or Christian, is freely practised. That is not to say more does not need to be done to enhance provision for Israel’s Arab citizens, especially the Bedouin, but it would be a welcome change if those who constantly denounce Israel for failings real, exaggerated or imagined spent a fraction of their energy protesting about the slaughter in Syria, many of whose citizens are being treated in Israeli hospitals, or the actions of Hamas and Hezbollah. Jeremy Beecham Labour, House of Lords • My question to the letter’s signatories is simple: how many of you have actually visited Israel? If you have had any kind of in-depth visit to Israel, you must have noticed how many Arabs study at its universities. How many of the doctors and teachers are Arab. How many checkout staff in the supermarkets are Arab, working side by side with Israelis. Do you see separate seating on buses and in public places for Arabs and non-Arabs? No. That is what apartheid was, and it is not practised in any shape or form in Israel.

The Bangkok Post reported that authorities suspected an unnatural death. The man was wearing a wetsuit and flippers, and had 1,500 baht (around £34) on him.

His body was found about 200 metres off Samae, a popular beach on the island of Koh Larn, near Pattaya, one of Thailand’s biggest seaside resorts.

Pattaya police said they had not received a missing person report and were still seeking help in to identifying the body, showing local residents a photograph of the man and checking CCTV in the area. “The most important thing right now is to find out who he was,” Apichai told the Bangkok Post. “Anybody who can give information about the man to police can contact Pattaya police station any time.” In the UK, the Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123.

{ "title":"Logical problems with oaths of allegiance", "content": "For over 350 years Quakers in Britain and elsewhere have refused to take oaths (I do hereby swear to go on mocking gesture politics, 19 December), because they imply a double truth standard (Matthew 5:37). Quakers will not swear oaths in court (or elsewhere) but will “affirm”, which is legally binding but not religious. It would be ironic if the imposition of an oath intended to support British values had the (presumably unintended) effect of removing Quakers from any form of public service, especially since the particular British values mentioned (toleration, freedom and equality) happen also to be central Quaker values. Quakers established in law the right to affirm as long ago as 1695, and it would fit far better with the values that communities secretary Sajid Javid wishes to uphold if he had set aside the archaic language of “oath-taking” and instead used the much less loaded and more inclusive term “affirmation” to convey his opinion. Roger Wilson Billingshurst, West Sussex • Under the Papist Act of 1722, following a panic about alleged Jacobite conspiracies, Britons owning land were required to swear an oath of allegiance to the House of Hanover. Recalling the occasion subsequently, Arthur Onslow, Speaker of the Commons, noted “It was a strange as well as ridiculous sight to see people crowding to give a testimony of their allegiance to the government, and cursing it for giving them the trouble of so doing … I am satisfied more real disaffection to the King and his family arose from it than anything which happened in that time.” No similar exercise has ever been attempted subsequently. Sajid Javid, take note. Julian Harber Mytholmroyd, West Yorkshire • A well-known logic puzzle posits an island that contains two tribes: one always tells the truth, the other always lies. How does one tell them apart? Asking someone to take an oath to tell the truth will not do the job; the person will always accede to the request. I fear a British values oath would face a similar problem. Many states in the US introduced loyalty oaths for public employees during the McCarthy era.

{ "title":"The disastrous decisions behind troubles in prisons and probation", "content": "There is a contradiction in the argument that more prison officers will mean less trouble inside (Editorial, 19 December). The history of modern prison disturbances in England and Wales – from Parkhurst in 1969 through to Strangeways in 1990 – indicates that they occur for complex reasons. These prisons, and the others where disturbances have taken place in the last four decades, had their full complement of staff. Other disturbances occurred in prisons that were neither overcrowded nor privatised, and well-resourced financially. It is therefore crucial to get to the root of why prisoners revolt when they know, in Liz Truss’s cliched phrase, they “will face the full force of the law”. Prisoners knowing they faced the same consequences have not been deterred from revolting during this time. The point made by Frantz Fanon, cited by Black Lives Matter, can be applied to the prisons here: “We revolt simply because, for many reasons, we can no longer breathe”. Responding to what happened at Birmingham as a law and order issue, seeking retribution and dismissing critics as being pro-crime and anti-victim, will undoubtedly fail and have potentially catastrophic consequences for everyone inside. Professor Joe Sim School of Humanities and Social Science, Liverpool John Moores University The Guardian view on the Birmingham prison riot: a call for action | Editorial Read more • Prisons are shameful places, often violent, dangerous and squalid. So of course they are a problem. But the real problem is not prisons but imprisonment, one endpoint in the criminal justice system. Prisons have no control over their own business. They simply have to do what they can with what the courts send them, and the courts send them what sentencing policy requires. Brave new thinking is needed. What is imprisonment supposed to achieve? If we know, are there better ways of achieving it? If sentences are needed, how long should they be? Liz Truss’s only response so far has been to recruit more prison officers, but doing that (even if she can) will address none of the confusions around imprisonment. Michael Sheldon Norwich • Our prisons are full and the prospect of recruiting enough staff to properly look after prisoners is months, if not years, away. So we need to reduce the numbers in prison in England and Wales. Scotland has already succeeded in reducing numbers, but it needs political will. One issue to address is ever-longer prison sentences – in England and Wales we have fewer people going to prison, but their prison sentences are longer than 10 years ago for the same crimes. Yet there is no evidence that these longer sentences are either more effective or a deterrent. The reasons for sentence inflation are complex, but sentencing guidelines, the decline of sentence appeals and punitive rhetoric may all be to blame. The government could take action on all these without endangering public safety in any way. Penelope Gibbs Director, Transform Justice • The Guardian was strangely muted at the time Chris Grayling was pushing through the privatisation of the probation service, as if you too were convinced it was failing and indifferent to its fate as a respected and necessary public body. It is good to see you acknowledge that this was a foreseeable catastrophe (Editorial, 16 November). The service was not failing, and many of the problems it had were the consequence of sustained government mismanagement and misguided target-setting, rather than internal incompetence. There is a clear evidence base for doing probation well, and there were, back in 2014, a cohort of managers and officers perfectly capable of delivering this, although many have now left their broken and demoralised profession. The community rehabilitation companies that took over the probation trusts have been short-changed, literally, by Grayling, who brazenly overestimated the numbers they would get to supervise in order to attract their business. “Payment by results” is a fiasco, and the companies cannot afford to keep their third-sector partners on board. They are not coming clean about all that is going wrong, some may break their contracts, and the Ministry of Justice is doing its level best to silence critics. Could the Guardian now throw the weight of its investigative resources into exposing this catastrophe in full? Public safety has been jeopardised by it, but beyond the specifics of that, exposure would reveal – all cost-efficiency rhetoric apart – how cynical the motives and wasteful the methods of privatisation actually are. Mike Nellis Emeritus professor of criminal and community justice, University of Strathclyde • Your otherwise excellent editorial outlining the disastrous consequences for offender rehabilitation of Chris Grayling’s political decision-making for ideological purposes falls into the trap of suggesting that probation was widely considered to be failing in 2012. This is not true, as the Ministry of Justice’s own 2013 report highlighted that the performance of the then 35 probation trusts was either good or excellent against the national target framework. Indeed, many trusts had also received national and international recognition for their business excellence. The truth is that from the creation of a National Probation Service in 2001, which retained its strong local accountability through local boards and then trusts, Labour and then the coalition administration were concerned with central control and the move to privatisation. As early as 2003, the Carter report recommended the segmentation of service delivery so that privatisation and central control of what remained could be facilitated. It is Labour’s 2007 Offender Management Act that has provided the basis for the folly of the Tories’ Transforming Rehabilitation. Every single home secretary and justice secretary since 2001 has taken the opportunity to attack probation, whether it was John Reid describing it as not fit for purpose or Ken Clarke suggesting that the 2011 riots were the consequences of failed offender rehabilitation. The real issue is not one of supposed failure but why a public service with a proud 107-year history, respected and emulated across Europe and beyond, has been regularly attacked. I can only conclude that decency, compassion and humanity towards those who commit crimes and the belief that with sustained assistance people can turn their lives round is now too old-fashioned and stands in the way of profits for global businesses. Steve Collett Chief probation officer, Cheshire area 2001-10 • While I agreed with the majority of your editorial, it was, like the Grayling agenda which it criticised, based upon a false premise. It stated that “in 2012 the probation service was widely considered to be failing. Few questioned the need for reform”. This is completely incorrect on both points: firstly the majority of probation trusts in England and Wales had been performing extremely well, indeed had achieved standards of excellence at that time, and secondly there were large numbers of people and organisations, the majority experts in the field, questioning the need for the so-called Transforming Rehabilitation agenda, which Grayling bulldozed through without any evidence base. Community sentences managed by probation services had achieved a lower conviction rate than custodial sentences. It was the short-term prison sentences which resulted in the highest reconviction rate, and at the time of Grayling’s intervention probation services had no remit, except in the 18-21 age group, to manage these on release. Grayling spoke of a “revolving door” of custody and destroyed probation for not reducing reoffending in a group that they were not tasked to work with. Probation services were carved up by Grayling and a large section sold off to private companies. He and his team also had no understanding of the dynamic nature of risk, and those assessed as low and medium risk of causing harm are placed with the private companies, and high risk with the civil service section of probation. Statistics show that the majority of serious further offences come from the low- to medium-risk groups, and serious case reviews have counselled against increasing the number of agencies involved with risky individuals and the communication problems caused. Several private companies have disposed of professionally trained staff, seeing them as too expensive. Having worked as a probation officer from 1981 to 2014, I have been heartbroken to see the shambles that the world of probation has now become. Most of my contemporaries have now also left their jobs as workloads have increasingly become untenable. Younger colleagues have either left to work in new fields or are currently struggling on in very difficult circumstances. Workloads across the board have now become unmanageable. This is both due to high numbers and the nature of the caseloads, coupled with convoluted systems of communication between public and private sector. Grayling has destroyed a high-performing service and a profession. The revolving door he spoke of between short-term prison sentences and reoffending just got faster.

{ "title":"Fears after government abolishes civil service's child poverty unit", "content": "Ministers have abolished the civil service’s once high-profile child poverty unit, prompting warnings from MPs and charities that political focus on the issue has been abandoned by Theresa May. Christmas at a food bank: ‘They’ve not eaten for three days’ | Frances Ryan Read more The admission came in answers to parliamentary questions, which revealed that the team set up under Tony Blair’s government has been subsumed into the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP), after seeing its staffing halved in three years. Dan Jarvis, the Labour MP whose questioning uncovered the closure, said the decision ran contrary to the May’s pledge to govern on the basis of social justice and equal life chances. “When the prime minister stood on the steps of Downing Street, she promised to fight the burning injustice of being born poor and lead a government that worked for everyone,” he said. “Having a country that works for everyone requires a government prepared to both help those who fall behind and stop people being disadvantaged from the outset. Theresa May has no unit, no target and no intention of eliminating child poverty.” There were 3.9 million children living in poverty in the UK in 2014-15, according to DWP figures quoted by the Child Poverty Action Group, amounting to 28% of all children in the UK. The child poverty unit was jointly run by the DWP, the Department for Education (DfE) and the Treasury and was formerly one of the government’s most high profile organisations devoted to improving social mobility. It was set up in 1999 under Blair’s government, part of a much-touted ambition to eliminate childhood poverty within two decades. That target was dropped earlier this year amid a restructuring of goals around a wider measure of life chances, also taking in issues such as debt and addiction. Charities dealing with child poverty described the news as alarming and likely to mean child poverty becoming less of a priority for May’s government. Alison Garnham, chief executive of the Child Poverty Action Group, said the structure of the child poverty unit had meant the subject was considered across government. “A move to restrict the unit to just one department would be worrying and could potentially downgrade the unit’s status and weaken its reach, influence and effectiveness right across government,” she said. The Institute for Fiscal Studies was projecting a 50% increase in child poverty by 2020, rather than its elimination, Garnham said, adding: “The threat level has escalated. We should be adding to our resources for getting children out of poverty, not diminishing them.” However, a DWP spokeswoman said it was “nonsense” to suggest that the end of the standalone child poverty unit meant the government was not committed to its work. She said: “We are absolutely committed to tackling poverty and in the new year we will publish a social justice paper outlining our plans for the years ahead. “Work is the best way out of poverty and there are record levels of low unemployment. By increasing the national living wage and taking millions of people out of paying any income tax, we are ensuring it always pays to be in work.” In 2013, the child poverty unit had just over 23 full time-equivalent staff members, which had fallen to 10.5 for 2015-16, an earlier ministerial statement had revealed. All the work of the unit has now been transferred into the DWP, according to junior minister Damian Hinds, who responded to Jarvis’s question. Child poverty had also been dealt with by the Social Mobility and Child Poverty Commission, but the child poverty aspect of its remit was removed earlier this year when it was restructured as the Social Mobility Commission. The commission itself has fewer civil service staff than it does commissioners, according to an answer to another parliamentary question from Jarvis. According to the DfE, it is limited to seven staff but has eight commissioners. It has also emerged that the DWP is to permanently abandon its much-delayed life chances strategy, one of David Cameron’s stated flagship policies for his planned last term as prime minister, which was originally scheduled to be launched in June. It was reported last month that this was being dropped in favour of a wider scheme on social justice, intended to focus not just on the very poor but also May’s favoured demographic of the “just about managing” households. In response to another question from Jarvis, who has introduced a private member’s bill to put in place a new target for reducing childhood poverty, the DWP confirmed that the life chances strategy was being replaced by a green paper on social justice in the New Year. Jarvis is leading a debate on child poverty in the House of Commons on Tuesday.",diasaster:0},

A massive security presence, the suspension of the internet and a wave of arrests appeared to have largely stifled expected opposition protests on Monday against the continuing rule of Kabila. With less than 12 hours before Kabila’s mandate expired at midnight – launching the vast resource-rich central African state into the political unknown – there were only scattered clashes and standoffs between security forces and opposition protesters in the capital, Kinshasa. Has Africa had its fill of ‘strongmen’? Read more Opposition leaders have repeatedly promised to launch a wave of civil protest on Monday to force Kabila, who took power in 2001 and has won two elections, to step down and most observers expected widespread violence. The constitution does not allow a third term. Katumbi, the former governor of the southern province of Katanga, called on Kabila to step down before he became “an illegitimate” ruler. “[He] does not want the elections so I am advising him it is still possible to leave a legacy. It is very important … At midnight on [Monday] he will no longer be a legitimate president,” Katumbi told the Guardian in a telephone interview. Katumbi has been in exile since being convicted on a minor charge of fraud, which supporters say was politically motivated. He said he has no immediate intention of returning to DRC. “If I want to go back I can go today or tomorrow but I am a man of peace. I do not want my people to die. We want peace to be our priority. [Kabila] can shoot me, jail me, kill me and create more chaos. I don’t want that. I want a peaceful transfer of power,” said Katumbi, who has spent recent weeks traveling between western capitals to rally support.

Photograph: John Bompengo/AP Critics accuse Kabila of seeking to hold on to power indefinitely, and promised a “trial of strength on the streets” in coming days.

Valentin Mubake, chief political adviser to veteran opposition leader Étienne Tshisekedi, said the absence of violence was “the calm before the storm”. 'I only dream of bicycles': the DRC cycling club offering hope (and breakfast) Read more Supporters and ministers say Kabila, 45, has no intention of clinging to office and have promise elections would be held as soon as practically possible. They dismiss the opposition as troublemakers who do not reflect the will of the country’s 70 million inhabitants. Barnabé Kikaya, a key diplomatic aide of Kabila, told reporters in Kinshasa that the government of the DRC was “committed to ensuring peace, order and the respect of law” at this “challenging moment”. “President Joseph Kabila will remain in office [on Tuesday] and until we are able to hold free and fair elections ... The demand that President Kabila abandons his responsibilities ... at midnight tonight is not serious. The constitution states that he will remain president until his successor is elected,” Kikaya said. Observers fear the crisis could plunge DRC, which has never known a peaceful transfer of power since gaining independence from Belgium in 1960, into a prolonged period of damaging, and possibly very violent, instability. Such concerns will be reinforced by reports of renewed fighting in eastern DRC on Monday linked to the political crisis. A newly emerged armed group broadly connected to the opposition launched assaults overnight on government troops’ positions in North Kivu, according to humanitarian officials. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Police have been out in force in Kinshasa and elsewhere in DRC. Photograph: John Bompengo/AP Over the weekend tens of thousands of armed police and paramilitaries were deployed on to streets across the country, while armoured vehicles protected at strategic points in key towns and cities. In September more than 60 people died when security forces opened fire on an opposition march. “Today there were lots of police everywhere so we did not go into the streets. But we will tomorrow,” said one opposition activist in Bunia, a city near the Ugandan border. In Kinshasa almost all shops and businesses were shut and streets were largely deserted. There were unconfirmed reports of scores of detentions. Organisations such as Lucha and Filimbi favoured by young, educated opposition activists appear to have been particularly targeted. Gloria Sengha, a prominent member of Lucha, has been missing for the past three days, friends and family told local media. The 23-year-old lawyer was last seen in Kinshasa, Her current whereabouts were unknown, they said. Human Rights Watch, the campaign group, said it had received credible reports of at least 42 people arrested in Goma, the eastern city, on Monday morning. The opposition has been hobbled by a lack of unity and by successive crackdowns, with demonstrations banned for several months. Meanwhile negotiations have intensified as the end of Kabila’s mandate has approached. Washington and European capitals have sought to pressure him into holding elections. Last-minute talks brokered by the Catholic church between DRC government representatives and a coalition of opposition groups failed to reach agreement on Saturday, but are scheduled to start again on Wednesday after Congolese bishops return form a visit to Rome where they will see Pope Francis. Government officials blame the opposition for the lack of progress in reaching a settlement and accuse western powers, which have tried to pressure Kabila to make concessions by imposing sanctions on key members of his entourage, of “a neo-colonial mindset”. “The US and the Europeans shouldn’t try and force us. It’s a pretty clumsy approach to take. It is lucky that the president is a very calm man,” said Lambert Mende, minister of information and a close confidante of Kabila. But there is little doubt there is widespread popular discontent over Kabila’s rule. Facebook Twitter Pinterest An opposition supporter displays a red card against Joseph Kabila’s rule. Photograph: Thomas Mukoya/Reuters On Monday, a crowd gathered by the roadside near the University of Kinshasa, waving red cards – mimicking football referees – and shouting anti-Kabila slogans. “He must go. We are all suffering too much. There is too much pain from him for us. The government are thieves,” said Olivier, a 28-year-old unemployed law graduate. At the university hundreds of students faced off with riot police who forced journalists away from the scene. Elsewhere in the capital there were reports of stones being thrown at security forces and public buses. Countrywide protests are scheduled for Tuesday, however, raising the prospect of further unrest later in the week. High inflation, the devaluation of local currency and flagging investment is causing deep economic hardship throughout DRC, where two-thirds of population live on less than £1.50 a day. Many observers believe Katumbi, who also owns one of Africa’s most successful football clubs, could unify the fragmented opposition and present a more credible alternative to Kabila than Tshisekedi, a 84-year-old former prime minister. In 2006, Kabila oversaw the first free vote in DRC in decades, ushering in a period of relative stability and economic growth as mining firms invested billions of dollars. But many observers now fear a return to the brutal civil wars in which an estimated 5 million people were killed between 1997, when the dictator Mobutu Sese Seko was ousted after a 32-year rule, and 2003. “It is the balance of power on the ground which counts … The balance of power will now be worked out on the streets and then we will talk again. But in the long run, whether its around a table or in the streets, Kabila will lose,” said Mubake, Tshisekedi’s adviser.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Take back control – the slogan the left should make its own", "content": "The slogan of the year, and perhaps the century, is the one about the need to “take back control”. Those intoxicating words took centre stage in the EU referendum and won the vote for the Brexiteers. Donald Trump noted the potency of the slogan and made it a central theme of his victorious campaign. This is a slogan that triggers tumultuous change. But it does so with little or no scrutiny. One of the oddities about vote-winning slogans is that they become so familiar there is little curiosity as to precise meaning. Repetition is an alternative to clarity. In this case, the ubiquitous words are much more interesting than they seem. What form will “control” take? Who or what will be the mediating agencies? Presumably the advocates in the UK do not mean they want a private company to “take back control”. They are not calling for the likes of Southern trains to have more control over our lives. Instead the users of the slogan can only mean it is time for government or the state to take back control. Their focus produces a bizarre contortion. Thatcherite free marketeers in the UK and anti-government Tea Partyites in the US dance to statist tunes. During the UK referendum Michael Gove argued with his usual clarity that leaving the EU would enable government to intervene more to protect industries threatened by global competition. All the leading Brexiteers called for state intervention in the labour market. In a later rally with his friend Donald Trump, Nigel Farage pledged, to ecstatic cheers, that they would take on the banks and the multinationals. Farage sounded like Bernie Sanders. Trump is the most statist US president-elect for decades. His economic policies make Ed Balls’ fiscal stimulus, proposed long before he became a famous dancer, seem ridiculously tame. In particular Trump won the election by proposing to borrow billions for capital investment projects. He did not talk about the state. Instead he would build roads, railways and the rest. He had personified the state. The shift in the framing of the debate about the role of government is seismic. During the Thatcher/Reagan/Blair/Cameron era, the overwhelming pitch was also about “control”, but it took a different form. Then, “control” was supposed to be about the empowerment of the individual. Yet individuals have never felt less empowered, hence the power of this year’s vote-winning slogan. In Britain patients were promised “choice” in a more market-based NHS, and parents were promised the power to choose a school of their choice. Try telling a patient they are empowered as they struggle to see a GP and fail powerlessly to navigate their way around a chaotic NHS. Schools are similarly fractured. There is a growing teacher recruitment crisis, and in some cases head teachers assume responsibilities when they are not remotely experienced enough. Choosing a school where the head is in their early 30s and with staff leaving in droves is not a form of empowerment for parents. Nor do commuters in the south of England feel empowered by the fractured railway system where so many agencies are involved no one is responsible. The rail strikes and other forms of industrial action are unforgivably ruthless, but they do not erupt in a vacuum. They happen when there is no clear leadership and sense of direction. Who is in control? The train companies, Network Rail, the regulators, the transport secretary? The answer is all of these agencies and therefore none of them. The entire service is a shambles, uniting the CBI, passengers needing to get to work, and any sane person in their despair. There is no control. What should Jeremy Corbyn’s brand of leftwing populism look like? | Yanis Varoufakis and others Read more Chaos too can be seen in the NHS. A senior health official told me recently that in his area there are seven inefficient agencies supposedly responsible for health provision. It is not clear which of them has overall responsibility. He had been a strong supporter of the market-based reforms until he discovered that the NHS as constituted was not a market and the only way one agency could improve was to undermine one of the others. The official is now a convert to clear lines of control from the top down with prominent individuals held to account. The slogan about “control” should be one that marks a move to the left. It is the left that on the whole believes markets should be regulated and the state can be a benevolent mediator – an instrument that can empower rather than stifle individuals. But across much of the democratic world the left is as fractured as the providers of public services in the UK. Its leaders lack the ability to communicate and use language as weapon. It is split between those who believe with a shallow intensity there is no left/right divide any more and those who do but are not sure how to pitch an argument. The vacuum matters because the slogan of the year could move in two very different directions. The words might propel us towards an ugly debate about kicking out foreigners; alternatively they could begin a constructive debate in which we seek to answer what forms a modern, efficient accountable government should take in order to give voters a sense of control. So far in the UK it is Theresa May who is moving gingerly on to fertile terrain. When she noted at her party conference that it was time to recognise the good that governments can do, her words marked the end of one era and a stumbling towards the next.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Christine Lagarde avoids jail, keeps job after guilty verdict in negligence trial", "content": "Christine Lagarde has been found guilty of negligence in approving a massive payout of taxpayers’ money to controversial French businessman Bernard Tapie but avoided a jail sentence. A French court convicted the head of the International Monetary Fund and former government minister, who had faced a €15,000 (£12,600) fine and up to a year in prison. But it decided she should not be punished and that the conviction would not constitute a criminal record. On Monday evening the IMF gave her its full support. The verdict came as a surprise as even the public prosecutor had admitted the evidence against Lagarde was “weak” during a five-day trial last week. Jean-Claude Marin told the court Lagarde’s actions fell into the category of politics and not criminality and called for her to be acquitted. Lagarde, who has always argued she did nothing wrong and acted “in the public interest”, was not present for the judgment. Her lawyer Patrick Maisonneuve said she had flown back to Washington DC, where the IMF is based. Within hours of the court’s decision, the IMF’s 24-member board convened a meeting to discuss Lagarde’s future. On Monday evening the IMF’s Washington-based executive board gave Lagarde its full support. “The executive board looks forward to continuing to work with the managing director to address the difficult challenges facing the global economy,” the board said in a statement. The IMF’s shareholders were aware of the pending court proceedings when they appointed Lagarde to a second five-year term earlier this year and were weighing up whether she – and the IMF – had suffered lasting reputational damage. The decision not to impose any penalty despite the guilty verdict was seen by some observers as enhancing the chances of the IMF’s managing director holding on to her job. Support for Lagarde came from the former US Treasury secretary, Larry Summers, who said it was a “sorry day for French justice”. Lagarde was the “best thing” to happen to the IMF in a long time, Summers added. Lagarde had appeared before the Cour de Justice de la République, a special tribunal set up to judge ministers and public officials for alleged crimes committed while in office. It is made up of three professional judges and 12 politicians from the French houses of parliament. It was only the fifth time the court had sat and its judgments cannot be appealed against. Lagarde’s lawyer Patrick Maisonneuve told journalists after the judgment: “We would have preferred an acquittal, but it should be remembered that the court has not imposed any sentence whatsoever.” The Tapie case has rumbled on since 1993 when the businessman sold his majority share in the sportswear company Adidas to Crédit Lyonnais, a bank then part-owned by the French state, to avoid a conflict of interest when he took up a government post. Tapie accused the bank, which later sold the shares at a higher price, of defrauding him by undervaluing his investment. Lagarde was the finance minister under Nicolas Sarkozy between 2007 and 2011, when she became head of the IMF – replacing her disgraced compatriot Dominique Strauss-Kahn, who had been put on trial for attacking a New York hotel maid. She referred the case to a private arbitration panel, which awarded Tapie more than €400m. She was accused of “negligence with public money” for having paid up and not contested the award, which experts had advised against. She denied any wrongdoing and claimed she had not seen all documents suggesting the payout should not be made. Six others, including her former chief of staff Stéphane Richard, now head of telecoms giant Orange, are being investigated for fraud. All have denied acting illegally. Tapie has since been ordered to pay back the €400m but is appealing against the decision. Detectives have spent years trying to establish if the award was given to Tapie under Sarkozy’s orders in return for the businessman’s support in his successful 2007 presidential campaign. The IMF has 24 voting board members who represent 189 countries. It recently voted to give her a second term. Lagarde won the first time despite widespread criticism that the organisation has failed to appoint a non-European leader in its 72-year history. Lagarde had the backing of then US Treasury secretary Tim Geithner whose support denied the job to Agustín Carstens, current governor of the Bank of Mexico, who will be a strong candidate to replace Lagarde if she is made to go. Carstens is set to become general manager at the International Bank of Settlements in Basel, Switzerland next year.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"101-year-old paedophile jailed for 13 years", "content": "A 101-year-old man has been jailed for 13 years for a string of sex offences against young children in the 1970s and 80s. Ralph Clarke, a retired haulier, is thought to be the oldest defendant ever convicted in Britain. Following a two-week trial at Birmingham crown court, a jury on Friday found the ex RAF-serviceman guilty of 17 offences of indecent assault, 11 of indecency with a child and two attempted serious sexual assaults. Clarke, from Erdington, Birmingham, pleaded guilty to nine offences relating to a male victim partway through the trial, but he denied a further 21 counts of indecent assault and indecency against two girls. During the sentencing on Monday, the judge, Richard Bond QC, told him: “You present as a fragile old man, however, what was plain to see was that, despite your guilty pleas, you have no remorse whatsoever.” The great-grandfather had told the court he was “pretty well immune” to feelings when asked about the charges. Due to his age, special provisions were made for Clarke during his trial. The court only sat between 9.30am and 1.30pm, so that the defendant could go home and rest, and he was allowed to sit at the back of the court room instead of in the dock. Bond told the jury that, due to Clarke’s poor hearing, he would be speaking loudly with his intermediary during the trial. “I invite, in fact I direct you, to ignore any such communications between Mr Clarke and the intermediary or with his barrister,” he said. “The reason for that is that those communications are normally private but you are bound to hear them in this case for obvious reasons.” Clarke’s victims, now all in their forties, came forward to the police after they saw his 100th birthday being celebrated by people on Facebook. All reported being abused in a workshop and the cab of his delivery lorry between 1974 and 1983. Clarke, born in March 1915, replaces Gaston Pinsard as Britain’s oldest convicted paedophile. Pinsard was jailed for 18 months in 2015 for indecent assaults against young girls in the 50s and 60s. DC Emma Fennon, of West Midlands police, described Clarke as “a hard man who had no feelings”. “He’s never once said sorry,” she said. “I’ve never in all of my service met anybody who has affected me like Mr Clarke has. The very way that he speaks about the offences. His lack of care. He doesn’t feel that he’s done anything wrong.” The judge told the court that the passage of time did not mean abusers would escape justice and that it was unlikely Clarke would ever be released. “Those who were sexually abused even in the distant past can rest assured that any complaint will be treated with sympathy and compassion,” he said. The Crown Prosecution Service said that while Clarke’s age and health were considered, the serious nature of his offences meant a prosecution was in the public interest. A spokesman said: “Ralph Clarke used fear and intimidation to control the victims and sexually abuse them.”",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"US travel ban leaves Iranian LGBT refugees in limbo", "content": "Gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender refugees from Iran have found themselves caught between a rock and a hard place after Donald Trump’s executive order banning entry for people from seven Muslim-majority countries. US travel ban puts 20,000 refugees in 'precarious circumstances', UN says Read more The order also suspended the US refugee admissions system for 120 days, and promised to prioritise members of religious minorities. But it made no mention of people facing persecution for their sexual orientation, and several gay Iranians who have fled a country where homosexuality is punishable by death are now left stuck in Turkey, where they say they are experiencing worse homophobic abuses than in their homeland. Some of the refugees have already had their asylum applications approved by the UN refugee agency and were due to be resettled in the US after months or even years of interviews and security checks. Mitra, a 27-year-old lesbian living in Denizli, a conservative city in south-west Turkey, left Iran in 2014 after receiving death threats because of her activities as the editor of Aghaliat, an online magazine focusing on LGBT issues. She was granted refugee status by the UN nearly two years ago, and was due to attend her final interview this month before being resettled in the US. “They have just called me and said it’s all cancelled,” she said. Until Trump’s ban came into force, the US was the only viable path to safety for gay Iranians who end up in Turkey. Canada no longer accepts them because it is focusing on Syrian refugees. European countries do not normally accept LGBT Iranians who have applied from Turkey. Like many of her fellow minorities, Mitra was initially approved to go to Canada. “I waited for 14 months, [and] even went through the medical checks but one day they called and said Canada doesn’t accept Iranians anymore and I should go to the US. Now that’s up in the air too.” Mitra added: “One by one all my dreams and hopes are being destroyed before my eyes. It doesn’t matter to me whether to go to Canada or the US, I just want to go somewhere – anywhere – safe.” Mitra currently lives with her partner in a tiny room with one sofa that is also their bed. “Iran doesn’t want us, Canada doesn’t want us and now the US doesn’t want us either. I have seen the suicide of three friends since 2015. A gay Iranian [threw] himself off a balcony and an Iranian lesbian hanged herself just eight months ago.” She argued that the US should also make exemptions for sexual minorities as well. “At least with religious refugees, they have the support of their families, we don’t even have that. Our families are [ashamed] of us.” Javad, 50, is a disabled Iranian gay man also living in Turkey. “I was abandoned by my family, I was abandoned by my country and now I [do not] have anywhere to go,” he said. He said two of his friends were beaten up in the street. “One day a friend of mine, an Iranian gay name Pouya, called and said, ‘forgive me’,” he said. “I realised he was about to take his life. “I am disabled, I struggled to get to his house, by the time I got there he had died. He had just had enough.” Saghi Ghahraman, the head of the Canada-based Iranian Queer Organisation, said LGBT Iranians face horrific punishment and bullying. A fatwa issued in 1987 by the late Ayatollah Khomeini legalised transexuality, but social stigma remains still rampant, and homosexuality is still punishable by death. “Up until 2013, the wait-time for the LGBT to be determined and resettled by the [UN high commissioner for refugees] in Turkey was about a year and a half, which was barely manageable,” she said. “But it changed with the war in Syria, and when the USA and Canada undertook resettlement of large number of displaced Syrians, the LGBT wait-time before resettlement went up to three years,” she said. Meanwhile, gay Iranian exiles have been subjected to a string of violent hate attacks and murders in Turkey, said Ghahraman. The 26-year-old Azad, a gay Iranian who was approved for relocation by the UN 23 months ago, said his friend fainted in the bus when he heard about Trump’s decision. “We’re stuck, we can’t go forward, we can’t go backward,” he said. “Turkey is so unstable too these days and anything can happen, what if they deport us back to Iran?”",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"UK house price growth has hit 14-month low, says Nationwide", "content": "UK house prices grew at their weakest annual rate in more than a year in January, in an early sign of the property market slowdown predicted for 2017. Annual growth edged down from 4.5% in December to 4.3%, according to the mortgage lender Nationwide. It was the weakest since November 2015. On a monthly basis, the average price of a UK home edged up 0.2%, to £205,240, following a 0.8% rise in December. Robert Gardner, Nationwide’s chief economist, said there were indications the housing market would soften in 2017, as household budgets come under pressure from higher consumer inflation at a time of weaker jobs and wage growth. UK housing market falters as estate agents become less optimistic Read more “The outlook for the housing market remains clouded, reflecting the uncertainty surrounding economic prospects more broadly,” Gardner said. “On the one hand, there are grounds for optimism. The economy has remained far stronger than expected in the wake of the Brexit vote. However, there are tentative signs that conditions may be about to soften. “The economy is likely to slow through 2017 as the squeeze on household budgets intensifies and heightened uncertainty weighs on business investment and hiring.” Nationwide predicts that growth in house prices will more than halve in 2017 to 2% from 4.5% in 2016. Howard Archer, the chief UK economist at IHS Markit, said conditions for house buyers were likely to deteriorate progressively during 2017. Inflation has already started to rise as the impact of the sharp fall in the value of the pound since the EU referendum feeds through to prices. A weaker pound makes imports from abroad more expensive. The headline rate UK inflation jumped to a two-and-a-half-year high of 1.6% in December from 1.2% in November, and is expected to rise to about 3% in the coming months. Looking back at trends over the last 60 years, Nationwide said the biggest gains in real house prices – comparing how much faster house prices have increased compared with goods and services more generally – were made in the 2000s. “These increases were spurred by a combination of strong and stable economic growth, a structural decline in interest rates and the further liberalisation of the financial system,” Gardner said. “In the decades ahead, real house price trends will continue to depend crucially on developments in the wider economy, though there is an even greater degree of uncertainty around this than usual.”",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Protesters in Romania denounce plan to decriminalise misconduct offences", "content": "Tens of thousands of people have taken to the streets in Romania to protest against an emergency ordinance passed on Tuesday night that decriminalises some offences, including official misconduct in cases where the financial damage is less than 200,000 lei (£38,000). Critics of the ordinance, introduced by a government that won parliamentary elections in December, say it could reverse an anti-corruption fight in Romania that has drawn widespread praise internationally. Additional laws could be issued in the coming days, further eroding ministers’ accountability, according to the government’s opponents. In a post on Facebook, the Romanian president, Klaus Iohannis, who has opposed the emergency ordinance and who last month joined protesters on the streets, wrote: “Today is a day of mourning for the rule of law.” News of the ordinance passing broke at about 10pm local time, and by midnight local media estimated that 12,000 people were demonstrating in Bucharest and 10,000 in other cities across the country, despite freezing temperatures. There were shouts of “Thieves” and “You won’t get away with it.” “I don’t normally protest but I just felt such a sense of rage,” said Alexandra Boeriu, a 35-year-old NGO worker who protested outside the main government building in Bucharest. “I was young, but I did live through communism and I know what this is. I don’t want this for my kids. There are a lot of people protesting who want to have a future in this country. It feels like someone has died.” Facebook Twitter Pinterest Klaus Iohannis: ‘Today is a day of mourning for the rule of law.’ Photograph: Patrick Seeger/EPA “You can’t just publish laws in the night and say shut up, we won the election, you have no rights,” said Dragos Stanca, 42, a digital media entrepreneur who was also demonstrating. “It’s a very dangerous precedent. If this is the kind of procedure they do, we wonder what’s next. It looks like anything is possible.” Protests have been held for the past two Sundays over the government’s plans, which would also grant amnesty to those sentenced to jail terms shorter than five years in relation to certain crimes and halve prison terms for those with young children, pregnant women, or those over 60. The EU has weighed in on the controversy, warning the government not to backtrack on anti-graft measures. “The fight against corruption needs to be advanced, not undone,” European commission head Jean-Claude Juncker and his deputy, Frans Timmermans, said in a joint statement. “We are following the latest developments in Romania with great concern.” Government officials have suggested the laws were aimed at easing overcrowded conditions in prisons, but few observers are convinced, and many believe the real purpose is to help convicted politicians, or those who are now under investigation, escape justice. Romania, an enthusiastic EU member for a decade and a major recipient of EU funds, remains one of Europe’s most corrupt countries: a report by the IPP thinktank released late last year found that of the 588 MPs elected in previous elections in 2012, 89 – or 15% – were either under investigation for graft, had already been convicted, or chose to step down for other positions. Hundreds of officials have been imprisoned in recent years, and more than 2,000 files are under investigation in relation to abuse of office, according to prosecutors. “With this government I feel insecure and the new law which favours corruption is a huge offence and an attack on us, the regular people,” said Alberto Grosescu, a 29-year-old photographer who took to the streets on Tuesday night immediately after the ordinance was announced. Grosescu predicts that many more people will come out to protest. “I’m pretty sure that tonight there is going to be over 100,000 people in Bucharest, maybe over 200,000 across the whole country,” he said. Those protesting hope that their actions could still lead to change. “They have to, I don’t think politicians can ignore so many people, but we have to stand up and continue to stand up,” said Boeriu. Thousands of people gathered outside the main government building in Bucharest on Wednesday morning. It is thought that protests later in the day could be the biggest since the fall of communism in 1989.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Who is Neil Gorsuch? A staunch conservative with a background to worry liberals", "content": "In a 2005 essay titled Liberals ’N’ Lawsuits, Neil Gorsuch, then a corporate lawyer in Washington, DC, argued that “American liberals” had come to rely too much on court decisions to advance “their social agenda on everything from gay marriage to assisted suicide to the use of vouchers for private-school education”. Published just months after the re-election of George W Bush, it was a remarkable bit of concern-trolling ahead of its time. If liberals really wanted to enact their agenda, Gorsuch wrote, they should focus on “trying to win elections rather than lawsuits”. Neil Gorsuch nominated by Trump to fill supreme court vacancy Read more Fast-forward 12 years. American liberals – and quite a few centrists too – have lost another election and many have once again turned their eyes to the courts, hoping for protection from what looks to many of them like a vicious attack by the executive branch on core rights and freedoms. If Donald Trump has his way Gorsuch will be in a position this time to do more than just write an essay. If confirmed by the Senate as the newest justice on the US supreme court, he will have unique power to help vindicate or frustrate liberals’ strategy. The announcement of Gorsuch’s nomination in a hyped White House spectacle on Tuesday night was greeted with expressions of concern on the left and robust cheer on the right. Carrie Severino, chief counsel of the conservative Judicial Crisis Network, hailed Gorsuch as a “principled constitutionalist” with “an obviously brilliant legal mind”. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Trump picks Neil Gorsuch for US supreme court “He is someone who is going to look at any question according to what the constitution itself says, setting aside his own political views” whatever they may be, Severino said. A partisan scrum has developed around the nomination nevertheless, with Democrats vowing a filibuster and the Republican senate leadership vowing a confirmation. The air of partisan controversy is not obviously rooted in Gorsuch’s track record as a circuit court judge, which does not include rulings on the kinds of hot-button social issues he alluded to in his Bush-era essay. Gorsuch’s disposition on abortion rights cases may be suggested in a line from a book he wrote about euthanasia, the subject of his doctoral studies at Oxford University. “To act intentionally against life is to suggest that its value rests only on its transient instrumental usefulness for other ends,” Gorsuch wrote. Nancy Northup, president and CEO of the Center for Reproductive Rights, said the onus was on the nominee to explain his position on the issue. “Given president Trump’s promise to appoint a supreme court justice that would seek to overturn Roe v Wade, we need to know whether Judge Gorsuch would do just that,” Northup said. The looming issues awaiting Donald Trump's supreme court nominee Read more “Our constitution guarantees a woman’s right to safe, legal abortion. Any effort to gut those protections would harm the rights and health of women for generations to come.” But beyond any single issue Gorsuch has articulated a judicial philosophy that emphasizes the primacy of the constitution and prizes the text of laws, while warning against judicial forays that might be mistaken for an attempt to shape or direct legislation. “Congress could have written the law differently than it did, and it is always free to rewrite the law when it wishes,” Gorsuch wrote in a ruling that argued for a new hearing for a felon convicted of firearm possession. “But in our legal order it is the role of the courts to apply the law as it is written, not some different law Congress might have written in the past or might write in the future.” In some ways Gorsuch seems likely to please social conservatives. He has repeatedly upheld claims of a religious exemption where the law would compel an individual to violate a personal spiritual belief. While the supreme court declined to consider one such “religious liberty” case in 2016, in which a family-owned pharmacy objected to a state regulation forcing it to sell emergency contraceptives, future cases in the area seem likely. In Hobby Lobby Stores Inc v Sebelius, Gorsuch argued that a retail store owner need not comply with a provision in Barack Obama’s health care law requiring employers to provide health insurance covering oral contraceptives. In his opinion Gorsuch gave wide berth to the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which asserts the religious liberty claim and which Gorsuch called a “super-statute”. Hannah Smith, a lawyer at the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, which represented Hobby Lobby in the case, praised the judge’s ruling. “That opinion is an example that he is a clear thinker, a clear writer on really complicated religious liberty issues,” Smith told the Guardian. “They were faced with a Hobson’s choice, to choose to abide by their religion or saving their business. I think he’s someone who would stand up for the religious liberty for all.” Elsewhere Gorsuch has ruled sympathetically in cases involving the erection of Ten Commandments monuments in public spaces and ruled against capital punishment defendants seeking relief from their sentences. In the integrity of his adherence to the principal of judicial restraint, as well as in the pithy eloquence – if he lacks a certain acerbity – of his opinions, Gorsuch is often compared favorably with the justice he would replace, Antonin Scalia, who died in February 2016. “His writing style has often been compared to Justice Scalia’s,” Severino said. “It’s very incisive, very clear and logical, but also very entertaining, and of course that was a hallmark of Justice Scalia’s own writing style.” Gorsuch spoke about Scalia’s death in an April 2016 speech at Case Western University. “I was taking a breather in the middle of a ski run with little on my mind but the next mogul field when my phone rang with the news,” Gorsuch said. “I immediately lost what breath I had left, and I am not embarrassed to admit that I couldn’t see the rest of the way down the mountain for the tears. He really was a lion of the law: docile in private life but a ferocious fighter when at work, with a roar that could echo for miles.” Gorsuch’s biggest difference with Scalia comes in the field of administrative law, an area that is sleepy for most laypeople but determines the scope of much government action. The Trump nominee has been a critic of “Chevron deference,” a doctrine that gives administrative agencies significant latitude with how they interpret federal statutes. His views, which are shared by a number of conservative legal scholars, would significantly weaken the federal government and allow the courts to override agency actions on issues ranging from immigration to health care to the environment. But several former colleagues of Gorsuch’s from across the ideological spectrum have called for Gorsuch’s confirmation, saying his temperament is distinctly different from Scalia. “Scalia’s writing seemed dismissive to the claims of gay rights,” said Melissa Hart, professor at the University of Colorado Law School who worked with Gorsuch. “Everything I know about Neil Gorsuch as a person leads me to believe he would not be dismissive of anyone’s claims, regardless of how he rules. I’m not saying I think he will rule in favor of LGBT rights but I don’t think he will be dismissive of anyone’s claims.” Hart said she believes Gorsuch is “more than qualified to be on the supreme court”, echoing an op-ed in the New York Times by Neal Katyal, a former acting solicitor general under Barack Obama, that called for liberals to back Gorsuch. “I understand the political reasons for wanting to block the nomination,” Hart said, “but I don’t think there’s a principled reason to reject Neil Gorsuch as a jurist.” Neil McGill Gorsuch was born on 29 August 1967 and grew up in Denver, Colorado. His family moved to Washington, DC, after Ronald Reagan nominated his mother, Anne Gorsuch Burford, to head the Environmental Protection Agency. Gorsuch attended Georgetown preparatory school, Columbia University, Harvard Law school and Oxford University, where he enrolled on a Marshall scholarship and earned a doctorate. He fits the mold of every sitting justice on the US supreme court in educational pedigree: they all went to Harvard or Yale for law school. Post-graduation, Gorsuch worked for a decade representing mostly corporate clients at the Washington law firm of Kellogg Huber Hansen Todd Evans & Figel. But Mark Hansen, the nominee’s former boss at the firm, told the Denver Post that Gorsuch was a “regular person”. “He acts and relates well to all people, and he did the same sort of thing in trial, where he was very good at making connections with jurors,” Hansen said. “He’s a regular person. It’s part of being a Westerner.” At Oxford, Gorsuch met his future wife, Louise Gorsuch, a UK citizen. With their two teenage daughters they lives outside Boulder, Colorado, where Gorsuch indulges hobbies including fly-fishing, hiking and rowing. After his 2005 essay subtly celebrating the re-election of George W Bush, Gorsuch got good news from the administration. Gorsuch was to be appointed to the 10th circuit appeals court, which covers all or part of Colorado, Kansas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Utah and Wyoming. In 2006, when it came time for the Senate to review his nomination, Gorsuch was confirmed in the most expeditious way possible, by a voice vote and encountering no objection. This time may be different. With reporting by Ben Jacobs",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"The Guardian view on Brexit: more haste, less speed", "content": "In the end, 47 Labour MPs decided to vote against the bill triggering article 50. Two more frontbenchers, Dawn Butler and Rachel Maskell, resigned in order to vote against Jeremy Corbyn’s ill-advised three-line whip. Many MPs, in two days of often deeply felt debate, said they felt bound to honour their voters’ wishes despite their belief that leaving the EU will be a disaster for the economy, and regardless of the majority for remain among people who would normally vote Labour. The difficulty of this vote for the party was etched on the face of the shadow Brexit secretary, Sir Keir Starmer, as he wove his way through the mess of conflicting ambitions that constitute current party policy. We would rather that the party had voted with its heart than, as it perhaps did, with an eye on its electoral prospects in leave areas like Stoke and Copeland. We would say the same about the Conservative remainers too. But Labour’s equivocations on Europe long predated the vote and will continue long after. Yet unless it can find a stronger position to unite around on such a central issue, Labour will struggle to be a credible party of opposition. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Brexit debate: the best Commons speeches, from Ken Clarke to Nick Clegg But Labour’s dismal performance is not the real scandal of Wednesday’s vote, and those who pretend it is are playing the leavers’ game. The real scandal is that, with the distinguished exception of Ken Clarke, the Tory party’s many remainers bent the knee. As a result, the government had an overwhelming majority on the second reading of the bill to trigger article 50. Its failure to publish a white paper before the debate went unpunished. This disregard for the most basic of requirements for a decision of such consequence must not be allowed to be a taste of things to come. It is all the more alarming that, as late as Tuesday, it seems no draft had been circulated: the home secretary, a member of the small group of senior ministers who sit on the cabinet committee on Brexit, told MPs she had not seen it. Yet, even as the potentially grim consequences of Brexit become clearer, Theresa May’s timetable for the process of departure remains on track. It is not all over, however. Everything is still possible. Now the prime minister must come clean about the choices that lie ahead, and their consequences – and she must convey to the whole of Britain the scale of the task ahead. Even without a white paper, it is clear that she puts controlling borders and repatriating law at the head of her list of priorities. It is also clear, as George Osborne told the Commons, that at the head of the EU’s list is the integrity of the union of the remaining 27 members. Those governing ideas will, unavoidably, make many of the other ambitions that Mrs May set out in her speech a fortnight ago extremely challenging. The negotiations will be just that – negotiations that must be conducted with the intention of reaching an agreement that is acceptable for both sides. It is an irony that Mrs May will not appreciate that the European court of justice from which she so ardently wishes to escape is highly likely to be called in to adjudicate on aspects of the final deal, as its president Koen Lenaerts points out. Mrs May talks ominously about no deal being better than a bad deal, and claims to be prepared to crash out on World Trade Organisation terms. This is a terrible strategy. As the SNP’s Westminster leader, Angus Robertson, put it at prime minister’s questions, Mrs May has made one successful foreign trip in the past week. That was her trip to Dublin, where she and the Irish taoiseach, Enda Kenny, discussed how best to preserve the free trade area and protect the Northern Ireland peace process. She would do well to take the lesson about the value of negotiations conducted in good faith and a spirit of cooperation. A hard Brexit would be ruinous. Every MP should spend the coming week consulting their local businesses on the impact of WTO terms, and calculate their likely impact on jobs and prices. The referendum itself has been a catastrophe. But if Mrs May continues to treat leaving the EU as if it can be achieved in a couple of years of hard work, she is doing the voters a grave disservice. She knows the cost of making pledges on immigration that are unachievable. Suggesting that Brexit can be done and dusted before the next election is a deceit on a monstrous scale. As Sir Ivan Rogers, the former UK ambassador to the EU, told MPs on the Brexit committee on Wednesday morning, the task ahead was “humongous”. It would, unavoidably, be bloody.

{ "title":"Banks may groan – but Andrew Tyrie is right to launch a new inquiry", "content": "It’s been ages – actually only three years – since the last parliamentary inquiry into the banking industry, but here comes the tireless Andrew Tyrie with another. The Treasury select committee is to ask whether the revamped capital rules, supported by arrangements to wind down failing banks, are up to the job. Taxpayers are supposed to be protected in another 2008-style crisis. Would they be? A collective groan, one suspects, will have passed across the banking sector at news of this inquiry. The so-called capital and resolution regime, after years of debate and fine-tuning, is supposed to be set in stone. The regulators perform stress tests on the big institutions every year; and the banks’ role is to get on with the job of reorganising their operations to fit the new ringfenced model while reordering their capital structures to contain the correct portion of instruments capable of absorbing losses. MPs to test rules aimed at insuring against UK bank bailouts Read more Yet there are at least three reasons why Tyrie is right to have a prod. First, Sir John Vickers, one of the architects of ringfencing, is not convinced that the banks yet hold enough capital. The Bank of England disagrees, pointing out that the UK brigade has raised £130bn of new equity since the 2008, about twice the level of losses experience in the crisis. But that debate needs to be settled once and for all, preferably before the next crisis arrives. Second, the current crisis in the Italian banking industry is a reminder that talk of state-funded bailouts has not been banished forever, at least in the eurozone. The Italian banks may, in the end, get all their capital from the private sector, but it is not reassuring that there is even room for doubt. UK taxpayers deserve to hear, in detail, how it could never happen again here. Third, Royal Bank of Scotland is still 73% owned by taxpayers. To what degree is the state still on the hook should calamity strike? The select committee, let’s hope, will be reassured. But this is the right moment to ask hard questions. Here’s one for Tyrie to add to his list: given that the ringfencing rules don’t come fully into force until 2019, how would the too-big-to-fail question be addressed before that date? Regulators tend to mutter and obfuscate when the question is put directly. Tyrie could do us all a favour by insisting on clarity. Drax fired up after EU nod It is only a slight exaggeration to say that Drax Group had bet the farm on winning EU state-aid approval to convert a third coal-burning unit to run on wood pellets. Without a thumbs-up, Drax would not have been able to afford its planned corporate reinvention via the £340m purchase of Opus Energy, a supply business serving small and medium-sized businesses. That deal, unveiled earlier this month, was conditional on Brussels coming good. There was relief all round, then, that EU approval arrived, just as the long-serving chief executive, Dorothy Thompson, predicted. The handout may only be a last hurrah for biomass subsidies since the last UK government made clear its preference for offshore wind in the renewables stakes. But there’s nothing like the sight of guaranteed income – Drax will get £100 a megawatt hour at the converted unit – to lift an energy generator’s spirits. Drax’s shares rose 8% and have now improved by a quarter since the Opus announcement. Justified? Yes, probably. A month ago, Drax, the UK’s largest power station, seemed destined to become an exercise in managed decline. Now “retooling for a post-coal future” – the clunky corporate slogan – may mean something tangible. Aside from coal and biomass, Drax will have a beefed-up supply business plus development sites to get into gas-fired stations one day. It is an odd collection of assets that one probably wouldn’t design from scratch. But, yes, given Drax’s turbulent history, one can call it a sensible diversification of risk. Apple’s rotten jibe at Vestager The great EU versus Apple and Ireland tax battle will be fought on facts, in particular the right of Brussels’ competition commissioner to intervene in the tax affairs of an EU member state. The legal scrap will take years. In the meantime, though, note Apple’s petulant line about why it thinks it found itself in the sights of Margrethe Vestager. The Danish EU commissioner wanted a target that “generates lots of headlines”, claims the US technology company. This is self-regarding nonsense. When the sum at stake is €13bn (£10.8bn) in allegedly unpaid taxes, Vestager would be failing in her job if she didn’t act.",diasaster:0},

{ "title":"Are five-hour waits for ambulances the sad state of our healthcare system?", "content": "The first sign of trouble was the sound of a smash. There on my street in Kentish Town, north London, was a sheepish looking teenager on a moped, another sitting down, and a third lying in the road, groaning. Otherwise the street was deserted. At first it appeared the boy on his back, who I’ll call Nathan, was just drunk and embarrassed. But the scream when he tried to move his leg suggested otherwise. So I called 999. It was 1.12am on Monday morning, and three degrees below freezing. The events that followed are small in the scheme of things. But the inadequacies of the response to Nathan’s accident raise troubling questions about the state of our ambulance services, and the ground-level consequences of cuts that can often seem like a political abstraction. Once the situation was explained, the operator said he couldn’t be sure when an ambulance would be available. Nathan’s mates left. (Police believe the moped was stolen.) Two other neighbours brought blankets and pillows. Operators called back a few times, to little effect. Nathan, who’s 16, seemed to be in shock. He required repeated reassurance that he wasn’t going to die. After half an hour, the police arrived. Initially, they seemed more concerned about the alleged moped theft – they’d had a run-in with Nathan and his mates earlier that night – than about his injury. But as they realised that he wasn’t putting it on, their focus changed. And they were clearly exasperated. Over the radio, they were told that an ambulance was out of the question. The service was in a “surge purple enhanced” state, once vanishingly rare, now quite common, and, the London ambulance service (LAS) says, particularly so in the last month. That status means that only life or death calls will get an ambulance. The best estimate they could give on an arrival time for Nathan was five hours. It wasn’t even a Friday or a Saturday night, one dismayed officer pointed out. “This is the only real incident we’re dealing with in the whole borough right now,” he said, “and we still can’t get an ambulance.” But what could they do? Nathan was getting colder. One of the officers was a trained emergency medical technician (EMT), and he was concerned that the boy was showing signs of hypothermia. He wanted to get him to hospital as quickly as possible, before things got worse. They tried to move him, but his screams were so severe that they gave that up pretty fast. The trained EMT radioed to ask if he could go and pick up gas and air from the local hospital to administer himself, but the request was denied. Nathan’s mum arrived. At first she was angry with her son. “If you were at home in bed and not out on the street this wouldn’t be happening,” she said. But she soon softened, kneeling to stroke her son’s hair as he moaned and shivered. Still no ambulance. No pain relief. Eventually, one of the officers puffed out his cheeks. “OK, mate,” he said. “It looks like you’re going to have to man up.” Just after 2.50 am, seven police officers surrounded Nathan, unwrapped his duvet swaddling, and tried, as tenderly as they could, to move him into the back of their van. Nathan did his best to man up, but he’s not actually a man yet, and he had been lying in the road with a badly broken leg for an hour and 38 minutes. As he screamed, his mother wept a few feet away. Statistics published by LAS hint at why this has happened: after years of reaching their benchmark of getting to 75% or more of the most serious calls within eight minutes, performance has dipped markedly. In May the figure across London was 69%; in October, it was 58%. LAS insists this has nothing to do with a cut in funding of 19% between 2011 and 2015. They blame a skills shortage, and an unexplained growth in serious calls – 10% up on last year. They say they’re on a recruitment drive. Unison, who represent ambulance staff, are not impressed – the local branch secretary says paramedics are leaving London because they can get more money elsewhere, and talks about a “tidal wave” of departures – and neither were the police officers on my street. More and more ambulance services were being put on their shoulders, they said, making it harder for them to do the work that is more properly theirs. Nathan was given morphine as soon as he arrived at hospital. He turned out to have fractures to his femur and his kneecap. On Monday afternoon he was in surgery. He was never in danger of dying, it’s true, and if he had been, an ambulance would have come. In a statement, LAS said they were sorry that no ambulance could attend, blaming a high number of life-or-death calls. But is that the standard we now set? And if we now accept that children with multiple fractures are to be left to lie freezing cold in the road in the middle of the night, shouldn’t we be asking how our expectations got so low? • This article was amended on 30 December. An earlier version said the growth in serious calls was up 27% on last year. That proportion was in fact 10%.",diasaster:0},

{ "title":"The Guardian view on international aid: less fury, more light", "content": "The assaults on Britain’s international development budget and the parallel assault on salaries that some charities pay their chief executives are being merged into a single weapon of attack. The aim is to unpick the legal commitment to dedicating 0.7% of GDP to aid after the next election. Some media organisations have always been hostile to any attempt to support the development of poorer countries; but the attacks of the past month have reached extraordinary depths. And, while not all the claims are justified, some of them are. The voluntary sector has to do more to get out and explain why its chief executives and other senior officers are worth paying four or five times more than the median wage, and at the same time charities need to develop a culture of openness about projects that work, and the ones that don’t. Pay for senior staff in the charitable sector has often been open to criticism: it is always jarring to see a charity appealing for donations from members of the public – many of them not that well off themselves – and then to learn that top staff in that charity are paid hundreds of thousands of pounds. There is a disconnect in perceptions: while charity appeals to the generosity of ordinary people, some charities are multimillion-pound organisations that play a global role in developing and delivering aid and lobbying governments. There is a defence, as the chief executive of the Alzheimer’s Society argued last year after the Sun picked up on its accounts showing that half its income was spent on staff costs. Most of its 2,500 staff work on the frontline with very vulnerable people. The great majority of charities – like the inspiring winners of the Guardian’s charity awards last week – are small and work in their local communities to deal with particular problems, and pay little more than the average wage. The big charities argue that they pay their bosses broadly in line with other organisations of a similar size, and that their overall pay bill is falling. Five questions we should be asking about the impact of UK aid | Mark Goldring Read more The question of aid effectiveness, the second prong of the current attack, is even more contested. As the Guardian found during its rural development project in Katine, north-east Uganda, doing good development aid – as opposed to emergency aid – is a slow and complex business that involves multiple players. It is about identifying need and securing local buy-in, engaging with local leaders and politicians, taking two steps forwards and sometimes two steps backwards as well. And even then results may not be what had been foreseen, and often depend on external factors that cannot be predicted. There are important and difficult questions, too, about the best methods of development, such as the importance of security, and the choice of priorities between supporting economic development or providing health facilities. These are all big and legitimate areas for debate. So is the argument about the significance of Britain’s national interest. But it is not the debate that is happening. The international development secretary, Priti Patel, grandstands her scepticism about aid – sometimes, it seems, about the very principle of it – and is cheered on by her allies in the media. The NGOs that often rely on Department for International Development contracts for their survival keep their heads down for fear of being named and shamed. Development matters. So stop the name calling and start a constructive conversation about how to do it better.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Marais: the chic Paris district where rats outnumber residents", "content": "It is nightfall in Paris’s chic Marais district – one of the city’s oldest quarters – and there is a rustling in the autumn leaves of the local park. With a slither of tails, the rats emerge from the shadows to scurry across the pavement, hugging the walls of buildings for a collective raid on the nearest rubbish bins. There are few people about at this hour, but those who spot the rodents suppress a shocked squeal. “I’ve lived here for 10 years and have never seen rats in this square before. But now they are very present. You rarely see them during the day, but after dusk they run out along the pavement into the street to raid the litter bins,” said one local resident who watched half a dozen rodents scamper away as she unlocked her front door. Man v rat: could the long war soon be over? | Jordan Kisner Read more The next day on Boulevard Richard-Lenoir, Anne-Laure is out walking her dog. It is a clear, crisp morning and the rodents are out in force, seemingly undaunted by daylight or passersby. “We’re used to the rats by now. They come, they go. They’re not really any worse than the pigeons, but it’s unnerving to see so many of them,” Anne-Laure said. Parisians have lived with rats since the city was founded. If there’s a bustle in the hedgerow, no need to be alarmed; chances are it is a rodent. At dusk they can be spotted across the city, even on the world’s most famous boulevard, the Champs Elysées, dashing across a pavement or parkways. Even in the metro, they scamper along the platforms searching for food left by passengers or the homeless spending the night in the subway network. Mostly they stick to the sewers, but recently they have started coming to the surface in increasing numbers, attracted by casually, or even deliberately, thrown food. The Disney film Ratatouille tried to make them more sympathetic, though the scene where thousands tumble through the shattered ceiling on to the head of an elderly pensioner remains a haunting one, and its star, Rémy, was a master of French haute cuisine. But as the credits rolled, it was hard to escape the fact that, sympathetic or not, Rémy was still a rat. Now that Paris’s rat population is thought to have exploded to more than 4m – about two for every one of the 2.3 million city dwellers – Paris city hall has embarked on yet another campaign to eradicate a seasonal plague. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Rats scurry across the lawn in the Saint Jacques Tower park in the centre of Paris. Photograph: Francois Mori/AP Dr Georges Salines, head of the Paris environmental service that deals with rats, says the fight to control them has been hit partly by a change in European regulations concerning poisons. “For example, we can no longer put the poisoned grains that we used before at the exit of their burrows in parks,” he told journalists. Nine city parks were closed at the end of November for a “de-ratting programme”. Officials and health experts hope by removing humans, who leave food and detritus in the park on which the rodents feed, the animals will be attracted to the poison baits. Le Parisien reported that a pair of breeding rats could produce 936 offspring in two years. City hall insists the rodent population has not actually exploded, but the media has made Parisiens more aware of them. A spokeswoman said the problem was “no worse than before”. “It’s been in the media and they’ve been seen in tourist areas like the Champs Elysées, so everyone thinks there are more. We’ve closed the parks because, believe or not, people actually feed them.” Pierre Falgayrac, an independent expert who has spent hours in the Paris sewers studying rats, told Le Monde that there was nothing to be alarmed about. “In major cities like Paris, built in the 19th century and blessed with sewers at the heart of the city, there are around 1.75 rats per inhabitant. It’s when the density increases to more than two rats per inhabitant that the problems start.” Falgayrac says rats needs three things to thrive: water, food and a place to build a nest. If deprived of one they cease to breed. “They’re not invaders or conquerers ... its life space is limited to 20 square metres and it will spend 75% of its life in that space. We have to balance the fear-mongering about rats. They’re not intrinsically aggressive ... they’re mostly gentle, peaceful and fearful. “Once the population is down to less than one rat per head of population, nobody will notice them,” Falgayrac said. Meanwhile, Parisien Jo Benchetrit has launched a petition called “Stop the Rat Genocide” and has denounced city hall’s “rat phobia”.",diasaster:0},

He could not help it: fog drifts through his memory, shrouding information registered moments – or years – earlier. Concussion medic didn't identify head trauma syndrome as Will Smith film claims, say doctors Read more In his prime as a defensive lineman for the San Francisco 49ers Visger smashed through opponents with raw, physical, power, a 6ft 5in block of muscle and grit. Now aged 56, homeless and jobless in Sacramento, he battles mental obstacles with Post-it notes and waterproof notebooks, hundreds of waterproof notebooks, scribbled with details he might otherwise forget – whom he speaks to, the reason he goes somewhere, where he parks. The system does not always work. Once, coming out of Home Depot, he found a strange car where his truck should have been. He roved the parking lot for 65 minutes, repeatedly returning to the spot, baffled, until he remembered his truck was being repaired and that he had borrowed a buddy’s car. He had been driving it for a week. “I remember what’s in here, though,” Visger said this week. There was a rattling sound as he rummaged in the glove compartment. “My little brain drain emergency kit.” The plastic box contains an antiseptic pad, a razor, a syringe and a note from his doctor about how to siphon excess spinal fluid from a dime-sized hole in the side of Visger’s skull if he falls into a coma. He brings the kit everywhere hopeful that in an emergency someone, anyone, will follow the instructions. “This is how I frigging have to live.” As America sits down to one of the year’s biggest football weekends the film Concussion, which launches in US cinemas on Christmas Day, is raising awareness about the game’s human cost. Based on a true story, Will Smith plays Bennet Omalu, a Nigerian forensic pathologist who discovered a disease, chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), devastating former players. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Nigerian-born forensic pathologist Bennet Omalu detailed the effects of chronic traumatic encephalopathy in American football players. Photograph: Joshua Bright for the Guardian His autopsy of the former Pittsburgh Steeler “Iron Mike” Webster in 2002 helped to explain how the Hall of Fame athlete, considered one of the best centres in National Football League (NFL) history, fell into dementia, depression and destitution. Before his death at the age of 50 Webster put Super Glue on his rotting teeth and used a Taser gun to ease back pain. Omalu linked Webster’s suffering to repeated blows to the head during games, a finding with profound and disturbing implications for all football players, amateur and professional. The NFL denied it and tried to discredit Omalu but mounting scientific evidence, congressional hearings and a class action lawsuit by former players forced the league, which dominates American sport and television ratings, to recognise the crisis. The settlement, approved earlier this year by a federal judge, could cost the NFL $1bn over 65 years. It expects 6,000 of nearly 20,000 retired players to eventually suffer from Alzheimer’s disease or moderate dementia. Band of former NFL players oppose league's $1bn concussion settlement Read more The league has taken steps to protect players, it said in a statement. “These include nearly 40 rule changes in the last decade, strict concussion protocols, and better training and sideline medical care. We are seeing measurable results, including a 34% decrease in concussions in NFL games since the 2012 season.” Critics say the changes don’t go far enough. “Brain and non-brain injuries are unacknowledged cornerstones and artifacts of football participation,” said Don Brady, a psychologist who has written papers on the subject. “It’s not just suffering one or more concussions that causes brain damage, it’s also the accumulation of sub-concussive impacts.” Beloved national obsession or brain-destroying brutality, the debate over football blazes in courtrooms and television studios and soon movie theatres. Many former players, however, feel they inhabit a private shadowland, a dark labyrinth of confusion, depression, financial ruin and broken relationships. “It’s been devastating, you know. Once you get injured the game turns on you,” said the slow, measured voice of Dave Pear, 62, a former defensive lineman for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and a Super Bowl champion with the Oakland Raiders. “They convinced me to play with a broken neck for several years.” Since retiring in 1980 he has had 15 surgeries on his neck, back, hips, knees. Pear suffers vertigo and walks with a cane. The pain never stops. He fought repeated court battles to extract worker compensation from the Raiders. Then battled the NFL to compensate his brain injuries. Pear runs an influential players’ blog but speaking from his home near Seattle his concentration occasionally wavered. “Oh, I’m sorry. Where was I?” he asked several times, mid-sentence. “I can’t remember things. I get headaches. I fall asleep during the day.” He paused. “I can’t remember things.” Nudged back on to the NFL settlement, he focused. “They’re trying to act like they’re doing something. They’re helping the younger players but the older players – they’re waiting for us to die.” The league vigorously disputes that and points to funding for independent scientific and medical research and the development of better protective equipment. But among older players it’s a common sentiment: once gods on the field, courted by teams and worshipped by fans, they now feel like human refuse, dumped and forgotten. “I’ve lost my home, my consulting business, I’m getting divorced after 20 years, I can’t sleep, I need my shoulder replaced but that would mean not driving for six months so I can’t do that, I’ve had nine brain surgeries, I can’t remember anything so everyone around me is pissed off. It’s a frigging nightmare,” said Visger, the former 49er. “I’m smart, a man of integrity, but I just can’t remember things.” Visger had a typical rise up the football ranks: starting at the age of 11 in Pop Warner, the youth league, defensive tackle for his Stockton high school team, a football scholarship to the University of Colorado, graduating to the 49ers. In an era when the head was viewed as a battering ram and only “pussies” complained about pain, his experience with head injuries was also typical: badly concussed at the age of 13, he went on to suffer repeated “dings”, including a major concussion in the first quarter of a Dallas game in 1980, yet continued playing with the aid of smelling salts. By 1981 headaches, vomiting and bright, blinding lights were a daily reality. Eventually a team doctor diagnosed brain haemorrhaging and hydrocephalus, also known as water on the brain. A surgeon inserted a shunt into his brain. Visger retired from the game aged 23. He completed a biology degree, did wildlife surveys for an environmental consultancy, married and fathered two children. But gradually his memory became a sieve. Invoicing, returning calls, grocery shopping, tasks big and small, they all leaked. Filling notebooks helped him to function but he became cranky and disorientated, lashed out at those around him. His career and marriage crumbled. Doctors diagnosed cognitive impairment, chronic traumatic brain injury, frontal and temporal lobe disorders and generalized seizure disorder. Visger adds CTE to the list, but confirmation must await a postmortem. He qualified for California Workers Compensation, yielding $1,750 social security disability a month, but missed out on the NFL settlement because his professional career lasted less than four years. “Nine brain surgeries and do I qualify for NFL compensation? Hell no.” Still, Visger said he counted his blessings. “Honest to God, I’m doing great compared to other guys.” Facebook Twitter Pinterest The New England Patriots linebacker Junior Seau was posthumously inducted into the hall of fame. Photograph: Charles Krupa/AP That is true. There has been a spate of suicides, including Junior Seau, who shot himself in the chest in 2012 to preserve his brain for study. Of 92 NFL players whose brains were tested posthumously at Boston University, 88 showed evidence of CTE. This week brought confirmation of another case: Frank Gifford, a Hall of Fame running back who died in August, aged 84. Physical pain from injuries is bad enough but the loneliness and alienation of a mental disorder can be worse, said Scott Gilchrist, 54, the son of Cookie Gilchrist, a legendary 1950s star fullback. As Cookie’s memory unravelled he recorded thousands of monologues and conversations in an attempt to make sense of things. “My brother and I used to think, oh, the old man’s crazy, but now I understand,” said Scott. He understands, he said, because two years ago he fell from scaffolding, causing brain bleeding and other symptoms. “Short-term memory, being fixated on certain events, getting mad at little things.” Football authorities say rule changes, such as reducing head contact in drills and banning the most egregious, intentional clashes during games, have made the game safer. “Like never before there’s acceptance that we have to make these changes. I think there has been a lot of positive change,” said Julian Bailes, head of neurosurgery at the NorthShore Neurological Institute and chair of the Pop Warner medical advisory board. Last year just 1% of youth league players were concussed, a fall from about 5% in previous years, he said. The NFL has also made important strides, he said. “I don’t know that there’s a whole lot more than can be done.” Bailes, who allowed his two teenage sons to play middle school football, is no NFL apologist: he supported Omalu during his lonely battle to expose CTE. (Alec Baldwin plays him in Concussion.) Michael MacCambridge, author of America’s Game: The Epic Story of How Pro Football Captured a Nation, also saw progress. “I’m not saying football is safe but compared to a decade ago I see a more concerted effort by the league to address players’ safety.” Would MacCambridge let his teenage son play? “I’d have to think about it. I believe I’d say yes.” Critics are unconvinced. They say concussions often go unreported, that cumulative sub-concussive knocks still cause long-term damage, and that safety rules are often ignored. Earlier this season, officials let the St Louis Rams’ quarterback Case Keenum stay on the field, concussed and staggering, after being slammed into the turf, prompting an inquiry. Better equipment and new rules, even if enforced, do not compensate for the impact of bigger, stronger, faster players – giants compared to predecessors, said Pear. “It’s like playing in the freeway with cars going 80mph. It’s not a contact sport, it’s a collision sport.” Visger agreed. “The kinetic energy that these guys generate is just incredible.” Both veterans believe violence is inherent to the game – and the league’s $10bn revenues. “Most people have jobs they hate and on the weekend just want to go out and be entertained,” said Pear. “People want to see nice catches and nice runs, sure. But listen to the crowd roar when there’s a big hit.” Facebook Twitter Pinterest Big hits are an essential part of the game. Photograph: John Pyle/Zuma Press/Corbis Visger concurred, saying the damage he inflicted would have landed him in jail if done anywhere except the field. “People love to see guys getting blown up. The game is designed to knock the shit out of your opponent.” Buzz Bissinger, the author of Friday Night Lights, advocated greater safety measures until an epiphany in 2011, when he declared football a celebration of violence. “It is why we like it. Take it away, continue efforts to curtail the savagery, and the game will be nothing, regardless of age or skill.” In a Bloomberg survey last year half of respondents said they would not want their son to play football. Could it go the way of boxing: a moneyed but marginalised, discredited sport? Participation in Pop Warner fell from 248,899 in 2010 to 225,287 in 2012 but since then numbers have stabilised, said Josh Pruce, a league spokesman. Anecdotal evidence, however, suggests trouble in the pipeline. “I hear more parents telling me they won’t let their kids play until high school,” said Dustin Fink, an Illinois athletic trainer who blogs about brain injuries but adores football. “I think there’ll be a tipping point into people abandoning the sport.” Others predict an accelerated dwindling of white players, leaving African Americans, currently two-thirds of the NFL roster, increasingly prevalent. Young black men, many from poor backgrounds, risking their lives and health to enrich the white plutocrats who comprise team owners and gambling moguls: a troubling image for the NFL. “It’s very sad, but that’s the truth,” said Robert Lee, who runs the Independent Football Veterans site. Jeanne-Marie Laskas, a journalist whose GQ article and book, Concussion, inspired the film, reckoned the cultural and commercial juggernaut known as American football will roll on regardless. “What will penetrate the culture until people say, wait a second? We as fans are complicit because we watch and love the hits. We just love it too much.” Laskas recently attended the funeral of Fred McNeill, a former Minnesota Viking who died at the age of 63. After quitting football he built a thriving law practice, a brilliant, accomplished man. Then, gradually, he lost his memory and his mind, shattering his family, said Laskas. She no longer watches games. “It’s not a moral position. It’s because it’s disturbing to me.”",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"The truth is rushing out there: why conspiracy theories spread faster than ever", "content": "“I remember reading about Final Fantasy VII, a movie I was really looking forward to. My initial reaction was disappointment that it was two years away – because by then we’d be under military control.” It was 2004, and Matthew Elliott was in deep. An ordinary guy from San Antonio, Texas, he had first been drawn to conspiracy theories when he was 19, in the aftermath of 9/11. “It seemed unfathomable that we could be attacked,” he says today. In his quest to make sense of what had happened he came across the notorious “truther” movement, a current of opinion that lays blame for the atrocities at the door of the US government. Why are conspiracy theories so attractive? podcast Read more “The way most conspiracy theories are laid out, one thing always leads to another, so from there I became convinced that a ruling group called the New World Order orchestrated everything. This would all lead to martial law and a complete removal of our freedoms,” he says. A decade later, Elliott, now 34, is a “recovering” conspiracy theorist, having turned his back on a worldview that always posits some covert, powerful force acting against the interests of ordinary people. The change came gradually, but he thinks very differently now. “You can’t even get many of the 50 states to agree on things. Good luck convincing Europeans and Asians to get on board.” Elliott’s reaction to the trauma of 9/11 was far from unusual. The attacks were so unprecedented, so devastating, that many of us struggled to make sense of them. Early reports were confused or contradictory: as a result some treated the official version of events with scepticism. A proportion of those in turn plumped for an explanation that would require fakery and coordination on a massive scale. This shouldn’t surprise us: it’s a pattern that is repeated after every global shock, and in the aftermath of the Paris attacks, it has reared its head again. Within a day of the terrorist attacks on the French capital, blogs had been published arguing that they were the work of the government – a so-called “false flag” operation. The claims rest on the idea that Isis is the deliberate creation of western governments. More recently, the lawyer for the family of Syed Farook, one of the San Bernardino shooters, fuelled conspiratorial speculation when he said: “There’s a lot of motivation at this time to emphasise or create incidents that will cause gun control or prejudice or hatred towards the Muslim community.” The internet speeds everything up, allowing conspiracy-minded individuals to connect and formulate their ideas Viren Swami Round-the-clock coverage of global events means there is a constant supply of crisis and chaos for us to interpret. Stories of strings being pulled by hidden hands are a staple of our entertainment, from Spectre’s Blofeld to the baroque conspiracy of London Spy, one of the most acclaimed British dramas of the year, which unravelled in a spectacular example of the paranoid style. It’s not that belief in conspiracy theories is becoming more widespread, says Viren Swami, professor of social psychology at Anglia Ruskin university: while the research hasn’t been done yet, he tells me, there’s lots of anecdotal evidence to suggest that belief in conspiracies has remained fairly stable for the last half-century or so. What has changed, however, is the speed with which new theories are formed. “It’s a symptom of a much more integrated world,” he says. The internet speeds everything up, allowing conspiracy-minded individuals to connect and formulate their ideas. In contrast, it took months for theories about Pearl Harbor to develop. Karen Douglas, another social psychologist, echoes this point. “People’s communication patterns have changed quite a lot over the last few years. It’s just so much easier for people to get access to conspiracy information even if they have a little seed of doubt about an official story. It’s very easy to go online and find other people who feel the same way as you.” Is everyone prone to this kind of thinking, or is it the preserve of an extreme fringe? Douglas reckons it’s more common than most of us realise. “Recent research has shown that about half of Americans believe at least one conspiracy theory,” she says. “You’re looking at average people; people you might come across on the street.” That’s also the view of Rob Brotherton, whose new book, Suspicious Minds, explores the traits that predispose us to belief in conspiracies. He cautions against sitting in judgment, since all of us have suspicious minds – and for good reason. Identifying patterns and being sensitive to possible threats is what has helped us survive in a world where nature often is out to get you. “Conspiracy theory books tend to come at it from the point of view of debunking them. I wanted to take a different approach, to sidestep the whole issue of whether the theories are true or false and come at it from the perspective of psychology,” he says. “The intentionality bias, the proportionality bias, confirmation bias. We have these quirks built into our minds that can lead us to believe weird things without realising that’s why we believe them.” Facebook Twitter Pinterest Ben Whishaw in London Spy, one of the most acclaimed British dramas of the year, which unravelled in a spectacular example of the paranoid style. Photograph: BBC/WTTV “Whenever anything ambiguous happens, we have this bias towards assuming that it was intended – that somebody planned it, that there was some kind of purpose or agency behind it, rather than thinking it was just an accident, or chaos, or an unintended consequence of something.” This intentionality bias, Brotherton says, can be detected from early childhood. “If you ask a young kid why somebody sneezed, the kid thinks that they did it on purpose, that the person must really enjoy sneezing. It’s only after about the age of four or five that we begin to learn that not everything that everybody does is intended. We’re able to override that automatic judgment. But research shows that it still stays with us even into adulthood.” For example, studies have shown that when people drink alcohol, they are more likely to interpret ambiguous actions as having been deliberate. “So if you’re at the pub and somebody jostles you and spills your drink, if it’s your first drink, you might write it off as an innocent mistake. But if you’re a few drinks in, then you’re more likely to think they did it on purpose, that it was an aggressive act.” Like most personality traits, proneness to intentionality bias varies across the population. “Some people are more susceptible to it than others.” And, Brotherton explains, there is a small but reliable correlation between that susceptibility and belief in conspiracy theories. 9/11 truthers (naturally) wary of Osama bin Laden's conspiracy theory obsession Read more External factors also play a part, of course. For Ryan, who asked that I omit his last name, the influence of a single charismatic individual was crucial. It was Johnny, a friend and bandmate, who showed him books and CDs about world government and “served as a guru of sorts”. At the same time as inducting him into the truther movement, “he was introducing me to music I’d never heard and really loved”. At the height of his involvement, Ryan says he believed a broad range of conspiracy theories, including “chemtrails” – the idea that the trails left by planes contain noxious chemicals intended to subdue or poison people; that Aids and Ebola were introduced by governments to control population; that the moon landings were faked; that a substance extracted from apricots called laetrile was an effective cure for cancer, but had been banned by the FDA and dismissed as quackery to protect the interests of Big Pharma. “I strained my relationships with my family badly. It’s always the ones you love the most that you want to ‘wake up’. I ended up in hugely embarrassing debates and arguments,” he says. But beyond the anguish it caused for those close to him, were Ryan’s unorthodox beliefs harmful? Karen Douglas is wary of rubbishing all conspiracy theorising as dangerous. “Thinking in that way, it must have some positive consequences. If everybody went around just accepting what they were told by governments, officials, pharmaceutical companies, whoever, then we would be a bunch of sheep, really”. On the other hand, the effects of certain theories on behaviour can be damaging. Douglas’s own research [pdf download] has shown that exposure to the idea that the British government was involved in the death of Princess Diana reduced people’s intention to engage in politics. Similarly, subjects who read a text stating that climate change was a hoax by scientists seeking funding were less likely to want to take action to reduce their carbon footprint. And anti-vaccine conspiracy narratives make people less likely to vaccinate their children, a clear public health risk. If everybody just accepted what they were told by governments and pharmaceutical companies, we would be a bunch of sheep Karen Douglas Should we try to stamp conspiracy theories out, then? Part of Brotherton’s argument is that they’re a natural consequence of the way our brains have evolved. Not only that, but trying to disprove them can backfire. “Any time you start trying to debunk conspiracy theories, for the people who really believe, that’s exactly what they would expect if the conspiracy were real,” he says. Swami sees things differently. “Experimental work that we’ve done shows that it’s possible to reduce conspiracist ideation.” How? Swami found that people who had been encouraged to think analytically during a verbal task were less likely to accept conspiracy theories afterwards. For him, this hints at an important potential role for education. “The best way is, at a societal level, to promote analytical thinking, to teach critical thinking skills.” But that’s not all. When people have faith in their representatives, understand what they are doing and trust that they are not corrupt, they are less likely to believe in coverups. That’s why political transparency ought to be bolstered wherever possible – and corporate transparency, too. “A lot of people have trouble accepting a big organisation’s or government’s narratives of an event, because they’re seen as untrustworthy, they’re seen as liars,” argues Swami. The Earth is flat? What planet is he on? Read more Improved teaching and changes in political and business culture would undoubtedly help. But conspiracy theories can be rejected for personal reasons, too. Ryan’s view changed with loss of his “guru”. “I kinda dropped out of contact with Johnny after he got married and had a baby,” he says. “He was getting further and further into it, and I just couldn’t keep up with the mental gymnastics involved.” He started to look for alternative explanations – less exciting, but more plausible ones. “I looked at the people debating on the national level, for the presidency and such. No way these guys speaking in platitudes and generalisations could really be behind a global conspiracy to enslave or kill me. They weren’t doing a particularly good job of it either, considering how happy I was living my life. “That was the epiphany, really. I was free. I was happy. None of the doom and gloom predicted and promised ever came.” For Ryan, by then 27, the bizarre ride was over. A world that pitted him against the forces of evil had all the appeal of a spy drama. But real life was less like a story – and in some ways more depressing. What does he think are the forces that really shape things? “Most of what is wrong in the world nowadays – well, I would put it down to incompetence and greed. A lack of compassion.”",diasaster:0},

I fell in love with Edinburgh so intensely that I literally fell (first night, Victoria Street, knees skinned). A magical place that smells of salt, hops and sewage, and features a sizable castle sticking up in the middle, Edinburgh was mind-blowing to a young American. I happened to arrive shortly after Trainspotting was released, when the whole country seemed to be enjoying its twisted moment in the sun. Edinburgh was a city that said: “Listen, we’re not all on heroin, but we are going out tonight.” And it had a killer sense of humour. Local magazine The List had started publishing the I Saw You column, and some of the more hilarious ones from that time are burned into my memory. “I Saw You … and I’ll see you in court, Mark. Divorce is around the corner. I don’t believe you sleep in your office.” I spent my days sitting on hills, reading JM Barrie, Walter Scott, AL Kennedy, Irvine Welsh and Gordon Legge. And at night? Mostly, I drank. I wore ridiculous disposable clothes in freezing temperatures, kissed my friends at 5am, meandered around neighbourhoods not built for meandering, cupped my hand over the freshly pierced cartilage of my left ear, futilely trying to protect it from the wind. I wanted to live there forever. But I had to go back to America to graduate. America, where there was no cereal-scented wind or castled-skylines or billion-year-old graveyards. For me, America had become an empty space with no magic inside it. My parents retrieved their very sullen 20-year-old from the airport and deposited me in my childhood bedroom. There, waiting on my bed, was a 775-page brick of a book. The Best American Short Stories of the Century, edited by John Updike and inscribed by my father: “Welcome to America – we’re not so bad.” I had not spoken to my parents about how sad I was to leave Scotland. I had barely spoken to them about how much I loved it. But still, they knew. Not only that, they acted on that knowing without laundering it through their own impulses. They did not buy me thistle-patterned linens or play bagpipe recordings. This was a gift truly for me; 100 reminders of why home was still beautiful and funny and complex.

Julian Fellowes chucked in a wedding, a birth, new jobs and old fights, and a spirited version of Auld Lang Syne to wrap it all up. The big rivalry between Michelle Dockery’s Lady Mary and Laura Carmichael’s Lady Edith was resolved. Dinner at The Ritz helped. Lady Mary engineered a sneaky date with Bertie (aka the 7th Marquess of Hexham), and soon Lady Edith had fought off her destiny as the great spinster of Downton and was instead making plans for a New Year’s wedding (saves on decorations, plus it’s one less big party scene to film) and life as a Marchioness. “You’re such a paradox: you make me miserable for years, then you give me my life back,” said Edith to Mary, a line that no doubt echoes the sentiments from many of Downton’s unwilling viewers in living rooms across Britain. Lady Edith even found the courage to knock Bertie’s mother off her moral high horse with a truth bomb: admitting that ward Marigold is her illegitimate daughter. Henry Talbot (Matthew Goode, adding some last-minute class to proceedings) gazed into the distance, smoking with all the existential angst of a man about to enter a new year without much to do.

Elsewhere, the arrival of an electric hairdryer (whatever next!) prompted Daisy to chop off her hair and join the bob squad, Mr Molesley accepted a job as a teacher (but still squeezed back into his livery for New Year) and Baxter freed herself from her criminal past by … doing nothing. After all these years, it’s still hard to nail down what Downton Abbey actually is. UK critics might have been surprised to see it nominated again in this year’s US Emmy awards for best drama – the only British entry, alongside Game of Thrones, Orange Is the New Black and Mad Men.

It’s also ended up being a place where both the staff grinding away downstairs and the toffs in ball gowns upstairs have been gifted with a peculiar sense of foresight, a tangible sense of their place in history and how “things” will never be the same again, once they’re off the screen. It’s certainly the purest Sunday night soap we’ve had for years; sometimes it’s been an hour populated by 20-odd characters in search of a plot, and sometimes it’s filled with great performances and insight into class and position.

Delivering his Christmas Day homily at St Peter’s in Rome amid heavy security, the pontiff said he was praying for an end to human suffering in a world afflicted by war, poverty and extremist attacks. Francis referred to “brutal acts of terrorism” in Paris in November as well as conflicts in Africa, the Middle East and Ukraine. “Only God’s mercy can free humanity from the many forms of evil, at times monstrous evil, which selfishness spawns in our midst,” he told worshippers gathered in St Peter’s Square. Thousands of people underwent airport-style security screening as they entered St Peter’s Square. Police armed with machine guns discreetly patrolled the area. Security around the Vatican has stepped up since the terrorist attacks in Paris last month. At the end of a year in which more than a million people have sought sanctuary in Europe, Francis asked God to “repay all those, both individuals and states, who generously work to provide assistance and welcome to the numerous migrants and refugees”. The pope called for “encouragement … to all those fleeing extreme poverty or war, travelling all too often in inhumane conditions and not infrequently at the risk of their lives”. He praised those who are helping migrants “to build a dignified future for themselves and for their dear ones, and to be integrated in the societies which receive them”. A refugee's journey, part 2: After risking everything to reach Europe, what next? Read more The year has been dominated by images of the exodus from Syria, with refugees risking their lives in search of safety, crossing seas and trudging across Europe. Germany has seen the largest number of asylum applications in Europe. The UK has pledged to accept 20,000 people over five years from refugee camps in countries bordering Syria; the first 1,000 arrived before Christmas. Francis said he hoped recent UN initiatives would end the conflicts in Syria and Libya: “May the attention of the international community be unanimously directed to ending the atrocities which in those countries, as well as in Iraq, Libya, Yemen and sub-Saharan Africa, even now reap numerous victims, cause immense suffering and do not even spare the historical and cultural patrimony of entire peoples.” In the UK, the archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, said an Islamic State “apocalypse” has left Christianity facing “elimination” in the very region where the faith was born two millennia ago. In his Christmas Day sermon in Canterbury cathedral, Welby described the Islamic extremists as “a Herod of today”, referring to the despotic king of Judea at the time of Jesus’s birth. Isis, he said, was “igniting a trail of fear, violence, hatred and determined oppression”. He told the congregation: “Confident that these are the last days, using force and indescribable cruelty, [Isis] seem to welcome all opposition, certain that the warfare unleashed confirms that these are indeed the end times. “They hate difference, whether it is Muslims who think differently, Yazidis or Christians, and because of them the Christians face elimination in the very region in which Christian faith began. “This apocalypse is defined by themselves and heralded only by the angel of death.” Cardinal Vincent Nichols, the archbishop of Westminster and the leader of the Catholic church in England, focused part of his Christmas homily on “gratuitous violence” in the home and the suffering of persecuted Christians around the world. One of the lessons of the nativity was that “in the crib there is absolutely no place for gratuitous violence. In the presence of a child we should always watch our tongues and behaviour, for childhood lessons of anger and violence are never forgotten”, he said. The cardinal drew a link between domestic violence and violence committed in the name of religion. “Let us be resolved to lay aside our own tendencies to angry violence so that we may condemn, with integrity, those who perpetrate such violence and claim for it the name of God.”",diasaster:0},

Rumour has it that Our Town has been performed somewhere in the US every night since its premiere – anyway, a lot. I imagined that it would be some kind of Norman Rockwell painting rendered into a theatre piece, a soothing and attractive idealisation, probably quite dated. Instead, I discovered that it was a masterpiece, as fresh and radical as the day it was written, and as profound and accessible a meditation on the human condition as anyone has ever created. It’s impossible to say quite why this is without giving away the ending, and I don’t want to do that, because everyone should see this play at least once in their lives. I think very often about the production I saw, and sometimes find myself in tears at the wonder of life and at how terribly so many people damage and deface it.

{ "title":"Ambulance services close to breaking point as year’s busiest night approaches", "content": "Ambulance services in England are stretched close to breaking point with three of the country’s 10 ambulance trusts declaring themselves under intense pressure over the Christmas period. High levels of demand forced the three ambulance services to rate themselves as reaching a “critical” state, just one short of the “potential service failure” ranking on a six-point scale measuring the pressures they face. London and Yorkshire have been at critical status for more than two weeks. South Western moved to critical for a brief period from Saturday afternoon to Sunday night, calling in an extra 45 volunteer staff to help cope with demand. Other trusts are at “severe pressure” status – the next level down – but even on this level, East of England said that weekend calls to the service were up by 25% on last year. The staffing pressures are emerging as the ambulance service braces itself for the fallout of New Year’s Eve celebrations, which traditionally give the NHS’s emergency services their busiest night of the year. The head of the British Medical Association said patients were suffering as the NHS’s emergency and urgent care system struggled to cope. Mark Porter, council chair of the doctors’ body, said: “It’s clear to see the whole system is now under immense pressure. GP services are struggling to keep up with the number of patients coming through the door, ambulance services are stretched close to breaking point and hospitals are so full that patients don’t always receive appropriate treatment in an appropriate place within them.” Porter added:“These figures show that the system is operating in a constant state of crisis, running just to stand still – there is no spare capacity to deal with a seasonal spike in demand and patients are suffering.” The grim picture suggests next week’s update on emergency admissions to hospitals and on A&E visits, taking in the Christmas and New Year period, will offer little respite for ministers over the NHS’s financial troubles as May’s general election looms. Before Christmas, the government indicated it had put on hold proposals from ambulance chiefs to change some response times to emergency calls relating to serious, but not the most life-threatening, conditions. Yorkshire ambulance service said there had been an almost 30% rise in incidents involving the most seriously ill or injured over the weekend compared with last year. In south-west England incidents involving the ambulance service on Saturday were 38% up on the same weekend last year and 22% up on Sunday. London ambulance service said the number of patients attended in a serious or life-threatening condition had so far this month increased by 12% on 2013. The service said it was planning big increases to its 3,056 staff to cope with the rise in demand. “Every year demand increases and, in addition to this, we’re facing a shortage of paramedics in the UK which makes recruitment challenging,” a spokesperson said. “We will continue to prioritise our response to our seriously ill and injured patients but other people, with less serious injuries and illnesses, should use NHS 111 or make their own way to hospital.” David Macklin, executive director of operations at Yorkshire ambulance service, said staff and volunteers had worked beyond their normal hours, often without breaks, in order to cope. “We have had to strictly prioritise our calls to ensure that the people who most needed our help received it,” he said. “This has meant that some people have not got the response they expected or wanted but I am sure they will understand that patients with life-threatening illnesses and serious injuries should be cared for first, “While we do not want to deter people from calling 999 in serious cases such as heart attack, breathing difficulties or stroke, we do need people to think very carefully about their options and consider whether they really need an ambulance or whether there is another option available to them.” Clifford Mann, president of the College of Emergency Medicine, said the NHS 111 telephone advice service was sending an ambulance to take a patient to hospital too often because local out-of-hospital medical services, such as visits from a GP or district nurse, were too often inadequate. Mann, a senior emergency care consultant at Musgrove Park hospital in Taunton, Somerset, said the South Western ambulance service had introduced over the weekend “a policy which means that they now won’t wait with the patient [in the back of an ambulance outside an A&E unit] after 30 minutes – that is, the ambulance crew will leave the patient with the hospital staff and go to attend another call. That was the first time that policy has been used at my hospital and it was triggered by the pressure of demand.” NHS England insisted that it was “pulling out all the stops” to ensure that patients received care when and where they needed it.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Heroes of 2014: Pope Francis", "content": "You don’t have to be a believer to recognise that the leader of a billion Catholics has emerged as a global champion of social justice. That’s something of a turnaround both for the Vatican hierarchy – and an Argentinian pope whose record under his country’s dictatorship was less than heroic. But Pope Francis is making up for lost time: denouncing capitalism and the “tyranny” of the market, condemning inequality as the “root of social evil”, rejecting Islamophobia and western warmaking – and even claiming communists are closet Christians who “have stolen our flag”. Add to that his rejection of Vatican pomp, purge of the curia and attempts to soften dogma on everything from sexuality to contraception, and no wonder the conservative backlash is in full swing. A couple of months back the pope told a visiting Latin American social movement leader he would eat only in the Vatican canteen. Was that to demonstrate his common touch? the activist asked. Not at all, the pope replied. He just didn’t trust what they might serve him in the papal apartments. Given Vatican history, he has reason enough to be wary – and both Catholics and non-Catholics have reason to hope he sees off his forces of darkness.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Heroes of 2014: Tony Benn", "content": "For around five years, centring on the 1981 deputy leadership campaign that he came to regret, Tony Benn was bad news for Labour’s prospects. So weirdly raw are the wounds of these years, that when he died in March, the party’s older loyalists allowed this shadow to black out his other 55 years in public life, all of it documented in a crisply written diary, in which personal warmth and private doubt complement the public certainties. On its own, this longevity marks him out as a remarkable figure; combined with the record, it made him a giant. Between first-class stamps, state revenues from north sea oil and (less happily) Concorde, he left more of a legacy than most as a minister. But the most enduring mark was as a parliamentarian. By renouncing his peerages and instigating the Common Market referendum, he changed the British constitution twice. On the green benches and at rallies, he spoke with an arresting clarity. When his eloquence airbrushed away the thorny dilemmas of political life it could be infuriating. But from Northern Ireland and gay rights to the Bush-Blair wars and the feral tendencies of unfettered capitalism, he was right just as often as wrong.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Thousands left homeless by shortage of legal aid lawyers, say charities", "content": "Thousands of people are being made homeless every year because they cannot find lawyers to help them resist eviction, charities are warning. Even though legal aid is available to help anyone in danger of losing their home, there has been an 18% decline in the number of challenges brought, at a time of record repossessions in the private rental market. The latest figures, highlighted by the Legal Action Group (LAG) and the homeless charity Shelter, reinforce warnings by the Law Society that “advice deserts”, where few, if any, lawyers are left in practice who are capable of dealing with legal aid housing cases, are emerging across England and Wales. ‘Shocking’ rise in number of homeless children in B&Bs at Christmas Read more Last year, 42,728 households in rented accommodation were forcibly removed, according to Ministry of Justice figures. That number has risen by 53% since 2010 and now stands at an all-time high. Deep cuts to other forms of housing legal aid introduced by the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders (LASPO) Act 2012, bureaucratic obstructions and poor hourly rates have progressively driven most lawyers specialising in housing out of the market, leaving few practitioners. “People on low incomes facing homelessness and eviction are struggling to get the local face-to-face advice they desperately need and are entitled to by law,” the LAG’s latest report says. The 18% decrease, recorded in official MoJ figures, is in the three months of April to June this year compared with the same quarter the previous year. There are some areas of the country, such as Suffolk and Shropshire, where there is no housing legal aid expert operating at all, the LAG points out. “Too often, lack of any early intervention funding not only ties [lawyers’] hands, but makes it impossible to either identify clients for whom a ‘stitch in time’ might work, or deliver the outcomes that can help to avoid litigation.” One housing solicitor said: “It’s impossible to separate the cuts to legal aid from the cuts to the benefits system. The bedroom tax and Atos disability reassessments all feed into problems we deal with, such as homelessness. Because we can’t do benefits work any more, it’s harder for us to nip problems in the bud. We’re forced to take action at a much later stage, which will ultimately cost the government a lot more.” Steve Hynes, the LAG’s director, told the Guardian: “Due to civil legal aid and other spending cuts, people with common civil legal problems such as difficulties paying the rent or claiming benefits have nowhere to turn. “The reduction in civil legal aid services has gone beyond what the government originally intended. Civil legal aid services are in freefall, with solicitor firms and advice agencies closing. “The government need to use the recently announced review of the LASPO Act to rethink providing early advice in cases, as too often help is only given when costly court-based solutions are the only option.” The number of all legal aid advice cases has dropped by 75% following the LASPO cuts in April 2013 and is continuing to fall. Rough sleeping on rise in Birmingham after cuts to homelessness services Read more John Gallagher, principal solicitor at the homelessness charity Shelter, said: “We have housing officers in 17 locations across the country and some of them are the only source of legal assistance in their areas. “In many areas there are only two or three providers of legal help. Some problems are, at root, to do with benefits but we can only claim for work on repossessions.” Gallagher said there was a large amount of “unmet need” with claimants who are technically “in scope” – entitled to receive legal aid – but who cannot find specialist lawyers to help them with their cases. Thousands of people in such a situation are probably losing their homes every year, he said. Lawyers who work on housing legal aid cases are paid at the rate of £57 an hour, rising to £63 if they appear in court. “That may not initially sound a bad return,” Gallagher explained. “But it has not gone up for 15 or 20 years and lawyers have to pay all their overheads. It’s just not viable in some places.” The Legal Aid Agency has made the process of obtaining funding increasingly complex and difficult, Gallagher added. “There are people who because of want of legal representation lose their homes because they don’t know what to say in court.” The Law Society, which represents solicitors across England and Wales, has campaigned to raise awareness of the advice deserts. Earlier this summer Catherine Dixon, the organisation’s chief executive, warned: “Advice on housing is vital for people who are facing eviction, the homeless and those renting a property in serious disrepair. Early legal advice on housing matters can make the difference between a family being made homeless or not. “People who require legal aid advice for housing issues often need it urgently,” she said. “Families are unable to access justice because they cannot afford to travel to see the one provider in their area who may be located long distances from where they live.” A Ministry of Justice spokesman said: “We have a world-leading legal system, and last year spent more than £1.5bn on legal aid. “We must ensure legal aid is sustainable and fair - both for those who need it and the taxpayer who pays for it. That is why we have made sure support remains available to the most vulnerable and in the most serious cases. “We have committed to carrying out a post-implementation review of the civil legal aid changes and an announcement on this will be made in due course.”",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Mark Hamill: ‘Part of the fun is escaping the drudgery of real life’", "content": "Being the hero of a blockbuster entertainment franchise, you might expect Mark Hamill to be far removed from the sort of merchandise-obsessed fans who probably own five different plastic re-creations of his lightsaber-wielding Jedi, Luke Skywalker – all of course still in their original packaging. But as it turns out, Hamill is, and always has been, one of them. He now looks more like Obi-Wan than Luke thanks to the greying hair and beard, but in his new web-based docu-series Pop Culture Quest we see the happy hoarder of toys, comics and other assorted geekery Hamill has been for decades. Hamill’s show – on the subscription streaming service launched by uber-fan gathering Comic-Con this year – finds him probing a different kind of galaxy. It’s one populated by aficionados of popular culture who, like him, seek out all kinds of oddball prizes from rare monster toys to pinball machines. In it Hamill seeks out and chats with those collectors. They’re as idiosyncratic a set of characters as you’d find in a Mos Eisley cantina, yet there’s also something compelling in the interaction between them and Hamill as he explores the motivations behind their obsessions. That goes for the star host too, some of whose prized possessions include comics he keeps in storage, a prototype of the original unused Chewbacca mask that George Lucas didn’t like and decided to let Hamill keep, and Beatles model kits that Hamill has never opened. Pop Culture Quest is a look at the nature of fandom and, as Hamill tells the Guardian, the escapism it provides.. “Part of the fun of all this is escaping the drudgery of real life,” Hamill says. “Whether you’re having a difficult time at work or you’re not achieving career goals – there’s things that make you personally happy. And collecting is a way to sort of express your personality. To show appreciation for the things that you value. “In a way, I’m in a really trivial business. I have a brother who’s a doctor, and to me that’s something that’s a really tangible skill that helps people. But he was saying to me, you know, that entertainment and diversion is really important for people’s wellbeing overall. They need that escape mechanism from how harsh life can be.” Facebook Twitter Pinterest Mark Hamill, left, as Luke Skywalker during the filming of the first Star Wars movie. Photograph: Allstar/Lucasfilm Pop Culture Quest is many things in one. It might be a celebration of frivolity, yet there’s also a subtext of innocence and even melancholy – of a natural urge to chase the illusion of permanence. The movie ended, the TV show was eventually cancelled, the hero got the girl, but by collecting the mementoes and trinkets, in a way the show doesn’t end. It’s a common language, pop fandom; a thing to pass down. Mapping the topography of a person’s life invariably meanders to their diversions and individual tastes. We are the things we love. And of course, a lot of people love Star Wars. “I don’t take it for granted,” Hamill says about the passion of Star Wars fans. “In this business, you want to make people happy. And the fact so many people get such joy out of it and pass it on to their children – to be a part of people’s lives like that is something I’ll always be grateful for.” Speaking a few days before the franchise’s latest instalment Rogue One hits cinemas, Hamill admits to not knowing as much about it as fans might expect, but he shares their anticipation. “What I think is exciting about the standalone films is since they don’t have to follow that three-act structure of a trilogy, they can really get in, establish the story, and get out and leave you wanting more,” Hamill says. “And each standalone film can have its own identity. “[Rogue One] looks like a gritty second world war film, in a way. It looks hyper-realistic. When they do the young Han Solo film, he’s a rogue and a womaniser, and it could be much more of a comedic thing. The swashbuckling rogue. But that’s what’s exciting about the standalone films. They can be vastly different in style and still within the Star Wars universe.” Next year’s various Comic Con events around the world, which will attract hordes of fans dressed as their favourite sci-fi or fantasy characters, will almost certainly see its fair share of outfits inspired by Rogue One. But Hamill’s show and the new streaming service it airs on – called Comic Con HQ – are part of an attempt to tap into that fandom on a more regular basis.. Seth Laderman, the service’s executive vice-president and general manager, says the idea is to make Comic-Con “a year-round situation”, with Pop Culture Quest central to the project. “I asked the guys who created Comic-Con: how did you make this so successful? And they said: ‘We programme an event for us, because we are the fanbase,’” he says. “I think our goal is to try to be a complement to some of these other platforms out there. We’re not trying to compete with Netflix. We’re trying to hit that real passionate audience and programme stuff specifically for them.” Laderman won’t give audience figures but says the response since Comic-Con HQ’s launch in May has been “resoundingly positive”. At the moment, the service is only available in the US via the web, iOS and Android devices, Amazon Channels, Roku and AppleTV. Fans around the world can for now stream individual Comic-Con HQ series on other platforms such as Vimeo. Comic-Con HQ original series are also available for download in select territories via services such as iTunes and Google, and on games consoles. Hamill’s show is an example of what the service wants to offer fans – content programmed for them, that in a way also celebrates them. Not that it’s an easy hill to climb, launching a service into a media landscape chock-a-block with competition. The biggest players such as Netflix and Amazon have deep pockets and reach, and other niche services keep emerging, like the new streaming service BritBox – a partnership between BBC Worldwide and ITV. The answer for Comic-Con HQ is to look for well-known talent such as Hamill and turn them loose. “We’re in a lot of conversations for our next shows right now,” Laderman says. “We’re working with people and brands that have pre-existing audiences attached to them. One of our goals is to allow innovators like Mark the opportunity and platform to create and bring their own ideas to life.” And for Hamill, that idea is straightforward: pop culture is a way for people to gravitate to brands and ideas and tangible things to “communicate through what you love”. Hamill loves, among other things, pinball machines. And he points to one episode of his show that sees him visit a man with a warehouse full of them. The collector can talk about their histories, which ones are rare and valuable. But the joy of the show, Hamill explains, is that you don’t have to be as enthusiastic about pinball machines to appreciate his passion. That appreciation of pop culture and collections is, he says, the “connective tissue behind all the episodes of our show”. And given the number of toy Luke Skywalkers appreciated by fans the world over, it’s a topic he is almost uniquely suited to explore.",diasaster:0},

The BBC sports presenter upset bookmakers’ predictions to waltz off with the glitterball trophy. Oduba and his professional partner, Joanne Clifton, beat former Eternal singer Louise Redknapp and Hollyoaks actor Danny Mac in a finale watched by 13.1 million viewers. The final also marked the last live show of head judge Len Goodman, who is stepping down after 12 years. Strictly Come Dancing ends most popular ever series on ratings high Read more Speaking after the result was announced, Oduba said the victory “doesn’t make any sense”, adding: “I cannot believe it, we did not even consider this [winning], not even for a single week of this.” Former shadow chancellor Ed Balls, whose routines on the show had appalled the judges, captivated the nation and almost saw him reach the quarter-finals, wrote in the Sunday Telegraph that he had expected Redknapp to win. “Going into the final, Louise clearly had the edge. She’d never been in the dance-off and had clearly struck a chord with lots of people around the country,” he wrote. Mac was “definitely banging on the door to win”, Balls added. But Oduba, who had no previous dance experience, had improved the most over the course of the series “and because the show is importantly about the amateur improving, that was Ore’s calling card”. Balls reprised his unforgettable Gangnam Style dance for the finale’s group-dance performance. Ladbrokes ranked Oduba as a 7/1 outsider, writing before the finale that it was a “toss-up between long-time favourite Danny Mac and Louise Redknapp”. But on the night, Oduba and Clifton narrowly beat their rivals, scoring two perfect 40s and dropping a single point for their revisiting of Singing in the Rain, which was watched by Gene Kelly’s widow, Patricia, in the audience.

Photograph: Guy Levy/BBC/PA After the victory, Oduba praised his wife, Portia, for being his “anchor” and described how much it meant to have his parents, who had travelled from Nigeria, in the audience. Oduba said: “She’s supported us so much and just been my absolute anchor, and my mum and dad just being here, they’ve sacrificed so much, both of our parents have sacrificed so much for us in our lives, so for them to be here and see this, the most unexpected moment of my life, is just incredible.” Oduba said he was looking forward to Christmas and planned to take a two-week holiday. He will return to sports presenting but intends to dance for the rest of his life. “I can’t think of a time when I will not be dancing now. It’s just, it is in me now, I can’t not dance,” he said. Clifton paid tribute to her older brother Kevin, who partnered Redknapp in his fourth final but has yet to win the trophy. “I just said sorry to him because he’s made four finals and he’s never won it yet,” she said, adding: “I was away from my family for 14 years living in Italy and I didn’t see him that much and since I’ve come back, he’s been a big brother to me again.” Oduba said he was looking forward to reuniting with the cast for the Strictly tour, which starts in Birmingham next month. “We don’t get to see the fans who’ve been so supportive of us on this journey so to be able to go out and show it to people in January through to March will be amazing because they love this show,” he said. Oduba added: “Len will be there, we’re going to give him another swan song, it’s going to be exceptional and I can’t wait.”",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"GCHQ asked to step up action against cyber-attack threat to financial services", "content": "More action may be needed to protect the financial services industry from a devastating cyber-attack, the head of the Treasure select committee has suggested. Andrew Tyrie MP wrote to Ciaran Martin, head of the new cybersecurity centre of UK surveillance agency GCHQ, saying the lines of responsibility and accountability for reducing cyber-threats are opaque. Tyrie’s letter to Martin, who is leading the Cheltenham-based National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), uses last month’s incident at Tesco Bank to illustrate the vulnerabilities of the financial system. In November, the banking arm of supermarket chain Tesco admitted that £2.5m had been stolen from 9,000 accounts in an incident which raised fresh concerns about the methods used by financial services firms to detect cyber-attacks. Two-thirds of all major UK companies – not just financial services firms – have reported security breaches in the last year. The Bank of England has also listed the threat of cyber-attacks as one of the major risks facing the financial services industry. In his letter Tyrie, a Conservative MP, outlines the responsibility for cyber-threats as being shared between the Bank’s Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA), the Financial Conduct Authority and GCHQ. In turn, the regulatory arms are responsible to the Treasury, while GCHQ reports through the foreign secretary. Cyber-attacks and hacking: what you need to know Read more In light of this, Tyrie said: “It is for consideration whether a single point of responsibility for cyber risk in the financial services sector, with full ownership of – and accountability for – financial cyber-threats is now required. It may be necessary to create a line of accountability to the Treasury for financial cybercrime.” Tyrie also asks Martin for clarity on the objectives of NCSC, which was set up two months ago to take charge of the UK’s defences against cyber-offences. “Legacy systems, human error and deliberate attack have resulted in unacceptable interruptions to vital banking services and weakened the public’s confidence in the banking system as a whole. The recent attack on Tesco Bank is only the latest example of criminals exploiting vulnerabilities in the banking industry’s IT systems,” said Tyrie. A spokesman for the NCSC said: “We have received this letter and there will be a government response in the New Year.” TalkTalk hit with record £400k fine over cyber-attack Read more The parliamentary committee has been asking questions about the need for a clearer command structure to tackle cyber-attacks during its evidence sessions. Last week, Sam Woods, the Bank’s deputy governor who runs PRA, was asked his views on the need for a single point of contact. Woods replied it was important to know which body was in charge of each incident rather than have the same point of contact. “It is essential that the intelligence community gives the regulators the technical and practical support they need to do their job. This means making sure that financial cybercrime has a high priority, and is not subordinate to other work,” said Tyrie. “Certainly, as millions of customers are exposed to the risks of cybercrime, a higher level of scrutiny and accountability for existing arrangements is needed,” he added.",diasaster:0},

{ "title":"A refugee's journey, part 2: After risking everything to reach Europe, what next?", "content": "Hashem al-Souki is sitting in the little public library in Skinnskatteberg when he hears the bad news. It’s been six months since he arrived in Sweden, six months of purgatory – and he’s still waiting to find out if he has been granted asylum. Spring turned to summer, and now winter is almost here. With every passing day, he wonders more and more whether something that was supposed to be a formality will instead never come. His fears appear to be confirmed. The Journey: A refugee's odyssey from Syria to Sweden Read more Hashem comes to this library a few times a week, for want of something better to do. This afternoon he sits down and starts scrolling through Facebook. There are the familiar posts about what’s going on in Syria. And then there’s one that makes him want to cry. Sweden’s political parties, someone has written, have collectively agreed to stop giving permanent asylum to Syrians, with the exception of those who have come as a family. And for the men who haven’t, the post claims, there are to be restrictions on their right to family reunification. His head starts to spin. If this is true, everything he’s prayed for over the past six months has come to nothing. He is safe. But his family, alone and afraid on the other side of the Mediterranean, are not. And now they never may be. This was not the limbo that Hashem had in mind when he left Syria two-and-a-half years ago. The Syrian regime had tortured him inside their jails, destroyed his home, and forced him to move from town to town to escape their bombs. So in June 2013 he escaped to Egypt with his wife, Hayam, and their three young boys, Osama, Mohamed and Milad – all of them seeking some semblance of stability. But in post-revolutionary Egypt, stability was hard to find, so in April 2015 Hashem left in a smugglers’ boat for Italy. A fortnight later he reached Sweden, after an epic journey retold in the Guardian this June. He had hoped to win asylum and then apply for his family to join him. But today in the library all that seems impossible. map “Unfortunately,” he despairs in a message he sends a friend that day, “my dreams have crashed.” Six months earlier, it is 29 April. Hashem has just arrived in southern Sweden and things are so much brighter. As dawn breaks, he takes a train northwards and spends the night with Ehsan, his brother-in-law. Ehsan arrived here as a refugee last summer, and Hashem hasn’t seen him for two years. The next day Ehsan puts him on the train to Gävle, the nearest town with an office for Migrationsverket, Sweden’s migration agency. “Hello,” Hashem says to the security guard when he gets there. “I’m Syrian. I’m a refugee.” The security guard smiles. “Welcome,” he says, and takes Hashem to a receptionist. She writes down his details, gives him a key, and shows him to a bedroom upstairs in the centre. For perhaps the first time in his life, he feels like a government is treating him as a human. Hashem spends the weekend in Gävle, and on the Tuesday he is told to board a bus that will take him to his permanent lodgings. The bus cruises serenely through the Swedish countryside, past fields and lakes, and through tall forests. Hashem marvels at the calmness of it all, the lack of traffic, the greenery. It’s different from anything he has experienced before – and so is the village they reach, a couple of hours later. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Skinnskatteberg ... a tiny, remote place of 4,000 residents, 100 miles north-west of Stockholm. Photograph: Patrick Kingsley for the Guardian This is Skinnskatteberg, a tiny, remote place of just 4,000 residents, 90 miles south-west of Gävle, and 100 miles north-west of Stockholm. It’s not somewhere you would usually want to billet 70 frightened foreigners. But such is the flow of refugees to Sweden that the authorities are struggling to find places to house the newest arrivals. This makeshift centre – a disused hotel – in Skinnskatteberg is the best they could find for Hashem and his cohort. His first reaction is that it’s quite pleasant. There is a little lawn outside with some chairs. Behind the building is a pretty wood. It’s on a gentle slope, so if you stand outside the door, and stroll a few paces, there is a pleasing view of the village and the spire of its white church. Inside, however, a shock is waiting. Since being tortured inside Assad’s prisons, Hashem has suffered from some of the symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). He tries to explain this in Arabic to the Migrationsverket staff as his condition will require specific kinds of treatment. But without an interpreter, they don’t understand him, and he’s too embarrassed to try to explain further. Soon they leave, and they won’t be back for another week. Migrationsverket officials are so stretched that they visit the centre only on a Tuesday, between 1pm and 2pm. For the rest of the time, the residents are on their own. Still, at least Hashem has somewhere to live. At least he’s in Sweden. And at least the village is pleasant. He’s impressed by the church. He discovers a lake at the southern end of the town, and enjoys strolling around it. He is happily astonished at the absence of police or soldiers on the streets, and at the fact he never hears any fighter jets overhead. He could not be further from Syria – or Egypt for that matter. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Hashem al-Souki outside the church in Skinnskatteberg, Sweden. Photograph: Patrick Kingsley for the Guardian Tuesday comes round again, and with it the chance to tell the migration agency about his problem. The allotted hour arrives, and Hashem turns up to the dining room to make his case. Again, there are no interpreters. Again, he tries to explain his situation. But again, no one understands him. Embarrassed, he heads back to his dormitory. The same thing happens the next week – and the week after. It’s a miserable situation. He’s escaped from the hell of Syria and Egypt. Unfortunately, Sweden so far offers him only purgatory – and it’s only on the fourth week that he is able to explain his predicament properly. Back in Egypt, his wife and their sons Osama, Mohamed and Milad are also in limbo. First off, they have now lost their primary sources of income. Hashem can no longer put money on the table. There’s no work in Skinnskatteberg, and besides, he can’t yet speak Swedish. The UN refugee agency has cut its funding too. His wife finds work as an Arabic teacher at a school for Syrian children, but the meagre wages don’t cover the family’s living expenses. The hardest part, though, isn’t the poverty, but the sense of social exclusion. As Syrians, life is tough in Egypt. The xenophobia has dropped since its peak in 2013, but they still feel like social outcasts. And without Hashem they are wary of leaving the house for too long. Hashem’s own misery somewhat lifts once the Migrationsverket staff grasp the nature of his condition and move him to a private room. Now his main problems are the boredom and the loneliness. His asylum interview will be in late August, and until then he is counting down the days. There’s a rock by the lake that he walks to every day, and where he establishes a new daily ritual. He sits on it for several minutes and gazes out across the water, contemplating life. Times goes so slowly – until one day some of the villagers begin Swedish classes in the church hall. It isn’t a government project – it’s just something that half a dozen pensioners have decided to do by themselves. Hashem’s teachers, Kerstin and Eva, have never taught English before so the classes have a rambling quality. But they’re about so much more than just the language. “It’s about the connection!” says Hashem after one class ends. He gets to make friends with real Swedes, and those Swedes, some of whom are a bit lonely themselves, get something out of it too. In particular, Hashem warms to Kerstin, a frail widow who lives alone in a wooden cottage out in the woods. She gets him to fix her computer and a bond is formed, leading to him regularly stopping by for tea after class. Her house is unlike any he’s previously been to. In one room, she has a giant weaver’s loom. In another there’s a table built from parts first carved in 1623, a lampshade made from the wheel of a cart, and green wallpaper full of clover leaves. It’s an unusual home – but one of the first in Sweden in which Hashem has felt properly welcomed.

Photograph: Patrick Kingsley for the Guardian The eve of his interview finally arrives. Hashem’s not nervous – he’s excited. “It’s my day of destiny,” he says to himself. He showers and shaves. He sets his alarm for 6am and asks Ehsan and Hayam to call him to make sure he’s up in time. There’s no need, in the end. He’s up, alert, and early for the 6.45am bus ride to Västerås, the nearest big town. When the bus moves off, he uses the journey to arrange his thoughts, anxious to give the best possible account of himself in the interview. He goes over in his head what happened when he left Syria, and why – and wonders what kinds of questions he will be asked. Souki finds out soon enough. Getting out at Västerås, he meets his caseworker at the migration agency offices. Through an interpreter, she asks him a series of methodical questions over the course of two hours. Where is he from in Syria? What kind of an area is it? What is the situation there? How did the war affect him? Why was he put in prison? Had he ever expressed a political affiliation? Why did he leave? The questions are firm but respectful, and to Hashem the process seems fair. His interrogator has a gentle manner, and Hashem feels relieved. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Hashem al-Souki at Kerstin’s house, the first place where he feels properly welcomed. Photograph: Patrick Kingsley for the Guardian The next day, back in Skinnskatteberg, Hashem starts a new routine. He begins to log on to the Migrationsverket website every morning to see if there has been a decision in his case. He knows it will take a few weeks or so, but he figures it can’t hurt to check. After a month or so, though, it does start to hurt. Each time he logs on, the website shows no change in his status. He checks and checks and checks. Still nothing. And as September turns into October, he starts to worry. Is there something wrong? Did his interviewer not believe him? The general political climate doesn’t help. As autumn wears on, more refugees than ever are arriving in Europe – and thanks to its progressive policies, Sweden continues to bear a disproportionate burden of the crisis. The number of rooms for asylum-seekers is dwindling fast. Opposition politicians call for an end to the open-door policies. Soon the government loses its nerve, promising to stop giving out permanent residencies in 2016 and restrict access to family reunion. It’s this decision that sends Hashem’s head spinning in the library. Will his case be settled in time? Facebook Twitter Pinterest Hashem al-Souki haves coffee after a Swedish class. Photograph: Patrick Kingsley for the Guardian Fearing the worst, he falls into despair. His PTSD symptoms return. He starts to check the Migrationsverket website almost as a reflex. Every day becomes every hour – and every hour brings a new disappointment. He checks the site before breakfast, and there’s nothing. He checks it after breakfast, and there’s still nothing. Before lunch: nothing. After lunch: nothing. One day in October, Hashem heads to the church hall for his Swedish lesson. Before the lesson, again, there’s nothing. During the coffee break, he retrieves his phone from his pocket, types in his code, and again scans his page to find that there’s ... he blinks. He scans the page again. There’s … something. “Application status,” it reads in Arabic. “Your request for residency, permission to work, permission to study, citizenship or asylum has been received.” He scrolls down to the next paragraph. “The Swedish Board of Immigration has taken a decision concerning the granting or refusal of your request.” And then, again, there’s nothing. Nothing that explains whether the decision is positive or negative. Nothing to clarify whether his case is one of the first to be considered under the government’s new restrictive measures – or one of the last under the old order. It just says there’s been a decision. Hashem has to report once more to the Migrationsverket in Västerås to find out whether he has cause for celebration or despair. So two weeks later he finds himself waiting yet again in the darkness at the bus stop at Skinnskatteberg. He sits silently for the duration of the journey, hoping, praying that there will be no more surprises. He has an hour to spare by the time he gets to Västerås, but he still hurries to the Migrationsverket building. He wants to be the first in the queue. He gets his wish – there’s no one else here. He paces around, sits on the chair, stands up again, and goes for a smoke. He returns, and it’s still only 8:30am. His anxiety rises. Why have they taken so long over his application? Has he been rejected? Or are there simply administrative delays? And if the latter, what kind of residency will he get? Permanent? Temporary? If it’s just temporary, he might not be able to apply for family reunion. And that would defeat the whole point. His journey from Egypt, across the Mediterranean and then through Europe, would all have been a waste. Nine o’clock passes – opening time – but still the doors are still shut. A crowd builds behind him. Hashem frowns, his heart beating fast. In a few minutes he should know whether he has a life ahead of him in Sweden.

Hashem takes a ticket from the machine – number 806 – and he’s one of the first to be called into a cubicle. Inside, behind a counter, a sombre woman greets him. She pushes an envelope towards him across the counter. He tears it open and finds a card inside. He looks down at it. It’s Wednesday 10 November 2015. Three years after he left Assad’s jails, two years after he escaped Syria, and seven months after he survived the sea, Hashem finally sees the words he has been waiting for. “Permanent uppehällstillständ,” the card says. “Permanent residency.” Facebook Twitter Pinterest Hashem al-Souki after finding out the status of his asylum application.

{ "title":"How to collect a refund for something you didn't want for Christmas", "content": "After Christmas, one in five gifts ends up at the back of cupboards to collect dust for years to come. Should you try taking them back to the shop for a refund? Retailers are under no obligation to accept returns unless they are faulty, but, luckily, most now provide a “goodwill” returns policy offering an exchange, refund or credit note over the Christmas period. But goodwill policies vary enormously. You’ll struggle to hand back opened cosmetics, pierced earrings or cosmetics and DVDs, CDs and computer games where the seal has been broken. Many retailers require you to return things in their original packaging and some will only offer an exchange or credit note, not a refund. Celebrities’ unwanted Christmas presents: ‘dear Santa, can you take this back?’ Read more The trick is to look out for a gift receipt, which won’t tell you the cost but probably tell you the last date for returns. Marks & Spencer, for example, will give you a full exchange or refund in the form of a credit note if you return something with a gift receipt until 16 January if the item was bought on or after 14 September 2015. If you have no receipt and don’t want to risk hurting the donor’s feelings by asking them for one you can still try taking the item back. A few retailers offer refunds or exchanges without receipts, but only at the most recent price, so if your gift has been reduced in the sale the value of what you get back will be discounted accordingly. M&S offers an exchange or a refund in the form of a credit note to the value of the current selling price on items with no receipt. Similarly, John Lewis will give you a gift card to the value of the current selling price, while Debenhams will give you an exchange. But House of Fraser and TK Maxx will not refund or exchange returns without a receipt. One rather tricky issue with getting refunds is that the seller may only be prepared to return the money on to the card that was used to buy the item, so you are likely to have to settle for a credit note instead. If it was bought online, there are further hurdles; the online retailer will want the despatch note or invoice as proof of purchase. However retail giant Amazon has a returns page which explains how to send back your unwanted presents without the buyer being told. If the gift was sent by Amazon between 1 November, 2015 and 31 December 2015, it may be returned at any time before midnight on 31 January2016. You’ll get a gift voucher minus the return costs once your return has been received and, if you haven’t got one, you need to create your own Amazon account to receive the voucher. According to research by Gocompare, 45% of Brits who have tried to return gifts in the past said they had been unsuccessful. It found that one in 10 people return presents, worth on average £50. Nearly half the people taking goods back simply wanted to swap it for a better fit or colour, but 12% returned a gift because they wanted the cash. An alternative is to let someone benefit from unwanted gifts. Discarded presents are the life blood of charity shops, which welcome most items, though not all can accept electrical or perishable goods. If you know someone who’ love the gift you hate, another solution is to stash it away to give it to them next Christmas or birthday. But note who gave it to you in the first place so you don’t accidentally give it back to them next year.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"The Guardian view on giving ministers a free vote on Europe", "content": "Elasticity is a trait of which politicians do not boast, although the successful ones usually have plenty of it. Fixity of purpose is important but without flexibility nothing would get done. Even Margaret Thatcher, held up by admirers as a paragon of unyielding determination, knew the value of a compromise. Until she forgot it, at which point her downfall began. David Cameron is a different kind of leader, with resolve that is hard to discern amid the blur of tactical wobbles. The steel he has is coated in soft plastic. In some ways, this has served him well. He would not be prime minister if swing voters in marginal seats had not decided that he was an unthreatening family man, who exuded a mild but confident sense of what he was all about – even if all that he was about was being prime minister. That is his brand. To maintain his image and his position, Mr Cameron has often ducked confrontation. This is how he has ended up with the obligation to hold a referendum on Britain’s EU membership, after a renegotiation that diehard sceptics were always going to denounce as a sham. The whole process has been designed to defer civil war in the Conservative party. Mr Cameron celebrated his 10th anniversary as Tory leader this month. Throughout that decade the question of Europe has had the potential to undo him. He has kept that potential from being fulfilled by a combination of opportunistic gambits and tactical retreats. But the price of temporary unity for the party has been the absence of a strategy for the country. And the price keeps going up. The prime minister has managed his own backbenches like a debtor, returning to a pawnbroker every few months, offering some new item to purchase a spell of peace.In the run-up to Christmas, Mr Cameron’s Eurosceptic creditors were pestering him to put another item in hock – the doctrine of collective cabinet responsibility. Exactly how many secretaries of state want to campaign for Brexit is unknown. They can postpone a declaration until the terms of the renegotiation are settled (and therein lies much of its utility as a device for party management). The “leave” camp believes its cause would be boosted with big-hitters if the cabinet were given a free vote. On their side is the precedent of 1975, when Harold Wilson abandoned thoughts of whipping his divided government behind membership of the EEC. The counter-view is that the renegotiation is a central pillar of government policy and so ministers who reject it should, by force of protocol and conscience, resign from the government. Mr Cameron looks certain to yield on this point. Refusing a procedural concession to the sceptics would be out of character. Besides, cabinet unity will not be the decisive factor in the vote and the prime minister will be keen to manage the campaign in a way that maximises the chances of putting his party back together again after polling day. That points to a free vote for the frontbench. The hope inside Downing Street is that a deal with EU partners can be done early in 2016, with a referendum late in spring, before a seasonally predictable migration surge over the summer. Televised refugee chaos, it is feared, would persuade more voters that the question on the ballot paper was really a choice between porous and closed borders, with leaving the EU cast as the safer bet. In reality, Britain will have to cooperate with its continental neighbours on migration, as on so many other questions, whether it is in or out of the EU. But staying in makes for a more effective collaboration; a seat at the top table. The border cannot be sealed and there is no economic, cultural or strategic merit in pretending it should be. This may not be the simplest argument in the debate but it is an important one that many Conservatives, even those of Eurosceptic disposition, including the prime minister, grasp. Soon Mr Cameron will have to make the case for Britain’s continued engagement with the European project, which is not the same as doing a quickie sales job on his renegotiation. The deal he strikes is born of expediency for the Conservative party; the EU question itself is of historic importance for the country. He can claim that the two work in tandem; that renegotiated terms renew the strategic imperative. Up to a point they will. But the two aspects of the prime minister’s position come from different sides of his political personality – his resolve in wanting to keep Britain in Europe and plasticity in the way he has pursued that ambition. It is time for Mr Cameron to show more steel.",diasaster:0},

{ "title":"Senior Republican Steve Scalise spoke at white supremacist meeting in 2002", "content": "The new Republican-controlled Congress risks becoming engulfed in a growing race scandal after it emerged that House majority whip Steve Scalise spoke at a white supremacist conference backed by former Klu Klux Klan leader David Duke. In his first public comments since the allegations emerged in a blog on Sunday, Scalise appeared to acknowledge on Monday night that he probably attended the 2002 event outside New Orleans, though he insisted he had no specific memory of it and sought to distance himself from the views of those present. “I didn’t know who all of these groups were and I detest any kind of hate group,” the Louisiana congressman told the Times-Picayune newspaper. “I had one person that was working for me. When someone called and asked me to speak, I would go. I was, in no way, affiliated with that group or the other groups I was talking to,” he added. Any lingering doubt over Scalise’s links to the conference was further diminished however by Duke, who separately told a Washington Post reporter that the then Louisiana state politician was invited as a speaker by two of his close associates, Howie Farrell and Kenny Knight. Scalise’s spokeswoman, Moira Bagley, told the Guardian: “We have no reason to believe he was not there. It is 99% likely that he was there, but we have no direct records so cannot confirm for definite.” The group that organised the conference, called the European-American Unity and Rights Organization (Euro), is ostensibly aimed at promoting the “civil rights” of white Americans but anti-racism campaigners claim it is primarily a vehicle to promote the far-right writings of Duke, a former KKK grand wizard. The politically toxic link emerges just days before the new Congress is sworn in and was further compounded for Republicans on Monday night by separate news that New York congressman Michael Grimm has decided to resign in the wake of pleading guilty to tax fraud. Support for Scalise, the third highest-ranking House Republican and one of the most senior conservatives in Washington, was noticeably absent on Monday despite his attempt to distance himself from Duke. Louisiana governor Bobby Jindall, one of the few non-white figures in the party, backed Scalise in a statement that said he was a “good man who is fair-minded and kind-hearted”, but few of the party’s senior leaders in Washington were yet willing to defend him. Neither the House speaker, John Boehner, the majority leader, Kevin McCarthy, nor the Republican National Convention responded to requests for comment from the Guardian, and the revelations may put intense pressure on Scalise, who won a fiercely-fought whip election in June as a Tea Party-backed candidate but is often at odds with Republican leadership. Some experienced figures on the Hill believe he will survive the revelations, however, arguing that an isolated incident six years before joining Congress will not stick without a pattern of similar behaviour. “This looks to me like an incident where a politician was at the wrong place at the wrong time by accident,” Tom Cole, the party’s deputy majority whip, told the Guardian. “As a Native American I am pretty sensitive to charges of racism and white supremacy,” the Oklahoma congressman added. “I have never seen any evidence that Steve holds such views. Quite the contrary ... I do not believe he has a racist bone in his body.” Scalise’s best hope of political salvation seems to lie in his claims that he was unaware of the group’s history and was poorly advised due to a lack of staff at the time. “Throughout his career in public service, Mr Scalise has spoken to hundreds of different groups with a broad range of viewpoints,” Bagley said in a statement from Scalise’s DC office. “In every case, he was building support for his policies, not the other way around. In 2002, he made himself available to anyone who wanted to hear his proposal to eliminate slush funds that wasted millions of taxpayer dollars as well as his opposition to a proposed tax increase on middle class families.” “He has never been affiliated with the abhorrent group in question,” she added. “The hate-fueled ignorance and intolerance that group projects is in stark contradiction to what Mr Scalise believes and practices as a father, a husband, and a devoted Catholic.” Nonetheless, Scalise confirmed in his subsequent Times-Picayune interview that he was aware of Duke – who is said to have addressed the conference by video-link – and it has been reported that the hotel that hosted the event was concerned enough to rebuke the group after it found out their politics. The claims that Scalise was an “honoured guest” were first made by a Louisiana blogger, Lamar White, who unearthed evidence of Scalise’s participation in the event on a far-right website called Stormfront. Duke is perhaps the most well-known white supremacist in America, and was briefly also a Louisiana state representative in the early 1990s after switching his party allegiance from Democrat to Republican. Asked if he was concerned about the impact the alleged links would have on his job as House majority whip, Scalise, replied: “At the end of the day, you are judged by your character.”",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Gambian soldiers attempt coup while president is abroad", "content": "A group of disaffected soldiers launched a foiled coup bid in the Gambia on Tuesday while the president was abroad, military and diplomatic sources said. Forces loyal to President Yahya Jammeh, who has ruled the west African country for 20 years, killed three suspects including the alleged ringleader – an army deserter, a military officer said. The officer, speaking from Bissau, said the deserter – named as Lamin Sanneh – led a heavily-armed attack with six men on the presidential palace in the capital Banjul. The pre-dawn assault triggered panic in Bissau, while national radio went off air for several hours and state television was suspended. Jammeh’s precise whereabouts remained unclear. Gambian officials said the president was on a private visit to Dubai and foreign diplomats said he was in France, but an official in Paris said there was no sign he was in the country. Opposition politician Sheikh Sidya Bayo told a private Senegalese radio station that the unrest was “the start of a mutiny that changed” into a bid to topple Jammeh. Three of the suspected coup plotters were killed and another captured by Jammeh’s forces, but there was no confirmation of an overall death toll from the fighting. “Police and the army are now entirely in control of the situation,” the military officer said. A Gambian diplomat said the presidential palace in the heart of the small city on the Gambia river was attacked at about 3am by armed men, including members of the presidential guard. “They wanted to overthrow the regime,” a military source told AFP, while a western diplomat said a coup attempt had apparently been foiled. Army patrols urged people to return home and remain calm. Jammeh, 49, the former head of military police, has ruled the largely rural country of 1.8 million people with a firm hand since 1994, when he came to power in a coup that toppled founding leader Sir Dawda Jawara. Backed by his Alliance for Patriotic Reorientation and Reconstruction (APRC) party, which enjoys a large majority in parliament, Jammeh has come under fire for human rights abuses, including the disappearance of his foes Jammeh has denounced gay people, once threatening to behead them but instead overseeing the imposition of long jail terms.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Next emerges as a Christmas winner", "content": "Next is handing its shareholders a special dividend payout after the December cold snap delivered a late rush of Christmas shoppers to its doors. The retailer said sales were up 2.9% in the two months to Christmas Eve, which was at the top end of revised sales guidance provided by the company when it issued a profit warning in October. Investors welcomed the news, with its shares rising the most in the FTSE 100, gaining more than 3% to £67.25. “Christmas was definitely back-ended,” said Next chief executive Simon Wolfson. “Part of the reason was the weather was so clement all through November that Christmas almost took people by surprise when it came. As soon as the weather turned cold [at November’s end] we saw our sales move back in line with expectations.” Sales at Next stores edged up 0.5% during the period, while sales at its Directory home shopping business were up 7.5%, reflecting the growth of buying gifts online. The retailer also enjoyed a strong closing week as Britons flocked to its shops to buy presents in the last few days before Christmas. “It looks like a last-minute pre-Christmas rush and the strength of Directory saved Next from the impact of all the recent high street discounting,” said independent retail analyst Nick Bubb, who referred to the retailer’s weekly sales graph, which showed that after a difficult November, every week in December was up on the previous year – “culminating in a huge last-minute rush”. Next is one of the few retailers that does not run promotions before Christmas and, despite the success of one-day events such as Black Friday, Wolfson said he saw no reason to alter its full-price trading stance. “It is what it is,” he said of the raft of pre-Christmas sales. “We just have to make sure our budgets and forecasts are relevant in the context of that environment.” Its stores and home shopping arm had a “very good day” on Black Friday despite the absence of discounts, he added. Given the widespread use of price cuts to attract shoppers, Wolfson said it was impossible to say how Next had fared against competitors because “so much volume was driven by discounting”. Conlumino analyst Neil Saunders said Next’s performance was “solid”, given it was an increase on strong figures a year ago, adding: “The figures are a vindication of Next’s refusal to engage in pre-Christmas discounting. “While this may have cost Next some sales growth over the reported sales period, we believe that it has not lost it much, if anything, in terms of profits. Indeed, this is reflected in the profit guidance, which is some £5m ahead of where it was in October.” Saunders said Next’s figures reflected the wider trend over Christmas, with retailers’ sales bolstered by online stores and services such as click and collect. Next, which was forced to lower its sales and profits guidance after the warm autumn weather hit demand for its winter clothing ranges, said significantly more stock had gone into its end-of-season sale, with clearance rates in line with its expectations. It now expects full-year profits to be between £765m and £785m. Wolfson also struck a positive tone about the coming year. He said: “The economic outlook for the UK consumer looks relatively benign. Low inflation, an end to real wage decline, healthy credit markets and strong employment all paint a somewhat more positive picture than recent years.” Next said it remained cautious when drawing up its sales budgets for the new financial year, with the group pencilling in growth of between 2.5% and 7.5%. Profits were expected to grow in line with sales, the company added. The retailer has been returning cash to shareholders by buying back shares as well as declaring special dividends. It has already paid three special dividends – each of 50p and together worth £223m this year – and on Tuesday confirmed plans for a fourth payout, also set at 50p a share. Besi analyst Tony Shiret said Next’s performance boded well for Marks & Spencer. He said: “M&S has also tried to restrict discounting and hold full-price until late in the season. Next’s ability to broadly hold profitability should offer some encouragement that M&S will not see material profit forecast reductions following what has clearly been a tough autumn/winter all around the market.”",diasaster:0},

Qatar Investment Authority and the US investor Brookfield Property Partners had published their final offer document for the majority owner of the London financial district and Songbird said on Tuesday it would send a formal response within the next 14 days. “The board believes that the offer from QIA and Brookfield does not reflect the full value of the company, its unique operating platform and future growth potential,” Songbird said in a statement, advising shareholders to do nothing until they receive Songbird’s official response. Songbird shares were down 1% at 317p by 15:07 GMT, a near 10% discount to the offer that showed investor scepticism it will go through.

QIA and Brookfield said they already had commitments to the Songbird deal from shareholders Third Avenue Management, Madison International and EMS Capital, amounting to around 32% of the company’s “free float” of readily tradeable shares.

{ "title":"​John McDonnell says emergency funds could solve social care crisis", "content": "John McDonnell is demanding that Philip Hammond finds more than £1bn from within the government’s emergency budget plan to rescue Britain’s ailing social care system. The shadow chancellor says the money could come from the “fiscal headroom” left by the chancellor in the autumn budget. The money has been put aside in case of a financial emergency caused by Brexit, reports have claimed. The demands are meant to increase pressure on Theresa May’s government to step in with emergency funding to protect elderly and vulnerable people. In a letter sent to Hammond on Sunday, seen by the Guardian, the shadow chancellor wrote: “Independent estimates by health care charities put the minimum cost of resolving the immediate crisis over this year at £1.9bn. The funding announced by your government covers only a quarter of this. “As you are aware, the necessary funding could be provided to social care and you would remain well inside your own target for deficit reduction, set at 2% of GDP in 2020-21. “With political will, the crisis can be resolved.” On Thursday, the government announced that council tax would be allowed to rise faster than expected – by about £46 a year for an average home – to bail out struggling social care services for the elderly and vulnerable in England. It follows concerns that residential care homes are closing at an unprecedented rate, while hospitals are logjammed with elderly patients with nowhere to go. Local authority cuts have left more than a million people in need of assistance in their homes, charities have claimed. May’s government has been accused of failing to respond adequately to a growing crisis in the sector, which has suffered huge cuts at a time of rising demand. According to the shadow chancellor’s officials, the new fiscal deficit outlined by the chancellor in the autumn statement gives more “fiscal headroom” to raise spending in case of a downturn. The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) estimates this fiscal rule gives the government scope for nearly 2.5% of GDP, or £56 billion, more structural borrowing in 2020-2021. Sources close to McDonnell said it leaves scope for borrowing of 1.2% of GDP, or around £26bn. It has been reported that this “fiscal headroom” had been left by Hammond in case the negative impact of Brexit was worse than OBR estimates. McDonnell’s letter follows a request from Jeremy Corbyn on Saturday for urgent cross-party talks on how the government might avert the deepening crisis in social care this Christmas. A government spokesperson said: “On Thursday, the government announced almost £900m of additional funding over the next two years to tackle these growing pressures. “However we know that money alone is not the solution. There is a diversity of provision across councils, with many already providing high-quality social care services within existing budgets.”",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Lord O'Donnell: creating Brexit departments was tactical error", "content": "Lord O’Donnell, the former cabinet secretary, would have advised the government against forming two new Brexit departments had he still been in Downing Street, it emerged on Sunday. Leavers are angry, for their lies will return to haunt them | Nick Cohen Read more Amid reports of Whitehall tensions between ministers seeking to control the Brexit strategy, the longstanding former head of the civil service said he would have given the functions of the new department for exiting the EU (DEXEU) and department for international trade (DIT) to the Cabinet Office instead. A report from the Institute for Government (IfG), a thinktank, said last week there was “uncertainty and concern” among senior civil servants about the kind of deal the prime minister would like to strike with the EU and civil servants’ roles within it. In an interview with Radio 4’s Westminster Hour, O’Donnell indicated that it he would not have set up any more departments because it takes time for any new departments in Whitehall to settle in. “Machinery of government changes are cumbersome and create all sorts of issues about setting up offices and computer systems and new ministers in new departments. So frankly I’m in favour of trying to use the machine you’ve got rather than redesign the machine because that takes time, inevitably takes time,” he said. “Normally the Cabinet Office would do [the roles of co-ordination] and if I’d been advising the prime minister I’d probably have said ‘This is a standard Cabinet Office function, you don’t need an extra department’,” he said in an interview broadcast on Sunday night. O’Donnell, once known as GOD among officials because of his initials and his constant presence at crucial meetings, was cabinet secretary for six years between 2005 and 2011, and served under three prime ministers. His opinion follows reports of confusion over how the civil service should plan for Brexit. The IfG said: “There are many cases where more information about that negotiating position would support departments in their planning. But Theresa May’s preference is to keep these details under wraps until talks begin … The government should provide departments with more detailed information on the process they are following.” O’Donnell’s intervention was made after Liam Fox, the international trade secretary, told BBC1’s The Andrew Marr Show that the UK could remain a partial member of the EU customs union after Brexit. Sturgeon seeks more powers for Scotland as part of Brexit plan Read more Fox refused to confirm explicitly that he supported a transitional arrangement with the EU to tide Britain over between a formal exit in 2019 and any new trade deal with Brussels, an arrangement the chancellor, Philip Hammond, backs. On the same programme, George Osborne warned that scrapping existing trade arrangements with the EU in the hope of achieving new deals would be the “biggest act of protectionism in British history”. In his first major broadcast interview, he urged the prime minister not to have “red lines” on issues like immigration. “I would say we are leaving the EU – that’s the only red line I would draw – let’s go in there and try and get the best deal for Britain,” he said. He also appeared to take a swipe at Theresa May by emphasising that he was at the forefront of the remain campaign, while others chose to sit it out. The prime minister has faced criticism for a low profile during the campaign, even though she was supposed to be campaigning to stay in the EU. Asked if it was true that he did not want Cameron to hold a referendum, Osborne said: “I wasn’t a great fan of having a referendum but I am also a team player. And politics is most successful when you are part of a team. Once we were in the referendum, I did everything I could to win it. I was not going to sit it out.”",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Light brigade: carrying the torch for London's last gas street lamps", "content": "Gas lamps have twinkled through the fog in every period film set in London, lighting the way for Ebenezer Scrooge, Sherlock Holmes, and the merry murderers of The Ladykillers. Yet few people are aware that 1,500 gas lamps still shine on in the city every night. Or rather 1,498 since a reversing lorry demolished one outside St James’s Palace, and then, to the driver’s hideous embarrassment, returned the following week and demolished another. The necklace of lights strung on lamp posts, some up to 200 years old, stretches from Bromley-by-Bow in the East End to Richmond Bridge in the west of the capital. As the Guardian accompanied lamp lighters on their nightly round, people walked past, did a double take, and turned back to gaze in wonder at a man up a ladder delicately polishing a pane of glass or winding an almost 150-year-old clockwork mechanism. When Garry Usher was repairing central heating boilers for British Gas, and Iain Bell was the man to phone on the helpdesk if he got into difficulty, neither had the slightest idea that any gas lamps survived in London, still less that central streets including Cowley Street tucked in behind Westminster Abbey, the millionaire’s row of Kensington Palace Gardens, and a tiny courtyard, Pickering Place, where the last duel in London was fought, are still entirely lit by gas. “To me,” Bell says, through careful maneuvering, “it’s a beautiful quality of light, more mellow, far more attractive to me than the electrical.” Facebook Twitter Pinterest Garry Usher checks a gas lamp in Westminster. Photograph: David Levene for the Guardian Walking through Dean’s Yard, the open square within Westminster Abbey, which is entirely gas-lit, he says with a sigh: “When there was a power cut here a few weeks back, all you could see was the gas light with the darkness all around, a wonderful sight.” Charles Dickens in 1838 described lamp lighters as a tribe apart, “clinging to old ceremonies and customs which have been handed down among them from father to son since the first public lamp was lighted out of doors”. In 1939 in Ghosts of London, HV Morton lamented their inevitable passing. “We’re the last of the old brigade,” one told him. Now there are just five, supervised by Bell, to keep the lamps burning. Usher is the star who can repair anything, and makes lead fittings to hold the handmade glass when broken panes have to be replaced. “There’s nobody to touch him,” Bell says reverently, safely out of his hearing, “the man is a legend.” There are more gas lamps on private land, and Hyde Park and the Palace of Westminster have their own teams. Bell and Usher are amused that they are not allowed into parliament on security grounds, but trot in and out of Buckingham Palace every other week – “We see the Queen quite often, she gives us a wave,” Usher says. Usher, from east London, became a lamp lighter because he didn’t mind night work and, being a keen rugby player, wanted Saturdays off. Bell started out in Scotland and eventually moved south, steadily promoted by British Gas, until he learned to his surprise that these relics of 19th-century engineering genius had become his responsibility. He is now a walking history of their development, pointing out lamp posts with the insignia of Queen Victoria, her uncle George IV and her grandson George V, supporting lanterns in Rochester or Windsor shapes. Most have been made taller to protect them from being walloped by vehicles much higher than the horse-drawn traffic they originally lit, and if they have a little door in the base they’re later replicas of the Victorian originals. The earliest lamp lighters lit each by hand at dusk every night, and returned at dawn to extinguish them. Bell says that what saved the lamps from being written off when electricity arrived were the mantles made of silk coated in lime oxide, which made them much more efficient than a naked flame, and the clockwork lighting mechanism. Hundreds still run on their Victorian clockwork, and the rest on battery packs, but all still need attention at least once a fortnight to wind the clockwork or replace batteries and mantels. In 1807 experimental lamps were specially installed in Pall Mall and lit to celebrate the birthday of George III in June 1807: they continued burning until midnight and people stood for hours staring at them in wonder. A plaque in Great Peter Street marks the site of the Gas Light and Coke Company, the gasworks that from 1813 lit Westminster Bridge and provided the first public supply in the world. Bell says regional managers are often stunned to learn that more than 200 years later gas lamps still light some of the prettiest corners of London, and write asking for information. “I always tell them to come and see for themselves, and we take them on a little tour. They go away delighted. Spreading the word is the best way to keep them.” When local residents and shopkeepers see Usher up a ladder near their premises, they tend to panic. “People become terribly attached to them, and think their hour has finally come. They rush out pleading with me not to take them away. They are so relieved when I tell them my job is to keep the gas lamps burning forever.”",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Joan Ravenscroft obituary", "content": "Our aunt, Joan Ravenscroft, who has died aged 97, devoted her early life to ballet, dancing with various prominent companies in the 1930s before deciding to end her career in order to raise a family. Born in Coulsdon, Surrey, to Sidney Kent, a businessman, and Emily (nee Pullen), Joan went to St Martin’s high school in central London before training at the Cone School of Dancing in the capital. She first performed in public, aged 12, as a costermonger in a cabaret at the Dickens and Jones tearooms in Regent Street in 1930. At 13 she won a prize in the Sunshine Babies competition at the Scala theatre in London, greatly impressing Dame Ninette de Valois, founder of the Royal Ballet, who invited her to join the Vic-Wells Ballet. Joan reluctantly declined after her mother insisted she should complete her education. Eventually, in 1935, at the age of 17, Joan joined the Markova–Dolin Company, formed by the British stars Alicia Markova and Anton Dolin. As the company toured all over England, Joan shared “digs” with Markova’s younger sister, Bunny Marks, and danced many roles in the corps de ballet. When Markova and Dolin moved to the US, Joan joined Molly Lake’s company, Ballet Intime (1938-39) and from 1939 until 1941 she was part of the Arts Theatre ballet company in London. When the second world war broke out, Joan joined the Women’s Auxiliary Air Force, where she choreographed and performed in revues. In 1942 she married Tony Ravenscroft, a soldier who became an oil company executive, and began to raise a family. Later she taught dance but soon branched out into developing breathing, stretching and stress-reduction exercises based on her knowledge of dance disciplines. This led her to work with what is now the Stress Management Training Institute. Having appeared in videos and other training materials for the charity, she was still helping out at the age of 88, giving tips to nurses on how to help rehabilitate patients in hospital. Although Joan had given up dancing, she maintained an interest in ballet and theatre throughout her life and, until fairly recently, attended performances of the Royal Ballet and Mariinsky Ballet, when they visited London. An exhibition of previously unseen photographs of Joan by Angus McBean was shown at the Oxford Playhouse and at the Pegasus theatre, Oxford, in 2011. Joan was much loved and admired by her family and friends for her kindness, independent spirit and irreverent sense of humour, which set the tone for many happy family gatherings. She is survived by her three children, Richard, Paul and Mary, by five grandchildren, and by five great-grandchildren.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Is Trading Places the best financial film ever?", "content": "For filmmakers, the financial crisis just keeps on giving. January sees the UK release of The Big Short, the latest in a line of dramas and feature-length documentaries about the high-stakes world of financial markets leading up to the crash. It is based on Michael Lewis’s bestselling book about eccentric investors who predicted the demise of the US subprime mortgage market and bet against an increasingly shaky financial system. The film has already won plaudits for tackling chewy concepts, including collateralised debt obligations, through big name stars such as Steve Carell and Brad Pitt. The Big Short is far from unique in its accessibility, however. Filmmakers have a long history of raking over crashes and exposing the iniquity of markets. Our business team picks seven other financial-themed films to watch this holiday. Trading Places (1983) This is a classic: not just the ultimate Christmas film but the best film about financial markets ever made. In our family, Christmas hasn’t really begun until we have all sat down to watch this morality tale set in the Philadelphia of the early 1980s. Randolph and Mortimer Duke are crooked brothers who own the commodity brokers Duke and Duke. Randolph is an ardent believer that people are shaped by their environment and makes a bet with his brother they can replace the Harvard-educated snob (Louis Winthorpe), who runs their business, with a conman from the ghetto (Billy Ray Valentine) without any detrimental effect on their business. They contrive to get Winthorpe arrested and fired on trumped up drugs charges and make the switch. What neither Winthorpe nor Valentine know is that the Dukes have a plan to get hold of a top secret government report that will enable them to clean up in the market for orange juice. Trading Places is utterly hilarious from start to finish, while at the same time capturing how financial markets work with pitch-perfect accuracy. Dan Aykroyd and Eddie Murphy have never been better in their roles as Winthorpe and Valentine, and there are splendid supporting performances from Don Ameche and Ralph Bellamy as the Dukes, Denholm Elliott as Coleman the butler, and Jamie Lee Curtis as the hooker with the heart of gold. Watch out also for a cameo from Bo Diddley as the pawnbroker. Top quote: “In this building, it’s either kill or be killed. You make no friends in the pits and you take no prisoners.

In a pivotal scene, James Stewart’s George Bailey persuades panicked customers to resist the overtures of the odious banker Potter and keep faith in their long-term investments in his Building and Loans society. No, it’s not quite how it later panned out in Britain’s post-Thatcher financial evolution: when most societies demutualised, took the money and ran.

Through a prudent deposit, Mr Banks informs his reluctant son: “You’ll be part of railways in Africa, dams across the Nile, majestic self-amortising canals.” Michael resists, runs off with his tuppence, and sparks a run on the bank. The conclusion is clear.

Photograph: Everett Collection/Rex The Man in the White Suit (1951) Britain, 1951: smokestacks, textile towns, bombsites, food rationing. Perhaps 9 million workers in trade unions. On London’s South Bank, under the shadow of the futuristic Skylon, the festival of Britain points the way to a technological workers’ paradise. Meanwhile audiences in smoke-filled cinemas – many, I would like to think, still wearing their sturdy demob suits from the Burton cloth empire – settle down to watch Alec Guinness as Sidney Stratton. The unworldly, innocent chemist in his lab, surrounded by gently bubbling test tubes and flasks as he pursues his dream of a material that will repel all dirt and never wear out. Everlasting clean clothes – no more drudgery in the textile mills, no more washboards and chapped hands. It has been said that obsolescence was first deliberately built in to consumer goods in the 1920s by a shady cartel of lightbulb manufacturers in Germany who reduced the working lives of their bulbs from 2,500 hours to 1,000. Ever since then we have been working ever faster to consume ever more. But when Stratton finally appears to have succeeded, textile workers and bosses alike quickly realise the technological miracle will consign their jobs and fortunes to history. An unholy alliance is formed, of cigar-smoking capitalists and cap-wearing labour, ranged against, well, disruptive technology, you might call it. Stratton’s dream turns to nightmare as, gleaming in white, he is chased through the sooty streets by an angry mob. Finally he is cornered and grabbed by the hands of the mob, but the suit has begun to disintegrate, turning to pretty white fluff, melting into the sooty air. The nightmare turns back into a dream.

Photograph: Allstar Margin Call (2011) The film is a clever portrayal of the investment banking meltdown of 2008, capturing the sense that giant firms, operating over-complex financial models that their own directors did not understand, could fold like a pack of cards. The memory of Lehman Brothers is never far away. Margin Call opens with a classic scene from the crisis years: mass sackings on the trading floor, executed without compassion and with military-like speed. One of the victims is veteran risk analyst Eric Dale (Stanley Tucci) who slips a computer file to a young brain-box analyst Peter Sullivan (Zachary Quinto). The data shows the firm’s position in junk mortgages is far worse than anybody understood. Or, as Jeremy Irons, as the bank’s flashy and immoral big boss, puts it after flying in by helicopter at night: “So, what you’re telling me is that the music is about to stop, and we’re going to be left holding the biggest bag of odorous excrement ever assembled in the history of capitalism.” As Irons attempts to cajole lead character Sam Rogers (Kevin Spacey) into a disgraceful plan to save the firm while legging over clients, Margin Call is a reminder of just how cynical modern banking can be behind the steel and glass facades.

Photograph: Snap / Rex Wall Street (1987) Jam-packed with quotable one-liners, Wall Street ruthlessly – and enjoyably – portrays the inner workings of financial capitalism, 1980s style. The sleekly amoral Gordon Gekko, played by Michael Douglas, makes a fortune through insider trading, share ramping, and asset-stripping, and his protege Bud Fox, played by a young Charlie Sheen, comes along for the ride. Fox believes he is as ruthless and determined as his red braces-wearing, Cuban cigar-smoking mentor; but finally balks at ripping apart the airline for which his salt-of-the-earth dad, played by his real-life father Martin Sheen, is the union rep. It’s not subtle, but it’s well-acted and beautifully shot, from Gekko watching the sunrise over the shore clutching a brick-sized cellphone, to the cosy nooks of the wood-panelled diner where he treats Fox to steak tartare and urges him to get a proper suit. And while Gekko’s “greed is good” polemics may seem overdone, you only have to read the emails that flew back and forth between the traders in the libor-rigging cases earlier this year, to know that his spirit is alive and well.

Photograph: Mary Cybulski/Paramount Pictures The Wolf of Wall Street (2013) Martin Scorsese’s draining black comedy, crammed with sex and drugs, tells the story of real-life crooked stockbroker Jordan Belfort. While earlier audiences were prepared to let “greed is good” Gekko off the hook, Scorsese and his leading man Leonardo DiCaprio faced a much tougher crowd – their film hit cinemas at the time many viewers were picking up the pieces from the global financial crisis. The Wolf of Wall Street charts the rise and the not so terrible fall of Belfort – he served only 22 months in jail for securities fraud. The protagonist evolves from shy new starter on Wall Street to loud-mouthed founder of Long Island brokerage house Stratton Oakmont, where he uses a boiler room of equally raucous colleagues to bully savers into get-rich-quick penny share schemes. Eventually he is snared by the FBI. Film critics were full of praise for the film’s relentless pace, dazzling performances and outlandish plot. DiCaprio and Belfort himself both defended it as a cautionary tale. But many viewers, including his victims, understandably felt the film was too easy on the fraudster and glamourised his excessive lifestyle.

But the ever-increasing speed of the fashion trend cycle means that buying a trophy piece of 2015 fashion when the year has only days to go is increasingly a false economy – however eye-catching the discount. The new breed of sales shoppers are applying next year’s style rules to last year’s collections. Many of the trends thaat dominated the spring/summer 2016 catwalk shows – the clothes which will go into stores in February – can be found in the collections now being discounted. The key to resisting being baited by retailers desperate to offload the clothes with the most pressing sell-by dates is to approach the sales with a clear wishlist. Facebook Twitter Pinterest ‘Cold shoulder’ pieces were a popular trend for the party season. Photograph: David Newby for the Guardian Avoid at all costs any clothes with words on them. Slogans have an immediate appeal, but nothing dates faster. However much they speak to you at this moment, you will be sick of them in weeks. Avoid, also, buying the dress you wish you’d worn at the Christmas party you went to three weeks ago. There is absolutely no chance you will want to want to wear it to next year’s Christmas party. One advantageous side-effect of the fast-forward trend cycle is that whereas once the sales were stocked with clothes that had been languishing on rails for four months, many of the pieces now being discounted only “dropped” six weeks ago. “Cold shoulder” pieces – dresses, blouses and knits with cut-outs exposing the shoulder – were a popular trend for the party season. But what we’ve seen so far is only the tip of the cold-shoulder iceberg. On the spring/summer catwalks, designers as diverse as Chloe, Ralph Lauren and Versace all made bare shoulders a focal point. A cold-shoulder knit or blouse, that you can wear with jeans and boots for winter weekends, is a sound Twixmas sales investment.

Nineteen out of 20 pieces on the shop floor will be too dressy to be practical, unless you have a specific New Year’s party in mind, so you can hone your shortlist by a strict focus on pieces suitable for the low-key lifestyle of January and February. The “glam geek” trend, inspired by Gucci, dominated last season’s high street and will continue into 2016. Not only the spring collection, but the recently unveiled pre-fall collection that will follow it into stores later in 2016, are permeated with a look which is half-library, half-disco: metallic fabrics, pussy bows, bright colours, chunky heels and a maximal approach to accessories. From this look, the best pieces to cherry-pick are midi-length skirts in fine pleats. Wear with a contrast colour crewneck sweater for an on-trend but easy daytime look. Swerve the remnants of the 1970s trend, which will be much in evidence in the sale but is firmly on the skids. Instead, keep in mind the first key fashion phrase of 2016: post-normal.

{ "title":"If you found treasure worth thousands would you declare it? ", "content": "Arthur, my friend Steve tells me, was a wonderful grandfather. He loved the company of younger people, and always had a good story to tell. He remained as sharp as a pin and lived independently until his death at 101. His gold retirement watch, which stopped on the day he died, still sits on Steve’s beside table. Throughout his official working life he toiled blamelessly at the General Post Office. He was a union official, popular and respected, and active in local politics. It was after he retired and received his watch that he went rogue. He fell in with a crew of geriatric delinquents and started working the racecourses. The greybeards had the ticketing system stitched up. They were the dependable stewards – bowler-hatted, with perfect manners – who met the millionaires off their helicopters. Their job was to sell these people stupendously expensive tickets for the VIP enclosure. The tickets came in sealed packets, numbered and dated. A couple of members of the grizzled racket worked inside the ticket office, and issued more packets than the sellers were likely to use. On the way to the helipad, the old crims would open the surplus packets with a razor blade, extract one or two tickets from each pack, then melt the wax seal and, pressing it back into shape, use it to close the opening they had made. They sold the black tickets on their own account, and each made many hundreds. The old boys in the office then logged the packets back in, recorded them as complete and put them in the incinerator. When Steve was a teenager, he helped his grandad for a day with what he believed were official ticket sales, for the standard wage of a tenner. When the job was done, one of the gang members pressed £150 into his hand. It might have been through this venerable crew that Arthur met a dissolute auctioneer, also advanced in years, with a sharp eye for business and a selective blindness for how it was conducted. Arthur was employed to bid up prices in the auction room and to help move the goods selected for sale. Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs soon began to take an unhealthy interest in Arthur’s affairs; eventually he was stung for £6,000 in back tax. One day the two old rogues were working through a house after probate had been granted, with one of the sons of the deceased, when Arthur stumbled across something not listed in the will. It was a box containing 60 George V gold sovereigns, minted in Pretoria in the 1920s. The hoard was worth many thousands of pounds. There were two options. The first was to declare the find, whereupon it would be listed as an asset of the deceased’s estate. It would then be subject to inheritance tax, and the residue divided among the beneficiaries of the will. The second was to say nothing and split it three ways. The three philosophers examined the question long and hard, interrogating it from the point of view of Socrates, Aristotle and Epicurus, before divvying up the loot. Arthur took his share and hid it in his house. He told his family about this good fortune but never revealed where he had stashed the treasure. There are not many hiding places in a 1950s bungalow: none of the priestholes or tunnels or sliding panels behind which gold is traditionally hidden. So after the old man’s funeral, when Steve and his father went to clear his house, they never doubted that they would find the hoard. They rolled back the carpets. They pulled open the base of the divan. Steve brought in a ladder and checked the pelmets of the heavy old curtains. They lifted the insulation in the loft and searched inside the water tank. By the time they had finished, every crevice and cornice had been examined. Reluctantly they gave up, appointed an estate agent and put the house on the market. Steve’s father tried to contact the auctioneer, but couldn’t track him down. Perhaps the old soak was on a bender: he had, after all, failed to attend the funeral. But some time after the house was sold, the auctioneer at last rang back. “Oh no,” he confirmed, “he never sold the sovereigns. They were just about the only things he kept.” “So where are they?” “He used them as curtain weights.” Steve’s father has also now passed away, so we don’t know exactly what he said when he rang the new owners. But we know that he trod a delicate line between discovering what he was after and not alerting them to his intent. The conversation went something like this: “We didn’t go through the house as carefully as we might have, and I think we could have left some items of sentimental value behind. I was wondering whether they might still be there.” “Well the house was completely empty. There was nothing in it except the carpets and the curtains.” “Ah, those lovely carpets and curtains! I can’t think of them without picturing my father sitting in his armchair.” “You want the curtains and carpets?” “He didn’t leave very much behind, you see.” “I’m sorry to say that we’ve ripped them all out.” “Well, yes, of course – that’s perfectly understandable. What did you do with them?” “We put them in the skip.” “Is the skip – is it, er, full yet?” “Oh yes, they took it away on Thursday. It all went to the dump.

{ "title":"UK house price growth slows in last three months as property market cools", "content": "The pace of house price growth slowed sharply in the last three months of 2014, according to Nationwide Building Society, although prices ended the year 8.3% higher than in the same period of 2013. In more evidence of the rapidly cooling property market, three regions of the UK – north-west England, Yorkshire and Humberside, and Wales – recorded price declines in the final quarter of the year. Across the UK, average prices edged up 0.2% in December and 1.1% in the quarter, taking the average price to £189,002. In London the typical home changed hands for £406,730, up 2.5% on the quarter and up 17.8% over 12 months. Prices in the capital are now 35% above their former peak in 2007. Among large towns and cities, St Albans recorded the highest increase in prices, up by 24% over the year to an average of £494,777, closely followed by a 19% rise in Reading and a 17% rise in Belfast. The Northern Ireland capital recorded a dramatic boom and bust in its property market during the neighbouring Republic’s Celtic Tiger years but it is now showing signs of recovery, albeit from a low base. However, several cities in the UK recorded zero or very low house price growth over the year. In Manchester prices failed to rise over the year, while in Leicester the rise was 3% and in Liverpool it was 5%. * This figure is on a different basis to the London regional index to enable a direct comparison with other towns and cities Nationwide’s chief economist, Robert Gardner, said: “All regions except the north of England saw a slowing in annual price growth in the final quarter of 2014. London was the top performing region for the second year running. “Yorkshire and Humberside was the weakest performing English region, with prices up 1.5% over the year. “Annual price growth in Scotland moderated to 4.2%. Northern Ireland saw an 8.1% increase in prices, although they are still around 47% below their 2007 peak.” Economists expect that recent changes to stamp duty announced by the chancellor, George Osborne, which will mean 98% of buyers pay lower amounts of tax, will have only a limited impact on the slowdown in house price growth. Howard Archer, chief UK and eurozone economist at IHS, said: “While the stamp duty reform should have some beneficial impact on the housing market, we doubt it will cause housing activity and prices to see a major turnaround. We expect house prices to rise by a solid but unspectacular 5% in 2015.” Falls in the volume of mortgage activity, tighter affordability checks and the prospect of potentially higher interest rates in 2015 are all seen as factors holding back buyers. Mark Harris, chief executive of mortgage broker SPF Private Clients, said: “There is growing evidence of a slowdown in the housing market, with tougher criteria as a result of the mortgage market review now really having an impact. “The changes to stamp duty should provide a modest fillip in the spring but we expect uncertainty around the general election to keep the housing market fairly subdued until after May. Once the election result is known, we expect the pent-up demand from the start of the year to be released and the year overall to be a strong one, with around £215bn of lending.”",diasaster:0},

Given, as John Lanchester explains in his excellent book How to Speak Money, we have, by a process he calls “reversification”, turned the odious concept of debt into something respectable by calling it credit, why not start talking about the privilege of paying taxes rather than the burden? My father was very proud when his income rose high enough to have to pay income tax. As a teacher in the second part of last century, my income never rose high enough for me to qualify for the higher rate, but it would have been nice if it had. Peter Wrigley Birstall, West Yorkshire • I am at the age when I start to benefit from the taxes I have paid over the years. I feel no guilt at receiving my pension and know that should I be ill the NHS is still there for me. I will no doubt be relying on local services for the elderly, paid for by my tax. My father said to me long ago: “Never worry about those who claim to be paying too much tax, you have to be earning the money to pay it.” I am sure there are many working long hours for low wages who wish they were wealthy enough to complain about their taxes. David Watson Nutley, East Sussex • Speaking on the Today programme, Jon Moulton of Better Capital, owner of City Link, said: “City Link has paid a fortune into the exchequer on such things as PAYE.” I must have been ungrateful to my employers over a lifetime for not recognising that it was they, not I, who’d been paying my PAYE.

{ "title":"Former Korea Air executive detained over ‘nut rage’ incident", "content": "A South Korean court has ordered that a former Korean Air Lines executive be detained for delaying a flight after an outburst over the way she was served nuts, in a case that prompted outrage and ridicule. Cho Hyun-ah, the daughter of the airline’s chairman and head of in-flight service before she resigned after the incident, had demanded the chief steward be removed from the flight at John F Kennedy airport in New York on 5 December for serving macadamia nuts in a bag, not a dish. The court’s decision late on Tuesday comes after prosecutors last week sought a detention warrant for Cho, 40, who faces charges of violating aviation safety laws. “The necessity for detention is recognised as the case is grave and there has been an attempt to systematically cover up charges from the beginning,” Lee Kwang-woo, a judge at the Seoul western district court who handles media affairs, said in a text message. In what media have dubbed the “nut rage” incident, the Airbus A380 jet, which had pushed back from its gate, returned for the chief attendant to disembark. The flight arrived in Incheon, near Seoul, 11 minutes late. On her way to a detention facility from the prosecutors’ office late on Tuesday, Cho was flanked by prosecution officials and did not respond to questions from media, only saying “sorry” several times, her eyes closed and her head bowed. An inquiry by South Korea’s transport ministry concluded that Cho abused flight attendants in the incident, and that airline officials may have tried to cover up the episode. The ministry came under fire after revelations that some of its officials leaked information to the company and committed other misconduct during the investigation. The ministry said on Monday it would penalise eight officials involved in the case, one of whom was detained on Friday. Public outrage over the case grew when Korean Air initially issued what many people took to be a half-hearted apology that appeared to rationalise Cho’s conduct in the face of what it said was inadequate performance by the cabin crew. Cho’s case has aggravated public resentment towards the country’s powerful family-run conglomerates, called chaebol, stirred by their dominance of the economy and a widening wealth gap in society. Cho Hyun-ah is the eldest of Korean Air chairman Cho Yang-ho’s three children. Her siblings are also executives with the airline.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Warburtons on a roll as it toasts success of Muppets' Christmas ad", "content": "It’s a long way from Bolton to Hollywood, in more ways than one. But when Jonathan Warburton decided to splash out on a Christmas publicity drive for the family baking business, it was to Los Angeles – and the Disney headquarters – that he went. The result is a Christmas ad that has blown the usual favourites out of the water, thanks to the services of Kermit the Frog, Miss Piggy and the rest of the Muppets. How we made: The Muppet Christmas Carol Read more For those that have not seen it, the ad features the Muppets performing a version of their TV show’s theme tune, adapted to celebrate the launch of Warburtons’ Giant Crumpets. It is probably the first Muppets skit to feature references to Manchester’s Arndale shopping centre and Coronation Street. And while the annual John Lewis schmaltzfest was struggling to tug on the nation’s heartstrings, Warburtons’ effort beat out a tattoo on our collective funny bone, winning a poll of viewers’ favourite TV spots. “I have been amazed at the response,” said Warburton, who appears in the ad fending off the advances of an amorous Miss Piggy, driven wild with lust by his grip on the crumpet market. Facebook Twitter Pinterest The company recently invested £50m in new baking equipment at its factory. Photograph: Christopher Thomond for the Guardian It is not the first time the family-owned bakery has spent big to get stars on board for its ads. The first such campaign featured Sylvester Stallone testing the limits of his acting ability as a heroic muscle-bound bread van driver fighting through the snow to bring baked goods to a desperate public. After a long time courting the Rocky star, Warburton finally pinned him down over dinner in a hotel somewhere between Leeds and Wakefield in West Yorkshire. He told the actor: “Look, Sly, this is a lot of money. I need to know you’re committed.” The “delightful” Oscar winner agreed, clearly starstruck by meeting the chairman of Britain’s top bread company. “It’s just like talking to Rocky,” recalled Warburton. But if it comes as a surprise to find this family business in the same corner as a Hollywood actor, it ought not to be, for Warburtons is a heftier player than one might imagine. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Judge Bread: actor Sylvester Stallone has also earned a crust advertising Warburtons. Not only is it Bolton’s biggest business but it is Britain’s second-largest grocery brand overall, with annual supermarket sales of £800m. That puts it second only to Coca-Cola in the UK. By market share it is streets ahead of its rivals Hovis and Kingsmill, whose combined market share of 25% is just below the 26% who get their daily bread from the Bolton baker. The gulf is even wider in what Warburton refers to as rugby league territory around the M62. Food fight: the secrets of the supermarket price war Read more Despite its size, Warburtons is far from immune to the fallout from a vicious war among the supermarkets, as discounters such as Aldi and Lidl force the likes of Tesco to cut prices. “It’s as tough now as I’ve ever known it,” said Warburton. “The baking industry has much capacity available, more than is needed by the consumer, which puts the power in the hands of the retailer. And they’ll be very hard on you.” Tesco recently reduced the number of Warburtons products it sells and does not stock the Giant Crumpets so beloved of Kermit, Miss Piggy and co. “My hope is that people will write in [because of the ad], saying they can’t find their Giant Crumpets, and they’ll bring them back,” says Warburton. The family business has demonstrated the sort of staying power that should serve it well in negotiations with big business. Warburton and his two cousins are the fifth generation of the family to run the company. For comparison, only 3% of family businesses manage to extend their dynasty to a fourth generation. In 1876, though, baking was just a way for Warburton’s great-great-uncle and -aunt to supplement the income for their grocery shop. Back when they started selling freshly baked loaves, Bolton was a smoggy industrial maze of cotton mills and iron foundries, where most people would not dream of buying bread when it could be baked just as well at home. Facebook Twitter Pinterest The Bolton plant churns out 1.2m loaves each week. Photograph: Christopher Thomond for the Guardian But with the arrival of the 20th century, as women began going to work and the faster pace of life ate into the time available for home baking, the business grew and grew. These days it has 4,500 employees, and last year it posted a £78m profit on revenues of £548m. About 1,000 trucks serve 18,500 retailers each day, while the company recently invested £50m in new baking equipment for the factory. One in five UK households dump a loaf of bread in the bin, survey reveals Read more Down on the factory floor, that money is being put to work. Loaves in various states of readiness crisscross the warehouse, being moulded, cooled, heated, shaped, sliced and packaged by various shiny bits of kit. It is like a bread version of Willie Wonka’s chocolate factory, only with Lancastrians rather than Oompa Loompas. Like many towns in this part of the world, the local economy suffered badly from the decline of industry and, in some ways, Warburtons is a microcosm of that. This one factory in Bolton churns out 1.2m loaves a week, part of an output of 12m across the business. But while it has grown rapidly, the cast-iron links between the business and local people’s lives have faded. Where once there were bakers’ houses right up to the factory door, there is now a car park. It takes only a handful of staff to run the impressive mechanised factory floor operation, where once teams of bakers did the job. Facebook Twitter Pinterest About 9% of profits go into a pot to be shared among staff just before Christmas. Photograph: Christopher Thomond for the Guardian But those who do work here are relatively well rewarded. About 9% of profits go into a pot shared among staff just before Christmas, while the company already pays the £7.20 living wage and plans to raise that to the Living Wage Foundation’s higher minimum of £8.25. The company has also spent its money in other ways, including a £25,000 donation to the Tory party in 2010. David Cameron even visited the Bolton bakery, where he struggled to raise much enthusiasm among the staff. Warburton, who describes himself as a free-marketeer, admits it was an unusual decision for a company that is largely apolitical. “It’s a Labour town historically and the company has never aligned itself but we felt at the time that the country needed a change,” he said. “We’ve taken quite a bit of stick for it but we knew that when we put our heads above the parapet. We haven’t done it since.”",diasaster:0},

In her annual message, which traditionally has a strong religious framework, the Queen said: “It is true that the world had to confront moments of darkness this year, but the Gospel of John contains a verse of great hope, often read at Christmas carol services, ‘The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it.’” Speaking in a year also dominated by the plight of hundreds of thousands of refugees flooding into Europe, she said the birth of Jesus in a stable was in circumstances which “were far from ideal, but worse was to come as the family was forced to flee the country”.

She looked back on a year which saw her surpass Victoria’s record to become the nation’s longest reigning monarch, and ahead to a year which will see her celebrate another milestone, her 90th birthday on 21 April, and about which she made a light-hearted reference.

Many people say the first Christmas after losing a loved one is particularly hard. But it’s also a time to remember all that we have to be thankful for. “One cause for thankfulness this summer was marking 70 years since the end of the second world war.

Electric lights had long replaced candles on the tree since Victoria’s day. Sounding an optimistic note, she said: “There’s an old saying that it is better to light a candle than curse the darkness. There are millions of people lighting candles of hope in our world today.

{ "title":"Coldplay: how can something so banal be so powerful?", "content": "One should always hesitate before quoting the words from pop songs. Obviously, lyrics are not written as poetry; in the absence of music, even Bob Dylan’s words can occasionally seem like the work of a chump. But sometimes the temptation becomes overwhelming. Take, for example, Up & Up, the closing song on the latest Coldplay album, A Head Full Of Dreams, which came out on 4 December. Its second verse runs as follows: “Lying in the gutter, aiming for the moon / Trying to empty out the ocean with a spoon … How come people suffer, how come people part? / How come people struggle, how come people break your heart?” I don’t know what that riot of mixed metaphor and cheap sentiment means; its chief author, Chris Martin, probably doesn’t either. But whatever: as the song tumbles to its climax and massed voices assure us that “we’re gonna get it together”, you can hear the stuff of assured international success. What is the meaning of Coldplay? The question may seem absurd. Certainly, the lyrics that adorn the band’s songs – mostly “cliches and generalisations”, as the Guardian’s Alexis Petridis recently put it – and the interviews they give only seem to confirm an overwhelming sense of blankness. There again, as any cultural theorist could tell you, what they may or may not have come to tell us isn’t the point: when you’ve sold 80 million albums, it’s legitimate to ask why. What does Coldplay music do to people? What needs does it meet? Will it ever go away? Coldplay: A Head Full of Dreams review – a failure to commit to pop Read more Before we go any further, a confession. I like some of Coldplay’s music. They have a gift for melody and a knack of evoking emotion that makes their biggest hits almost irresistible. Sometimes – as on Fix You, arguably their defining song – the music becomes lachrymose. Often, it drifts into absolute nothingness. But when it comes to their hits, they usually locate the correct spot. This is partly because their best compositions are liberally sprinkled with what the modern vernacular terms earworms. But at the heart of Coldplay’s allure is a talent for capturing something fundamental to contemporary living. The most I can say is this: their best songs make me feel like I am in a mobile phone advert, or sitting in a gleaming airport terminal, luxuriating in a brief moment of respite from sensory overload. They specialise in fuzzy, redemptive qualities that are almost indefinable, captured in the refrain at the end of Clocks, still their single greatest achievement: “Home, home, where I wanted to go.” But God, their latest music is doing my head in. For A Head Full Of Dreams, they drafted in the Norwegian production duo Stargate, who have created music for Rihanna and Beyoncé. The residual earthiness in Coldplay’s music traceable to their origins as an indie-rock band has now disappeared: their songs now sounds gossamer-light, and so easy on the ear it sometimes threatens to disappear. Facebook Twitter Pinterest ‘In 2002 and beyond, the world was in need of existential balm, and Coldplay delivered.’ Photograph: Sarah Jeynes/BBC/PA The album’s sleeve art is a rainbow-coloured mess of exotic birds, planets, and clouds. And the words! The lyrics are smattered with angels, diamonds and Egyptian pyramids. By way of proving that Martin is free of earthly pettiness, there are vocals from his ex-wife Gwyneth Paltrow on a song called Everglow, an apparent celebration of the fact that love can endure even after divorce, whose title is a word for bliss he got from an American surfer. The back of the CD booklet apparently features the band’s name in Hindi; a track built around a 13th century Sufi poem popular on mindfulness courses (which, says Martin, boils down to the idea that “every feeling that we have as humans is ultimately a blessing”) also includes a sample of Barack Obama singing Amazing Grace. Of course it does. Coldplay arrived in 2000. They became international stars with the release of A Rush Of Blood To The Head, in late 2002. In between lay 11 September 2001, the sudden curtailing of an era of giddy hedonism, and the arrival of realities that were altogether more worrisome. Martin and co proved to be capable lightning rods for all this. Again, basic cultural theory will tell you that need not be a matter of intention, and in this case, it almost certainly wasn’t. But the world was in need of existential balm, and they delivered. Almost every Coldplay record since has dealt in much the same qualities: reassurance, redemption, an insistence that what it is to be human will somehow see us through (to take one example among many, witness a new song titled Amazing Day and its cringeworthy lines: “Hope has its proof / Your hand in mine / Life has a beautiful crazy design”). How I came to terms with my Coldplay fandom Read more Their songs seem to become lighter and more blithely optimistic in direct proportion to the troubled nature of the world. The worse everything gets, in other words, the more they seem driven to reassure us, in language often so banal it beggars belief. This is perhaps why they are still here, now much bigger than the fading U2, booked to play four nights at Wembley Stadium, and scheduled to entertain the crowd at the 2016 Superbowl. On one level, this bothers me. It looks like another sign that popular music can now carry little more than emotional doggerel. To risk sounding hopelessly sniffy, that comes with a sense of musicians doing pretty much what serves the interests of power – “The Man”, as the hippies put it – and assuring us everything’s going to be OK when it plainly isn’t. But from another perspective, it might also suggest music re-emphasising what draws in most of its devotees: escapism, empathy and the simple acknowledgement that the sun always rises in the morning. One of the most-reported human stories of the year came when a man called Davide Martello took his piano from Germany to the Bataclan in Paris after hearing about the terrorist attacks. He played John Lennon’s Imagine – that saccharine secular hymn, well suited to almost any occasion – and made people cry. But Coldplay had got there first, covering the same song within hours of the atrocities, at a gig in Los Angeles. You can watch the footage on YouTube: the four of them at the lip of the stage, missing out the “no religion” line, delivering the song with their customary brand of guileless sincerity. As with just about everything they do, it suggests Noel Coward’s oft-quoted point about the potency of cheap music, though it needs a bit of elaboration: in times as uneasy and fearful as ours, Coldplay’s unlikely magic is about how context – and enormous popularity – can give outwardly shallow art a power it almost doesn’t deserve.",diasaster:0},

The face of Pluto emerged from the gloom to reveal a dazzling landscape of ridges, ice mountains and plains of solid nitrogen hundreds of miles wide. Robots on the ground and in the sky above Mars found ancient water marks and then evidence that water flows there today, leaving dark streaks on the walls of craters and gullies. Another probe plunged through frigid geysers that spray from Enceladus, one of Saturn’s moons : the vapour propelled by hydrothermal energy in a global ocean under the surface. For one group of British scientists 2015 began with a bittersweet discovery. Images from Nasa’s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter revealed the fate of the Beagle 2 spacecraft. Not seen since Christmas 2003 when it parted from the European orbiter, Mars Express, the pictures showed the unmistakable Mickey Mouse-shaped remains of the little lander. Partially opened, its outer cover apparently nearby, the images showed how close the budget mission had come to success. “I had given up on ever knowing what happened to Beagle. After so many years you think you’ll never know,” said Mark Sims, the project’s mission manager at Leicester University. “It had obviously gone through its whole landing sequence and had started to deploy itself. When I first saw the images, I thought ‘My God, it might actually have made it’.” Facebook Twitter Pinterest An artist’s impression of Beagle 2. Photograph: European Space Agency/PA It was not the last we heard from Mars. In March, Nasa drew on the world’s most powerful telescopes to show that the red planet once hosted a vast, ancient ocean that covered nearly half of the northern hemisphere. That Mars had once been warm and damp was nothing new, but the amount of water was a revelation. The scientists envision the north of Mars under around 20 million cubic kilometres of water, more than is found in the Arctic ocean. The huge body of water stood for millions of years but as the atmosphere thinned the ocean was lost to space. What remains, a mere 13% of the water, is locked up in the planet’s polar ice caps. More breathtaking, though, was the finding in September that there is liquid water on Mars today. The Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, the same probe that found Beagle 2, had swung around the planet taking pictures of strange dark streaks that appeared on crater walls and canyons during the planet’s summer months. Infrared analyses of the images found the hallmarks of hydrated salts on the surface, but only when the streaks were present. It looked a sure sign that liquid water was either condensing on the surface, or rising up from the briny reservoirs in the ground. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Hale crater on Mars, showing Nasa’s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter signs of liquid water. Photograph: NASA/Getty Images Water is regarded as a prerequisite for life, or at least for life on Earth. The discovery that water flows on Mars means the planet may, in some parts, harbour niches where microbes evolved and exist even now. That would be in line with the discovery of methane plumes on Mars last year, though chemical reactions on rocks can release the same gas. The prospect is tantalising but the practicalities are frustrating. To find life elsewhere would answer one of the greatest questions of human existence. But there is a glitch. Planetary protection guidelines say that robotic landers must not spread Earthly microbes to sites where life might exist on other planets. Nasa’s Curiosity rover was not sterilised before launch and so is not clean enough to venture on to Mars’s damp patches. Nor is its twin, a rover planned for launch in 2020. It is a quandary that scientists may work around though. Trundle about on Mars for long enough and the radiation may kill off any microbes that hitched a ride. Expect more in 2016. “It looks more and more like Mars was a very habitable world three to four billion years ago,” said Monica Grady, professor of planetary science at the Open University. “What we don’t really know is: did life develop there? If you asked me 20 years ago I’d have bet heavily against the possibility of life. But nowadays we know Mars was a pretty habitable place. The question is: did it start and did it go anywhere?” Between Mars and Jupiter, a spacecraft named Dawn became the first to visit a dwarf planet. At 300 miles wide, Ceres is the largest object in the asteroid belt. As Dawn approached, two mysterious shiny spots became clear on the surface. The nature of the bright patches sparked a debate among astronomers, with the latest spectral images from the spacecraft suggesting they are not ice, as some suspected, but salts.

Photograph: Handout/ESA via Getty Images The European Space Agency’s Rosetta spacecraft, the first to drop a lander on a comet, continued to orbit the body, sniffing oxygen in its gas cloud and flying close enough to film its own shadow on the comet’s surface. The Philae lander which landed not once, but thrice, fell silent three days after touchdown. But as the comet neared the sun and more light fell on its solar panels, Philae stirred to life again, long enough to call Rosetta. The moment was the highlight of the year for Grady, who works on the Ptolemy instrument onboard. “It powered up and it could still happen again,” she said. For now, the comet is too active for Rosetta to fly close enough to make contact. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Cassini spacecraft image of Saturn’s moons Dione and Rhea. The distance between Dione and Rhea was roughly 330,000km (205,000 miles). Photograph: HO/Reuters Meanwhile, on the sixth moon of Saturn, Nasa’s veteran Cassini probe went looking for signs of life. The spacecraft dived down to Enceladus and passed through geysers that erupt from a saline ocean under the surface. Scientists are still analysing the chemicals detected in the plume. If they turn out to include hydrogen gas, researchers would have good evidence for hot vents at the bottom of the moon’s ocean and good reason to consider Enceladus the most promising place to find life beyond Earth. Orbiters and rovers have peered and poked at Mars for a long time. But other corners of the solar system had gone unexplored until this year. As John Bridges, a planetary scientist at Leicester University, puts it: “2015 was the year of the outer solar system.” It was an important year for images too. For 85 years, the best pictures we had of Pluto showed no more than a blurred blob. In July, the US space agency’s New Horizons probe changed all that. Barrelling past the dwarf planet on the edge of the solar system, the spacecraft captured Pluto in all its staggering beauty. “It’s opening up our view of the outer solar system,” Bridges said. “We have this idea of the outer solar system being this cold, inert place of dust and ice. But the key thing now, when we get a close-up view, is that there’s geological activity going on out there.” Inactive planets and moons are pocked with ancient impacts but active ones look different: the ground is turned over and refreshed. The Pluto images showed clear signs of activity in the form of giant regions of smooth, young terrain. “These are halcyon days for planetary science,” said Bridges. “There’s no question about that.” The year produced, a fine demonstration of the fates of space hardware. In April Nasa crashed its Messenger probe into Mercury once it was done mapping the planet. A month later, the Russian cargo ship, Progress 59, fell back to Earth after going wrong en route to the International Space Station.

Photograph: Craig Rubadoux/AP With ever more powerful telescopes on the ground and in space, astronomers added to the haul of thousands of planets spotted beyond our own solar system. One is Kepler 438b, claimed by Kepler mission scientists to be the most Earth-like planet found to date. But the alien world, which lies 470 light years away, is not the most habitable. Intense blasts of radiation from the planet’s host star are thought to have stripped the atmosphere, leaving the planet Earth-sized but less than Earth-like. The search for life beyond Earth took an extraordinary turn in October when an astronomer from Penn State University suggested that strange signals around a distant star might be the signature of a swarm of alien “megastructures” in orbit around the planet. In December the possibility, which was seriously speculative from the start, was dealt a blow. Scientists dedicated to the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (Seti) used an observatory in Panama to look for signs of life around the star and found none. Those impatient for contact with alien life should not lose heart though. The world’s most comprehensive search for ET begins in earnest in January with backing from Yuri Milner, the Russian internet billionaire. Backing the launch earlier this year, Stephen Hawking said: “Mankind has a deep need to explore, to learn, to know. We also happen to be sociable creatures. It is important for us to know if we are alone in the dark.”",diasaster:0},

Before Christmas he asked passengers to “bear with us over the Christmas period as we undertake this extensive improvement work to create a better railway for passengers and those living near to the railway line”. The honours are likely to come in for criticism at a time when Network Rail executives are under intense political pressure over the disruption, particularly the cancellation of services out of London King’s Cross. Mark Carne, the company’s chief executive, said on Tuesday that he would not take his bonus, having previously refused to say whether he would accept it. Carne, who earns £675,000 a year, had been in line for a £30,000 bonus this year but came under fire for being on holiday in Cornwall during the disruption on the network. “I am accountable for the railways and the performance [over Christmas] was not acceptable so I have decided that I should not take my bonus this year,” he told Sky News. He added that when he took over at Network Rail in January 2014 he recognised the railways faced enormous challenges and said these challenges remained. Other top executives at Network Rail are entitled to annual performance-related bonuses of up to 20% of salaries. Manuel Cortes, the leader of the TSSA rail union, said: “We welcome this decision by Mark Carne but, like many of his trains, it is running late – 72 hours late in this case. He should have announced it on Sunday when the level of chaos suffered by tens of thousands of passengers caught up in the King’s Cross shutdown became clear. We hope that his fellow executives will now follow suit and announce they will also be giving up their large bonuses as well.” Robin Gisby, Network Rail’s managing director of operations, who was responsible for the overrunning engineering work that caused the cancellation of all trains in and out King’s Cross on Saturday, is to forfeit a golden goodbye. Gisby had been due to receive a bonus of up to £371,000, but Network Rail said he would be leaving in February without any additional payment beyond that stipulated in his contract, in a deal agreed prior to the Christmas travel problems. A Network Rail spokeswoman said Carne had made a personal decision. On Monday Carne said he would probably be entitled to only about 5% but he refused to say whether he would be taking any bonus, despite being repeatedly pressed on the matter. Passengers continued to face disruption to rail and tube services . An overhead wire problem at Dunbar in Scotland meant disruption all day for those travelling with the CrossCountry, East Coast and ScotRail train companies. East Coast had a reduced service from Edinburgh to Newcastle, with possible delays. Services from London terminated at either Newcastle or Berwick-upon-Tweed, with replacement buses running from Newcastle to Edinburgh. Carne said he agreed with the transport secretary, Patrick McLoughlin, that the industry should conduct a wider review into whether it is wise to undertake so much engineering work in the Christmas or Easter period on the basis that fewer people travel during those times. McLoughlin came under pressure from Labour on Tuesday to explain whether he had properly examined Network Rail’s plans for closures. In a letter, Michael Dugher, the shadow transport secretary, asked him: “Did you or other ministers at the Department for Transport properly scrutinise the planned level of maintenance work over the Christmas period and raise any concerns? Were any assurances sought by ministers that the plans were robust enough and that there was sufficient resilience in the system to ensure that there would not be continued disruption into the weekend? Did ministers demand that adequate contingency plans be set in place for when failures like this occur?” Adding to the row, passengers will this week suffer an annual rise in fares that means some season ticket holders will have endured increases of more than 20% in the life of this parliament, according to figures from the Campaign for Better Transport. The latest rise takes effect on Friday and will see regulated fares, which include season tickets, increasing by up to 2.5% and fares overall going up by an average of 2.2%. • This article was amended on 31 December 2014 to make clear that David Ward was not responsible for the worst-affected services at King’s Cross during the Christmas travel problems. We have also been asked to make clear that Robin Gisby’s departure and severance package was agreed in November, and did not relate to the problems experienced at Christmas.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Two children and their mother die in Surrey mobile home fire", "content": "Two children and their mother have died in a fire at their mobile home. The woman’s husband and their son were treated for burns following the blaze at The Plantation in West Park Road, Newchapel, Surrey, during the early hours of Tuesday. The privately owned site, used by members of the Showmen’s Guild of Great Britain – travelling fairground operators – was in mourning on Tuesday following news of the deaths, the guild president, David Wallis, said. Wallis, 70, said he knew of the family and that the man and woman had been married for “quite some time”. He said he believed the children who died were aged one and five, and that the couple’s 10-year-old son was in hospital being treated for burns. “It’s a terrible thing and all the members of the guild throughout the country send their condolences out to the family.” Wallis said the guild’s benevolent fund would take care of the financial side of things and that two representatives were on their way to the site to help. He added that he had received phone calls from members across the country offering help. He said: “What can you do when there are children involved? We are a travelling fairground community, a regulated body and very well organised and accepted throughout the country. We are quite a close community and the families living on the site are all very close and will be looking after those affected.” Three crews from Surrey fire and rescue service were called to the blaze at 1.37am. A spokesman said: “Sadly, two children and one woman have died. A man and another child were also treated for burn injuries at the scene and the child has since been taken to East Surrey hospital. “Surrey fire and rescue service and Surrey police are carrying out a joint investigation and our thoughts are with the family and friends of those involved at this tragic time.” Surrey police said the scene remains cordoned off while inquiries are carried out into the cause of the fire. Police guards stood at entrances to the mobile home site, which is beside a busy main road. Two fire engines remained at the scene as officers stood blocking a public footpath running alongside the site. A Tandridge district council spokesman confirmed the site was privately owned and had been operating on the land for more than 20 years. He said: “Tandridge district council is aware of the tragic fire at The Plantation early this morning in which an adult and two children sadly lost their lives. We express our sympathies to other members of the family. “We understand that the fire and police services are currently investigating the circumstances of the fire. The council has no direct involvement in this investigation but will assist if our services are required in any way.”",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Rail campaigners angered as season ticket prices soar", "content": "This week’s annual fare rise will mean some season-ticket holders will have endured increases of more than 20% during this parliament, according to figures from the Campaign for Better Transport (CBT). The rise, effective from Friday, will see regulated fares, which include season tickets, increasing by up to 2.5% and fares overall up by an average of 2.2%. Those commuting to London from Milton Keynes in Buckinghamshire, for example, will have to contend with a 2.43% rise, with their 2015 ticket going up to £4,888. According to CBT, the cost of a Milton Keynes season ticket has risen 23.5%, or £930, since January 2010 and is one of a number of fares that have increased four times more than average wages over this five-year period. The CBT also highlighted the cost of a Newcastle to Middlesbrough season ticket, which will be £2,324 – up 26.3% since January 2010. Other examples of large increases on season tickets since January 2010 given by CBT are Ashford International to London (up 22%), Oxford-London (up 22%), St Albans-London (up 22%), Leeds-Sheffield (up 23.5%), Leicester-Derby (up 22.5%) and Bristol-Bath (up 22.4%). CBT said average wages had risen by 6.9% since January 2010. Its public transport campaigner, Martin Abrams, said: “Yet again, the government is hiking up commuter rail fares. Ticket prices are rising much faster than wages, which means getting to work takes up an increasing share of incomes, hitting both household budgets and the economy. “The government urgently needs to adopt a fairer approach to ticketing, bringing fares down and introducing more flexible tickets to help groups like the millions working part-time.” The rail union RMT has also criticised the fare rise, which comes at a time when commuters have had to contend with late autumn and early winter disruptions to rush-hour services. Last weekend, over-running Christmas engineering work led to chaotic scenes at King’s Cross, Paddington and Finsbury Park stations in London and threw the spotlight on Network Rail’s top bosses’ salary levels and bonus structure. Network Rail’s chief executive, Mark Carne, has since said he would not be taking his 2014/15 performance-related bonus that could have given him as much as 135,000. RMT has published figures which it said showed that UK taxpayers’ subsidy to the railways, on top of fares, totalled just over £4bn in 2012/13. The union’s general secretary, Mick Cash, said: “As the travelling public gear up for the new year fares hike, we are blowing away the myth that the extra cash is invested back into services when in fact it combines with taxpayer subsidies to fuel a £4bn privatised rail rip-off that is a one-way ticket to the bank for the train companies.” He said: “The scandal of the British people paying the highest fares in Europe to travel on clapped-out and overcrowded trains will be compounded by the new year average rise – an increase which dwarfs average pay increases and which will hit the poorest the hardest.” Cash said RMT would step up the fight for renationalisation of the railways. The January 2015 increase could have been even worse. For the second year running, the government limited the rise to the RPI inflation rate (based on the July 2014 figure) rather than the set annual-rise formula of RPI plus 1%. The government has also scrapped the “flex” rule which allowed some regulated fares to go up by 2% above the RPI rate as long as the average for all fares did not exceed the set formula. In previous years, the flex rule meant some fares could go up by more than 5% above the average. Patrick McLoughlin, the transport secretary, said: “We are investing in the biggest rail modernisation since the Victorian era and fares have a crucial role to play in funding these improvements. This is because building better infrastructure helps create jobs, building a stronger economy for us all. “We recognise passengers’ concerns about the cost of rail fares. This is why we have frozen them for the second year in a row. We are protecting passengers even further by stopping operating companies from increasing individual fares by up to 2% more.” Bruce Williamson of the campaign group Railfuture said: “Chancellor George Osborne has yet again frozen fuel duty for motorists and, with oil prices falling dramatically, motoring is becoming cheaper in real terms and rail travel becoming more expensive. “So don’t be surprised if road congestion gets even worse along with pollution, accidents and global warming.” He said: “Fares need to reflect reality in terms of inflation, and with the most recent figures for CPI inflation just 1% and falling, this represents yet another unfair squeezing of rail passengers’ wallets. “There’s a real danger that further fare increases will deter passengers from travelling and reduce the rail industry’s income, increasing the support required from government.”",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Easter eggs at Christmas? It’s just wrong", "content": "Silly question, I know, but did you by any chance come across an Easter egg at the bottom of your Christmas stocking? I only ask because hawk-eyed seasonal shoppers reported batches arriving in supermarkets a couple of weeks ago. The best Easter eggs, chocolate, hot cross buns and simnel cake – taste test Read more The suppliers, when asked whether this wasn’t a little premature – after all, we were still looking forward to Christmas at that point – said they liked to deliver chocolate eggs when they were fresh, and if this was before the holiday before, well, that was not their problem. But it is not just the arrival of chocolate eggs in midwinter that is disorientating. It probably did not escape you that, in the run-up to Christmas, traditional fruitcakes with marzipan and icing had to share the supermarket shelves not just with French-style bûches de Noël and German stollen, but with English hot cross buns. Perhaps you even toasted some yourself for a light breakfast yesterday morning, before the Christmas feast proper began. If so, good for you. Hot cross buns seem to have made the leap from Easter exclusive to year-round staple without outcry or fanfare. They are even being made in what might be regarded as more Christmas-y flavours. With mince pies in a dozen varieties on sale pretty much year-round too, plum pudding would seem to be almost the only Christmas speciality to have ducked the trend. For me, it is the accelerating decline of seasonal specificity in food that is more of a loss than the globalised menu The reason may be that despite the best efforts of Jamie Oliver and the rest to ease the workload for us – assembling the old-fashioned ingredients, stirring in the alcohol and even steaming the resulting assemblage to Goldilocks-style perfection – there remains a quorum that always detested Christmas pudding as children. Now they are grown up and the times have changed, they treat the leaden concoction more as a curiosity than a dessert: an ornament to be flamed without setting the house on fire, and then left to sit on the corner of the table – beyond the pavlova, the profiteroles and the pears in red wine – adorned with a sprig of holly. We can debate whether hot cross buns, either for Christmas or in a choice of flavours, are a good thing, and whether plum pudding deserves a return to popularity, or perhaps (dare one say) to die a death. I regret its relegation to optional extra. It is one of those dishes – bubble and squeak is another – whose chief purpose must surely have been to forge character. For me, though, it is the accelerating decline of seasonal specificity in food that is more of a loss than the globalised menu. You can have spiced buns at any time of the year, but hot cross buns – with their crosses of pastry, or simply indented with a knife (as we did at home) – belong to the week of Easter. Their origins may be lost in the mists of time – any connection with anything may be pagan or apocryphal – but they belong in a tradition. And, dogmatic though this may sound, there is only one flavour they ought to come in: original. As to culinary traditions and their seasonal place, I am with the mainland Europeans all the way. In France, the Christmas capons arrive in the shops only two or three weeks before the feast day; the bûches de Noël appear in the bakeries a little later. If for any reason – and few French people would see any reason at all – you fancy a dressed capon or a bûche at any other time of year, you will have a search on your hands. Similarly with the Epiphany cakes, galettes des rois,– which come with a gilded paper crown and a hidden china favour. If you don’t buy one by 6 January, you are going to have to wait another year. The same with the heavy baked cheesecake that accompanies Easter in Italy. I could go on. Alas, our laissez-faire attitude, so admirable in many ways – and so envied, especially by young people, across the Channel – has gone too far from that point where food meets tradition and time and place. I fear, though, that any resistance, though hardly begun, is already doomed.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"OK, maybe cyclists aren’t all bad – but the pedestrian’s lot is not a happy one today", "content": "Until a couple of years ago, I lived one block away from an uncontrolled T-junction. On the other side was a small Co-op supermarket, which was my closest shop. Getting to it was an almost-daily very short journey on foot. I don’t drive, by which I mean I can drive, but I wisely choose not to. I was last behind the wheel of a car in 1991, returning a rental to Boston airport, and only really drove in total for about a year before that, after passing my test in 1983, on the third go. It became clear that death would have less sting-a-ling-ling without me on the road, absent-mindedly going into the back of three parked cars, attention distracted by an election sign on a lawn. Thanks to astigmatism and terrible depth perception, I could never judge whether or not I had a large enough gap to change lanes. So I am, by choice, a pedestrian; a user of public transport; and late at night, having been mugged half a block from my front door a year ago, taxis. Thank god I moved, because getting to this shop could be a heart-stopping dice with death. T-junctions are a nightmare for a pedestrian to cross, because you have to look to your left and also behind you before you step off the pavement. The cars coming from the rear can’t see you until they are close to the turn, and they don’t always indicate if there’s no traffic behind them. To this difficulty has been added a new, frightening dimension: the cyclist, the most morally pure of road users, the ethical standard-bearer for healthy living, a challenge to climate change, and the ones who are starting to completely terrify me for their unpredictability and aggression. Are pedestrian fast lanes a good thing? Read more An incident from that T-junction illustrates the problem. The road is a busy one, wide enough for two lanes of cars in each direction. Two lanes of drivers saw me hovering on the pavement and slowed to allow me to cross. I got to just past the first set of cars when up through the centre came a cyclist, barrelling along at high speed, hunched over his handlebars, causing me to jump out of the way to avoid him, trip and go down flat on my face in the middle of the road. This sight didn’t deter the cyclist, who disappeared up road while two motorists got out of their cars to help me. No chance of getting the cyclist’s number plate, of course. They don’t have them. Why did he (there are female cyclists in London, but not as many) do this? I assume because he was trying to evade the cars, which is reasonable, given how many cyclist deaths are caused by larger vehicles; but pedestrians are not vehicles, and cyclist safety is coming at our expense. We are their most vulnerable competition, yet treated as if we don’t exist. Cyclists are behaving in ways that pedestrians cannot predict or understand or modify our behaviour to take into account. It’s an act of often-misplaced trust that they will do what they are supposed to do. Here is a traffic light. My sense is that drivers tend, overwhelmingly, to stop at them, but in a normal day of pedestrian road use I can repeatedly observe cyclists running red lights, and also coming up on to pavements scattering screaming passersby. A now-quaint cycling accessory, the bell, seems to have gone completely out of fashion – I can’t remember the last time I heard one, or saw a cyclist putting his arm out to indicate. I can’t ride a bicycle. As a child, I begged and nagged for one. I lived in a quiet suburb, and cycling around the neighbourhood would have been safe and healthy. In the early 60s it was a normal rite of passage for the 10-year-old to receive a bike for their birthday, but I never did. The reason for this was that, a decade earlier, my father had knocked over a cyclist. The accident had been deemed the bike-rider’s fault, and Dad was exonerated. “Cyclists are a menace on the roads,” he would shout when I pleaded with him for a bike. So I never learned to ride one in childhood, and when I tried as an adult, the falling off was too painful. Now I find myself turning into my father, muttering, “cyclists are a bloody menace on the roads”, or at least London roads, which are choked with competing types of traffic, HGV vehicles being the most intimidating, and pedestrians the most nakedly at everyone else’s mercy. Sabotage and hatred: what have people got against cyclists? Read more I’m aware that many – maybe most – cyclists are law-abiding and stop at red lights and don’t speed through T-junctions when pedestrians are crossing or ride on pavements, and that even terrible cyclists don’t kill pedestrians, but as Father Ted remarked about paedophile priests, “Say if there’s 200 million priests in the world and 5% of them are paedophiles, that’s still only 10 million.” The percentage of arsehole cyclists may be a minority, but it’s a minority large enough to make crossing roads an exercise in guesswork as to whether the one coming towards you recognises that you even exist. Not that pedestrians are without our daily transgressions. Walking diagonally across intersections, stepping out into traffic, wandering around with headphones on so we can’t hear cars coming: all of these are hazards to other road users. But only cyclists proclaim themselves to be standard-bearers for an ethical higher calling and mode of being, more suited to a Lycra-clad cult than simply a mode of transportation. Twitter trolls? On yer bike Having complained about cyclists before, on Twitter, I’m geared up, so to speak, for the assault that’s going to come at me from the cycling lobby. I’ve mercifully evaded, so far, the Twitter mob in full pitchfork-wielding frenzy; have not been called, as the two women candidates in this summer’s Labour leadership contest were repeatedly, a “witch” or “cunt”. Still, I have the expertise to know what to do with trolls, which is mute don’t block. Trolls assault complete strangers in order to get a reaction. They’re attention-seekers, and I know to my cost the consequences of engaging with that type. I once tried to get a blogger to correct something he had written about me that was simply factually inaccurate, an endeavour which went on, fruitlessly, for years. Trolls collect their blocked badges with pride, the distinction of possessing a voice so threatening that the powerful are trying to close it down. Being blocked by George Galloway or Louise Mensch or Alastair Campbell is a mark of speaking truth to power. The mute button is a far more subtle weapon, since the person on the other end doesn’t know that they have been muted and go on tweeting at you, often for years on end, in a state of complete invisibility. To be silenced is one thing, but to be ignored for your irrelevance is quite different, and more suited to those tweeters with seven followers and a death’s head and a pair of crossed saw-tooth knives as their avatar. Though I am Pollyannaish enough to believe that that would never be the assumed identity of a cyclist. I’m sure you’re all lovely when out of the saddle.",diasaster:0},

The strong wind was from the west, where, in the far distance, we could see the snow-capped tops of the hills. Much of the sea to our left was so dominated by the white foam that no water could be seen. With the tide ebbing, the rock pools on one side were exposed and here various waders were seeking not only food but shelter. Perhaps the weather had affected their behaviour – oystercatchers, purple sandpipers, redshank and turnstone were all mixed up in their search for food. Usually, along this stretch of coastline, these four waders keep together in small, loose groups whether feeding or roosting. The beaks of the different species vary in length, so that when they are probing for food they tend to find different food at varying levels. As we watched, white foam began to invade the rock pools but the waders paid no heed, not even when flecks of foam settled on their feathers. Above them, herring gulls were trying to make their way into the wind, perhaps seeking shelter around the headland in the harbour. The problem was that the higher the gulls rose in the attempt to move forward, the harder they were being driven back. In the end they just settled on the rocks as if giving up the battle. Country diary: Burghead, Moray Read more For once they were not out at sea, following the small groups of eider that this day were fishing, apparently oblivious to the elements. Normally herring gulls hover over the eiders’ feeding area, waiting for any fragments of food the ducks might leave. The wind had put paid to all that. Despite the weather, however, two of the drake eiders were displaying to the drab-looking females. I even thought I could hear the “ah-oo-oo” call notes that give them one of their Scots names – coo-doos – as it reminds people of the murmuring of doves.

{ "title":"Tania Rose obituary", "content": "My grandmother, Tania Rose, who has died aged 95, grew up speaking German but went on to collaborate with her husband on screenplays for Ealing Studios and the Oscar-winning Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner. Born Margaret Tatiana in Berlin, Tania was the daughter of Lisa (nee Balster) and Morgan Philips Price who, after reporting on the Russian Revolution for the Manchester Guardian, went as foreign correspondent to the Daily Herald. German was spoken at home, so Tania had to brush up on her English when the family moved back to Britain and settled at the Grove in Taynton. Her father later became Labour MP for the Forest of Dean and Father of the House of Commons. Tania and her brother, Peter, grew up on the family estate, where guests included Edward Elgar, George Bernard Shaw and Arthur Ransome. One day Tania accompanied Ransome on a fishing expedition to the nearby river Leadon, where he became so engrossed in the angling that he refused to speak to her, an occasion later immortalised in Ransome’s essay To Catch a Tench. Tania was educated at Cheltenham ladies’ college, which she hated, and sent to Vienna to study music in 1938, arriving just as the Germans annexed Austria and quickly returning to Britain. Shortly after, Tania met the university friends of her cousin, the historian Geoffrey Trevelyan, and was inspired to read history at Cambridge, completing the preparatory sixth-form course in a single year. On leaving Cambridge she was stationed at Woburn during the second world war, and in 1943 met and married an American, Bill Rose, who had come to Britain with the Canadian Black Watch. After the war, the couple lived in Scotland, Gloucestershire, Berkshire and London while Rose struggled to establish himself as a writer. After a spell at Ealing Studios, where Bill’s screenplay The Ladykillers (1955) was filmed, and the success of the films Genevieve (1953) and Touch and Go (1955), the family moved to Brighton, where Tania began to seriously collaborate with her husband, their professional partnership culminating in It’s a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World (1963). They then moved to Jersey, where they wrote Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner, which won the Academy Award for the best original screenplay in 1967. In all, their films were nominated for 13 major awards and also won a Bafta, an Edgar and three US Writers Guild prizes. After the couple separated, Tania returned to live in London in the autumn of 1967 and went to work as an information officer at the Race Relations Board, later the Commission for Racial Equality. She was appointed MBE for services to race relations in 1979. After retiring in 1980, Tania completed a PhD at Hull University and then edited two collections of her father’s letters, Despatches from the Revolution: Russia 1916-18 (1997) and Despatches from the Weimar Republic: Versailles and German Fascism (1999).

{ "title":"UK’s leading fund manager picks his stocks for 2015", "content": "Britain’s leading fund manager, Neil Woodford, has warned that falling oil prices could prompt a rout in the global bond market as shale companies default on vast debts built up during the US fracking boom. The extraordinary surge in shale oil production in the US has been largely financed by multibillion-dollar bonds issued on Wall Street and in the City. Fears are growing that independent drillers may now default on their $200bn (£130bn) in borrowings, creating a contagion in junk bond markets akin to the sub-prime mortgage collapse. Woodford said: “The full impact of the dramatic fall in oil prices is still unfolding. Clearly, some oil producing nations have been hit really hard – Russia, in particular, looks on the brink of a very serious crisis. But the problems are much more widespread – the US shale boom, for instance, is significantly threatened. Much of US shale production is not economic at current oil prices and the sell-off in junk bonds reflects the degree to which the shale boom has been financed by debt, much of which now may not be repaid.” Bonds issued by shale oil companies make up 15% of all “high-yield” or junk bonds in the US, having grown from virtually zero five years ago. The bonds were much sought after by institutions such as pension funds wanting higher interest rates than those on offer from more conventional corporate and government bonds. The alarm sounded by Woodford, seen as one of the most astute investors of his generation, adds to a warning by the Bank of England in its half-yearly assessment of dangers to the financial system. Mark Carney, the Bank governor, said falling oil prices were a net positive for the economy. But he added: “The risk around oil prices only really starts to become material if they breed further contagion.” A sell-off in energy bonds could also have a knock-on effect on the wider junk bond market. The credit rating agencies, whose reputation was shredded when they failed to spot the systemic risks posed by sub-prime mortgage securities, have also been highlighting the dangers in the energy bond market. Most of the bonds have been issued by small and medium-sized drillers, rather than the oil majors, and few have the financial reserves to maintain payments if the oil price fails to pick up or slides further. On Tuesday, the benchmark North Sea Brent oil was trading at around $57 a barrel, a five-year low. Among the most exposed bonds are those issued by firms that transport oil, which, according to rating agency Moody’s, have fewer investor safeguards than conventional bonds, known as “covenant lite” in trading circles. Debt research firm CreditSights Inc is predicting a doubling in defaults next year. Woodford is also warning investors to steer clear of the oil majors, such as BP and Shell, in 2015. “I have avoided the oil majors for some time – some have high yields which I believed were unsustainable when oil was priced above $100 per barrel. At current oil prices, dividends from the oil majors are at risk. These companies will either have to cut capex [capital expenditure] substantially further, and by implication future growth, or the dividend – neither option looks particularly good news for shareholders.” Woodford presided over £30bn in investors’ cash while at Invesco Perpetual before starting his own boutique investment house, Woodford Funds, which has swiftly built up £8bn in assets since launching in June. His outlook for 2015 includes: • A prediction that tobacco company shares will continue to outperform. “Tobacco stocks are prominent in my portfolio principally because the market continues to profoundly undervalue their dependable qualities,” Woodford said. “The fund has a number of holdings – British American Tobacco, Imperial Tobacco and Reynolds American. The demand for their products is very consistent and predictable; they aren’t capital intensive businesses; they generate lots of cash; they pay sustainable and growing dividends; they don’t have to worry about new entrants; and they have significant pricing power. “These businesses are made for the current environment – they can continue to grow despite the tricky economic conditions we are likely to experience over the next few years. This isn’t so much a call about prospects for 2015, because my investment horizons are significantly longer than that. My conviction in the investment case is much greater on a five- to 10-year view.” • Energy, banks and mining remain no-go areas. “I have little or no exposure to sectors such as energy, banks and mining. All of these industries face a very challenging future in terms of cash flows and ultimately dividends which, in my view, isn’t yet fully reflected in share prices. “I remain unconvinced of the investment attractions of the more mainstream high street banks. I sold HSBC in August over concerns about ‘fine inflation’ in the banking industry and I don’t think that story has fully played out yet. Meanwhile, the likes of RBS and Lloyds (which I haven’t held for a very long time) still look many years away from paying sustainable dividends.” But in early December, Woodford became a cornerstone investor in an online bank startup which is expected to launch in the second half of 2015. “I recently invested in Atom Bank, a new ‘challenger’ bank with a purely digital business model. “In some ways it’s similar to my own business here at Woodford Investment Management in that it has started with a clean slate and because of that is freed from the burden of legacy infrastructure costs. Atom is a very small position in the overall portfolio, however.” • It’s not the time to go back into Tesco. “Tesco has fallen a long way but it still represents a pretty risky proposition, in my view, as does the wider sector. Tesco has faced its own set of internal issues and is probably now doing the right things to put them right, but history suggests that resolving them will take a long time. “More broadly, the food retail industry still suffers from over-capacity in my view and continues to face increased competition from discounters such as Aldi and Lidl, falling food prices, and the risk of a prolonged spell of margin pressure.

{ "title":"Labour accused of class war by top private school head", "content": "The vast majority of the “educational apartheid” in Britain is caused not by private schooling but by parents buying their way into catchment areas for the best state schools, according to the first male president of the body representing independent girls’ schools. Alun Jones, who takes over as president of the Girls’ Schools Association (GSA) on 1 January, accused Labour of returning to “70s class war” in its plan to limit tax breaks for independent schools. He argued the capacity to buy an expensive home near an excellent school represented greater privilege than a decision to make “huge sacrifices” to pay for private education. “Eighty per cent of the educational apartheid that we see is actually due to geographical location,” said Jones, who is also principal of St Gabriel’s school in Newbury, in an interview with the Guardian. “What’s the most privileged – being able to afford a £750,000 house and live in a catchment that takes you to what is defined as an excellent state school, or parents who want to make huge sacrifices and choose to opt for the independent sector?” The notion that private schools are elite is outdated, he argued. A survey released in August by Lloyds Bank found parents were ready to pay a premium averaging £21,000 and rising to almost half a million pounds for a home in a desirable catchment area. Schools in some areas, including parts of London, now operate lottery systems to address the inequality of admission by postcode. In November, the shadow education secretary, Tristram Hunt, unveiled Labour’s plans to cut tax breaks for private schools unless they do more to help children from the state sector. Independent schools would lose access to their 80% business rate relief, worth about £165m a year, unless they met a new “schools partnership standard”. Jones accused the party of “harking back to 70s social class war” and basing the policy on “ill-informed, outdated and patronising” ideas about the independent sector. He claimed nine out of 10 private schools were involved in some sort of partnership or collaboration with state counterparts, though the scale depended on resources available. His school provides free Latin lessons for two local state sixth forms and manages an athletic track where facilities are used jointly with the state partner, though it does not have the funds to sponsor an academy, Jones said. Meanwhile, more than £63m was awarded annually by the GSA in means-tested bursaries, with half of recipients paying less than half fees. Labour’s proposed new body to monitor such partnerships would merely be a quango monitoring what is happening, and a waste of taxpayers’ money, he added. However, Labour argues that while some private schools are working hard to create real links with state partners, most are providing merely token benefits such as occasional use of a sports field or facility and must face tax penalties if they do not raise their game. Jones accused Labour of adopting a “condescending attitude” but insisted he too wanted to see a breaking down of barriers between state and private schools. “One of the things I am really hoping to achieve as president is to get rid of the words ‘school type’ from the education language. I want us to talk about educating children and the fact that we all run great schools. What we are offering is a diverse range of schools serving a diverse range of children.” Hunt rejected Jones’s claims. “There is more to be done to share facilities, insights and expertise between the state and private sectors. We would not be setting up any new quangos,” he said. “We will ask the independent schools inspectorate to ensure that exactly the type of successful partnership St Gabriel’s has developed is emulated across the sector.” Jones said: “Girls’ schools aren’t pink and fluffy: there is no cap on what you can achieve. You won’t do needlework and play the flute.” However, he predicted far more mergers and collaboration between girls’ and boys’ schools in the next two decades, with a particular growth in the so-called “diamond model”, which sees girls and boys educated together until 11, taught in separate classes from 11 to 16 (either within the same institution or separately), and then returning to co-education in the sixth form. “It’s an incredibly successful model which we will most certainly see grow,” said Jones, who said teenage girls educated separately were more likely to opt for non-stereotypical subjects, while boys would not be intimidated by high-achieving girls. Jones argues his gender is irrelevant to his desire to extend opportunities in education and the workplace for girls, he added, though his selection “just shows how outward-looking and modern we are”. Jones also joined many fellow heads in lamenting the impact social media can have on the well-being of pupils. Schools needed to work closely in partnership with parents, who should take phones and other electronic media away from youngsters before bedtime to ensure “quality down time”, he said. Parents should also be sure to know the passwords of their children’s Facebook and other accounts and ensure the youngsters knew they could potentially access them.",diasaster:0},

David Anderson QC, the independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, said: “There are acute concerns within the charitable sector regarding banks withdrawing or curtailing services to NGOs [non-governmental organisations]. I welcome any report that seeks to address these concerns.” The problems faced by charities have not been heightened by claims that Islamic State (Isis) and other terrorist groups have used good causes as a cover for their own funding.

This isn’t an anthropology of believers – that would be a work of ages. But it is still a huge advance on what has been before.

{ "title":"US travel ban leaves Iranian LGBT refugees in limbo", "content": "Gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender refugees from Iran have found themselves caught between a rock and a hard place after Donald Trump’s executive order banning entry for people from seven Muslim-majority countries. US travel ban puts 20,000 refugees in 'precarious circumstances', UN says Read more The order also suspended the US refugee admissions system for 120 days, and promised to prioritise members of religious minorities. But it made no mention of people facing persecution for their sexual orientation, and several gay Iranians who have fled a country where homosexuality is punishable by death are now left stuck in Turkey, where they say they are experiencing worse homophobic abuses than in their homeland. Some of the refugees have already had their asylum applications approved by the UN refugee agency and were due to be resettled in the US after months or even years of interviews and security checks. Mitra, a 27-year-old lesbian living in Denizli, a conservative city in south-west Turkey, left Iran in 2014 after receiving death threats because of her activities as the editor of Aghaliat, an online magazine focusing on LGBT issues. She was granted refugee status by the UN nearly two years ago, and was due to attend her final interview this month before being resettled in the US. “They have just called me and said it’s all cancelled,” she said. Until Trump’s ban came into force, the US was the only viable path to safety for gay Iranians who end up in Turkey. Canada no longer accepts them because it is focusing on Syrian refugees. European countries do not normally accept LGBT Iranians who have applied from Turkey. Like many of her fellow minorities, Mitra was initially approved to go to Canada. “I waited for 14 months, [and] even went through the medical checks but one day they called and said Canada doesn’t accept Iranians anymore and I should go to the US. Now that’s up in the air too.” Mitra added: “One by one all my dreams and hopes are being destroyed before my eyes. It doesn’t matter to me whether to go to Canada or the US, I just want to go somewhere – anywhere – safe.” Mitra currently lives with her partner in a tiny room with one sofa that is also their bed. “Iran doesn’t want us, Canada doesn’t want us and now the US doesn’t want us either. I have seen the suicide of three friends since 2015. A gay Iranian [threw] himself off a balcony and an Iranian lesbian hanged herself just eight months ago.” She argued that the US should also make exemptions for sexual minorities as well. “At least with religious refugees, they have the support of their families, we don’t even have that. Our families are [ashamed] of us.” Javad, 50, is a disabled Iranian gay man also living in Turkey. “I was abandoned by my family, I was abandoned by my country and now I [do not] have anywhere to go,” he said. He said two of his friends were beaten up in the street. “One day a friend of mine, an Iranian gay name Pouya, called and said, ‘forgive me’,” he said. “I realised he was about to take his life. “I am disabled, I struggled to get to his house, by the time I got there he had died. He had just had enough.” Saghi Ghahraman, the head of the Canada-based Iranian Queer Organisation, said LGBT Iranians face horrific punishment and bullying. A fatwa issued in 1987 by the late Ayatollah Khomeini legalised transexuality, but social stigma remains still rampant, and homosexuality is still punishable by death. “Up until 2013, the wait-time for the LGBT to be determined and resettled by the [UN high commissioner for refugees] in Turkey was about a year and a half, which was barely manageable,” she said. “But it changed with the war in Syria, and when the USA and Canada undertook resettlement of large number of displaced Syrians, the LGBT wait-time before resettlement went up to three years,” she said. Meanwhile, gay Iranian exiles have been subjected to a string of violent hate attacks and murders in Turkey, said Ghahraman. The 26-year-old Azad, a gay Iranian who was approved for relocation by the UN 23 months ago, said his friend fainted in the bus when he heard about Trump’s decision. “We’re stuck, we can’t go forward, we can’t go backward,” he said. “Turkey is so unstable too these days and anything can happen, what if they deport us back to Iran?”",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"UK house price growth has hit 14-month low, says Nationwide", "content": "UK house prices grew at their weakest annual rate in more than a year in January, in an early sign of the property market slowdown predicted for 2017. Annual growth edged down from 4.5% in December to 4.3%, according to the mortgage lender Nationwide. It was the weakest since November 2015. On a monthly basis, the average price of a UK home edged up 0.2%, to £205,240, following a 0.8% rise in December. Robert Gardner, Nationwide’s chief economist, said there were indications the housing market would soften in 2017, as household budgets come under pressure from higher consumer inflation at a time of weaker jobs and wage growth. UK housing market falters as estate agents become less optimistic Read more “The outlook for the housing market remains clouded, reflecting the uncertainty surrounding economic prospects more broadly,” Gardner said. “On the one hand, there are grounds for optimism. The economy has remained far stronger than expected in the wake of the Brexit vote. However, there are tentative signs that conditions may be about to soften. “The economy is likely to slow through 2017 as the squeeze on household budgets intensifies and heightened uncertainty weighs on business investment and hiring.” Nationwide predicts that growth in house prices will more than halve in 2017 to 2% from 4.5% in 2016. Howard Archer, the chief UK economist at IHS Markit, said conditions for house buyers were likely to deteriorate progressively during 2017. Inflation has already started to rise as the impact of the sharp fall in the value of the pound since the EU referendum feeds through to prices. A weaker pound makes imports from abroad more expensive. The headline rate UK inflation jumped to a two-and-a-half-year high of 1.6% in December from 1.2% in November, and is expected to rise to about 3% in the coming months. Looking back at trends over the last 60 years, Nationwide said the biggest gains in real house prices – comparing how much faster house prices have increased compared with goods and services more generally – were made in the 2000s. “These increases were spurred by a combination of strong and stable economic growth, a structural decline in interest rates and the further liberalisation of the financial system,” Gardner said. “In the decades ahead, real house price trends will continue to depend crucially on developments in the wider economy, though there is an even greater degree of uncertainty around this than usual.”",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Frequent 999 callers cost NHS millions of pounds a year", "content": "Ambulance “frequent fliers” who make several 999 calls a year are costing the NHS in England millions of pounds, with experts concerned that some patients develop an unhealthy pattern of dependent behaviour on the service. Though most callers have genuine unmet medical needs – few are malicious or hoaxers – the scale of the problem becomes evident as hospital A&E departments get to grips with another winter of rising demands on services. Ambulance service leaders and local health commissioners are keen to focus increasingly tight budgets on patients at more imminent risk. Mental health linked to one-fifth of emergency ambulance callouts Read more Among more extreme cases reported by ambulance services are: A patient who called 999 more than 700 times in two years. The estimated costs to the ambulance service over a year was more than £110,000. A patient who cost NHS England £10,000 in a month. A patient who made 238 emergency calls over two months at a cost of nearly £40,000. The London ambulance service says each patient costs on average £7.81 per 999 call. To be further reviewed on the telephone by a clinician costs £64.59, to receive an ambulance and be treated at home is £155.30, and to receive an ambulance and be taken to hospital costs £254.57. Frequent callers – a term preferred within 999 services to “fliers” – include people with chronic, often multiple conditions, mental health issues, high levels of anxiety, lack of confidence in managing their own problems, and people who feel socially isolated and may be seeking attention. Frequent callers are defined nationally as people who make more than five calls in a month or 12 in three months, although figures provided by individual ambulance services are sometimes based on different definitions. NHS clinical commissioning groups and ambulance services across England have embarked on a programme to change that behaviour. An experienced paramedic at the ambulance dispatch centre helps crews on the scene determine whether they should provide advice on the spot, refer the caller to other services or take them to hospital. This person also phones doctors at GP practices to discuss patients’ clinical conditions and support crews in considering alternatives to A&E. What I'm really thinking: the 999 operator Read more Louise Lumby, a GP involved in the scheme, said some frequent callers were genuinely very ill. She said: “Telling somebody off doesn’t change behaviour. It is about finding the right service for that patient. I would like to think we have a much better patient journey to care on the back of the fact we have put support in.” North West ambulance service identified 1,456 frequent callers in 2014-15. “Some patients are unaware of what else to do, or who to ring for help, and although we cannot always provide the care they require, patients know that we will respond”, it said. “Several patients have unmet care needs, are lonely and may have multiple complex needs that necessitate a multidisciplinary approach to support their health and social care needs appropriately. “Collaborative working and involving the patient in decision making is vital to ensure that patients are involved, that care is personalised and that each care provider is aware of all input. Unfortunately, support offered is not always accepted, and some patients refuse to engage, and will continue to ring 999.” Rob Cole, consultant paramedic with the West Midlands ambulance service, said the problem was “getting worse in terms of numbers but that is offset by the fact we are considerably better at the management [of the problem]”. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Ambulance services want to focus tight budgets on patients at greater risk. Photograph: Yui Mok/PA South Western ambulance service received 13,231 calls from frequent callers between June and August 2015. It said: “It is important to acknowledge the difference between inappropriate frequent callers and appropriate frequent callers. For example, a patient with unstable angina, end-stage COPD [chronic obstructive pulmonary disease] or a terminal illness meets the definition of a frequent caller but will have regular contact with us for a genuine acute need. “We work closely with other agencies, including our GP and hospital emergency department colleagues to jointly manage [them]. Since April 2013, we have only issued eight ‘restricted send’ letters to those frequent callers that we have identified as inappropriate callers that we cannot manage in other ways.” London ambulance service put into special measures Read more “Restricted send” letters tell patients that the service would no longer send an ambulance in response to a 999 call “other than in exceptional circumstances where clinical staff believe that your life is in imminent danger”. They also say that having worked unsuccessfully with them and other agencies “we have no other option but to take steps to protect other members of the public who do require our service”. Jason Scott, a research associate at Newcastle University’s Institute of Health and Society, who previously chaired the frequent caller network, is preparing a case for NHS research into the issues. The number of people calling “to be a nuisance” was small and could be dealt with through the legal process, he said. But work was needed to identify why others were frequently calling 999, said Scott. “The general agreement is that they are doing so because they have some form of perceived unmet health or social care need and the ambulance call is a fall-back position, the last resort,” he said. Detailed research was needed on whether cutting the number of frequent 999 callers caused problems elsewhere. Scott said: “Do we simply pass costs on to another part of healthcare, which doesn’t really solve the problem? That would be just passing the buck to someone else.”",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"The Guardian view on old buildings: memory banks of past glories", "content": "Whether the departure is from a home or an office, there is often something melancholy about saying farewell to a place pregnant with memories. The Washington Post has only moved a few blocks to 13th and K Street NW this month, but for the generation of journalists who spent most of their working lives in the unlovely but iconic Post building at 15th and L Street, the move is such a moment, the end of an era and a reminder of the transience of things – in this case the transience of the days when newspapers were inner-city print factories. In an unsentimental world, the old Post building is being reduced to rubble, while a swanky new piece of more modern real estate will soon rise in its place. But this was where, over months and years, two young reporters pieced together the most famous of all 20th-century journalistic investigations. The unravelling of the Watergate burglary’s White House connections, led by the Post’s Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein and robustly protected by editor Ben Bradlee and owner Katherine Graham, climaxed in the one and only resignation of a US president in 1974. It elevated investigative journalism to an unprecedented position of global esteem, in whose reflected glow we all still bask a little. The demolition of the Post’s famous open-plan newsroom is a glumly well-trodden path for industrial-era newspapers. After nearly a century, in 1970 the Guardian left its own Victorian offices in Manchester’s Cross Street on a journey to becoming a digital news organisation based in London, New York and Sydney, and publishing not each morning but every minute of every day. The Times, abandoning Printing House Square in 1974, did something similar in London. Both buildings were promptly demolished. The Scotsman, by contrast, moved out of its marble-staircased headquarters on Edinburgh’s North Bridge at the end of the 20th century but the buildings are now a hotel. Visitors can sleep in luxury where hot metal type was once expertly assembled. In the centres of formerly industrial cities are a multiplicity of buildings whose original function has become redundant or has developed in new ways. Railway stations, once embodiments of urban modernity and what Tony Judt called “neo-ecclesiastical monumentalism”, have become art galleries, as in Paris’s Quai d’Orsay, or conference centres, like Manchester Central. Corn exchanges like the one in Leeds, modelled on the Paris Bourse, have not seen a grain of wheat traded in decades. Manchester’s Free Trade Hall, where suffragettes once heckled Sir Edward Grey and where Sir John Barbirolli made the Halle into one of the great orchestras of the world, is now a hotel. Department stores that were the focus of a city, like Lewis’s in Liverpool with its Jacob Epstein statue over the entrance, now a Lidl, and Newcastle’s art deco Co-operative store, another hotel these days, are places of civic ghosts and memories too. Bank buildings have become bars. Football grounds have been turned into prestige housing. All things must pass. Buildings that have outlived their purpose have no right to be preserved perpetually in a Prince Charles-style attempt to stop the clock on history. Sentimentality about an imagined past is a British disease. For all that, the emotional link between a building like the Washington Post’s and the people who once worked there will live on, for years to come.",diasaster:0},

{ "title":"Married gay priest Jeremy Davies: ‘The bishops say we’re not modelling teachings of the church. Yes we are’", "content": "Christmas is a time of little rest for priests, and Jeremy Davies is no exception. He took midnight mass on Christmas Eve in his local church – the stunning Wren-designed All Saints’ in Farley, Wiltshire – followed by two morning services there and at another nearby church on Christmas Day. Although he retired four years ago, Davies is delighted still to be leading congregations in worship and officiating at weddings, christenings and funerals in the Church of England, to which he has devoted his life. “You don’t stop being a parish priest when you retire,” he says. “I hope I’ll go on until I’m gaga.” Gay clergyman banned from taking services after marrying partner Read more That, however, is far from guaranteed. A year ago, Davies married his partner of 28 years, Simon McEnery. It was the second time the couple had publicly affirmed their love and mutual commitment: they entered a civil partnership 10 years ago, on Davies’s 60th birthday. But their wedding vows – to love and cherish one another, for better and for worse, until death does them part – have put them at odds with the church’s teaching that marriage can only be between a man and a woman. This has already resulted in Davies being banned from taking church services a few miles away in the neighbouring diocese of Winchester. Meanwhile, illustrating the C of E’s gay marriage postcode lottery, the bishop of Salisbury – Davies’s own diocese – merely rapped his knuckles with an obligatory letter of rebuke. As messages of support from within and outside the church have poured into the couple’s home – a converted Methodist chapel eight miles from Salisbury cathedral, where Davies worked for 30 years – he and McEnery have found their own responses to the ecclesiastical fallout of their marriage diverging. Over salmon pasta and a glass of wine in their bright kitchen, crammed with Christmas cards and the detritus of everyday life, McEnery describes bishop Tim Dakin’s refusal to grant Davies “permission to officiate” in the diocese of Winchester as “an affront and an insult. It says to Jeremy: your 40-plus years of ministry are worth nothing.” He defiantly posted news of the bishop’s confidential decision on Facebook. “I think the church needs a damn good jolt,” he adds. I don’t need to be angry, because there are so many people feeling angry on our behalf Jeremy Davies Davies, meanwhile, has faced the ban – and his disagreement with his husband about exactly how to handle it – with equanimity. “I don’t need to be angry, because there are so many people feeling angry on our behalf. One of the good things [about the decision] is that it may encourage people to think again.” Gay vicars, of course, are nothing new. But for centuries, the C of E generally took a “don’t ask, don’t tell” approach. That has unravelled as social attitudes towards homosexuality have liberalised, accompanied by changes to the law over the last half century: decriminalisation in 1967, the introduction of civil partnerships in 2005, and marriage equality in 2014. As a result, the church has been plunged into tortured debate over the issue, which has threatened to split the wider Anglican communion amid theological wrangling and bitter accusations of homophobia and discrimination. The C of E’s position is this: clergy are permitted to enter into same-sex civil partnerships, so long as they give assurances that the relationship is celibate. Same-sex marriage is banned for clergy, as the church defines marriage as a lifelong union between a man and a woman. But, in recognition of the “new reality” of legal and social change, the archbishops of Canterbury and York have committed the church to “a process of facilitated conversations” around human sexuality and interpretations of the scriptures. So, although many senior church figures want the “bedroom issue” to go away, allowing them to focus on what they see as Christian priorities of social action, pastoral care and spreading the word of God, it is likely to dominate for some time to come. Meanwhile, much of secular society regards the C of E’s agonised convolutions on a scale ranging from bemusement to derision. As the debate on homosexuality rages among theologians, primates, bishops and members of the C of E’s synod, the consequences of the church’s stance reverberate in real life. Love is constrained, commitment is tested; many relationships are unable to withstand such challenges. Fortunately for Davies and McEnery, now 69 and 51 respectively, their relationship is robust and, indeed, has been reinforced by such trials. They listen to one another and laugh at familiar jokes; disagreements, when they come, are genial. The pair met at a party in Salisbury in 1987. Davies had moved to the medieval city two years earlier, to take up the ancient post of canon precentor at Salisbury cathedral. McEnery was struggling to ground his life amid confusion about his sexuality and professional future. By the time they were introduced, Davies had already fallen in love with the younger man’s voice, having heard a recording of his singing. Jeremy Davies, C of E priest and former canon precentor at Salisbury cathedral. Davies also had a musical background. He was brought up in Cardiff, as a Welsh-speaking Baptist until the age of seven, when he was baptised into the Anglican church. He became a chorister at Llandaff cathedral, followed by Hurstpierpoint College, a public school he readily acknowledges as elitist, but where he gained a first-class education and the opportunity to develop his passions for music, drama and rugby. From there, he read English literature as a choral scholar at Corpus Christi College, Cambridge. He had long been certain his future lay with the church. “I was taken with religion at an early age. I can’t really explain it, but I was caught by it, I loved it.” As a small child, he preached sermons to his sisters and dispatched himself to three different Sunday schools each week. “I knew I was going to be a priest.” As he grew older and came to understand his sexual orientation, he also grappled with the “question of whether you could be a priest and be homosexual at the same time. But I’m a great optimist; I believe there’s always a way through; things can be reconciled. And things were beginning to change.” Social attitudes were relaxing, and the 1967 Sexual Offences Act, which decriminalised homosexuality, was passed while Davies was at Cambridge. “There was a background noise which encouraged me to think theology couldn’t, and wasn’t, standing still. It was a very exciting time.” The abstract questions became real when he fell in love for the first time, while studying theology after Cambridge in preparation for priesthood. “It made me realise that I needed to take my sexuality into my theology, otherwise I’d be a very emasculated priest. If you couldn’t take half of what you were into a ministry, what kind of ministry would it be? A very dishonest ministry.” Nobody cared really, except within the church where people are much more worked up than in society at large Simon McEnery The relationship lasted a couple of years before the two incipient priests were parted by geography. Davies took jobs in London and Cardiff before moving to Salisbury and meeting McEnery, the son of a Church of England vicar, who had recently come out as gay after years of sexual confusion. “I was still very wary; I didn’t know how to conduct such a relationship,” says Davies. “After all, I was the precentor of Salisbury cathedral; I wasn’t going to flaunt my sexuality, I didn’t want to become known as the gay priest. “At first we’d go to concerts and sit separately, and Simon went along with this extraordinary collusion with the norms of the church. But, by degrees, it was he who helped me come to terms with this as a good and Godly thing to be relished and enjoyed, and we shouldn’t be ashamed of it.” After McEnery completed his studies in singing and jazz at London’s Guildhall School of Music and Drama, the couple began living together. “People just got used to us being around,” says Davies; he had a run-in with a dean over their cohabitation “but I basically told him where to go”. According to McEnery, “nobody cared really, except within the church where people are much more worked up than in society at large”. Gay couples were permitted to register their relationships as civil partnerships from 21 December 2005. Seventeen days later, Davies and McEnery signed the papers and threw a party to celebrate with friends and colleagues. Davies informed the then bishop of Salisbury about his new status, and volunteered an assurance that the relationship complied with church requirements on sexual activity. Now he regrets having offered that assurance. Pointing out that what constitutes sexual activity is different for each individual and in each relationship, he adds: “The whole process seems untruthful. Why should I collude with a dishonest intrusion into a private relationship? I don’t see that a sexual relationship is incompatible with a loving relationship, whether it’s between people of the same gender or not. So in fact to give that assurance was, I think, colluding with the system. It shouldn’t have happened.” When it became legally possible to marry, Davies was hesitant. “I resisted it. I thought a partnership is fine, but you can’t have a marriage between two men or two women. Simon was all in favour of same-sex marriage, and I was against it. I had to be persuaded. I began to look again at the marriage service. And I thought the theology of marriage is not about a man and a woman.” Facebook Twitter Pinterest Jeremy Davies and Simon McEnery. The marriage vows, he says, are about mutual society, human relationships. “And why shouldn’t two men or two women, who love each other and want to commit their lives to each other for ever, say these things? When the bishops said that clergy who enter into same-sex marriages are not modelling the teaching of the church – yes we are. It is embodied in that vow.” The mutual society between Davies and McEnery is evident in their daily lives. “We’re an awful middle-class cliche,” says McEnery, referring to their Waitrose shopping, holidays in Madeira, outings to the opera and theatre, and addiction to the afternoon TV quiz show Pointless. Davies sings in the Salisbury Chamber Chorus, which is conducted by McEnery. The house is filled with books, paintings and the smell of freshly brewed coffee. Just inside their front door hangs the figure of Jesus impaled on a crucifix; by their kitchen door hangs a raunchy gay calendar. Matching blue Peugeots are parked outside. Both men appear supremely content with the life they have built together. But there are differences: Davies, who will be 70 in January, has quietly reconciled his faith and sexuality, whereas McEnery – who “gave up on God” 15 years ago – verges on contempt for an institution he feels has cruelly rebuffed the couple. The bishop of Winchester took five months to respond to Davies’s request for his permission to officiate at services in the diocese, made after mounting requests for the priest to help out in stretched parishes over the county border. Dakin’s letter, and a media statement issued after the refusal became public, referred to the House of Bishops’ pastoral guidance on same-sex marriage. Britain's only openly married gay vicar elected to Church of England synod Read more It says: “The Church of England affirms, according to our Lord’s teaching, that marriage is in its nature a union … of one man with one woman.” Same-sex weddings in church “will not be possible”, it adds. And “it would not be appropriate conduct for someone in holy orders to enter into a same-sex marriage, given the need for clergy to model the Church’s teaching in their lives.” “Perhaps I was naive. I thought it would be a formality,” concedes Davies, who at the time was unaware of Dakin’s views or “possible prejudices”. He hopes to meet the bishop early in 2016 to discuss the reasons behind the refusal. He will also need to renew his permission to officiate in the diocese of Salisbury when it expires, and may seek permission to officiate elsewhere. Whether or not he can continue to carry out his duties as a priest remains to be seen. Through it all, the clergyman retains a remarkable magnanimity. I think [Dakin] is behind the curve,” he says, “but it’s a legitimate curve to be on. The church is on the move, but it takes a long time. This is very frustrating to many people, but the issue of sexuality in human relationships has been on the church’s agenda for 2,000 years.” In the end, whatever the theological contortions the church is putting itself through, Davies comes back to a simple principle. Same-sex marriage, he says, “is not about putting two fingers up to the bishops or the Church of England. It’s what people who love each other and want to commit to a long-term relationship do.”",diasaster:0},

Armed with his trusty Nikon camera, Wang Wei has hiked up to the frosty Tibetan plateau and across the Gobi desert; he has journeyed to a tropical island in the South China Sea and to China’s remote border with Pakistan – all to satisfy his inexplicable urge to photograph trains. “I never get tired. You don’t get tired if you are doing something you feel truly passionate about,” says Wang, who at 24 has already built a personal archive of hundreds of thousands of photographs of trains. China’s No 1 trainspotter, who grew up just next to Beijing’s Xizhimen station and still lives with his parents, believes he was born with a fascination for ferroequinology. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Xiangyu railway in central China. Photograph: Wang Wei​ His great-grandfather was a train driver who once transported Wu Peifu, a warlord whose exploits in early 20th-century China earned him a place on the cover of Time magazine alongside the headline: “Biggest man in China”. “I think there might be a love for trains in my blood,” confesses Wang, whose bedroom walls are covered with his photographs of trains from around China. His train hunting mission – which he officially launched in 2005 – has coincided with one of the most spectacular bursts of railway construction in history; an immense engineering project that some compare to the 19th-century railway boom that helped make the US the world’s leading economy. In 2006, the year after Wang’s expedition began, China opened the highest railway line on Earth, finally fulfilling Mao Zedong’s dream of integrating Tibet with central and eastern China. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Nanjiang railway in eastern China. Some say China’s rail growth is comparable to the 19th-century railway boom that helped make the US the world’s leading economy. Photograph: Wang Wei​ The following year, China upped the ante again, kicking off a multibillion dollar high-speed rail revolution designed to demonstrate the Communist party’s scientific – and political – might. Since that pre-Olympic push began, China has built the world’s longest and fastest high-speed rail routes, using sleek white bullet trains to slash the distances between mega-cities including Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou. In just over seven years, about 11,800 miles (19,000km) of high-speed track – about 55% of the global total – has been laid. “What the world did in half-a-century, we have done in 10 years,” said Zhao Jian, a transport expert from Jiaotong University in Beijing. Thailand's ruling junta approves China rail links worth $23bn Read more China’s high-speed lines were initially concentrated along the wealthy eastern coast but increasingly the revolution is sprinting westwards into the deserts and mountains that surround the old Silk Road, at speeds of more than 215 miles per hour (350kph). Beijing’s railways are also going global with countries including the US, Thailand, Indonesia and the UK poised to build high-speed rail projects with differing levels of Chinese involvement. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Wang Wei photographs a train from an overpass close to Beijing South station, which is about 400 metres from his home. Photograph: James Wasserman for the Guardian There were even reports earlier this year that China was considering expanding its rail empire by punching a tunnel under Mount Everest. The furious pace of the expansion has raised red flags, including misgivings over safety in the wake of a deadly 2011 high-speed rail crash near the city of Wenzhou. The disaster, which claimed 40 lives, exposed a web of corruption at the heart of the country’s railways ministry, which was officially disbanded in 2013. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Wang Wei working on a scale model of Xizhimen station, which has been called Beijing North station since 1986. Photograph: James Wasserman for the Guardian Zhao, a long-term critic of China’s high-speed push, said there were also doubts over the financial viability of many projects. Building such connections between major cities such as Beijing or Shanghai made sense but doing so in China’s less densely populated interior was financial madness. “It is like building a 160-floor hotel where only 27 floors make a profit and the rest suffer serious losses,” he said. Wang, who has photographed seven of China’s eight key high-speed “arteries”, describes high-speed rail as a “great invention” that had profoundly changed the lives of millions of Chinese citizens. “In the past, if I wanted to go to Shanghai that would mean spending a whole night on a train unless I took the plane. Now, it’s only a couple hours by train. It has certainly made it easier for me to travel from A to B,” he says. But Wang admits his soft-spot is for China’s old-fashioned fleet of trains, of which some Mao-era models are facing extinction. “It’s quite sad to see the old stations and rail lines being demolished. I’m quite a nostalgic person and I like old things,” he says. “But it’s inevitable as time goes by. The only thing I can do is to document the changes in an artistic way.” Journey into the 1950s: travelling by steam to Chinese town that time forgot Read more Wang’s travels have given him a first-class seat to witness his fast changing homeland. By plane, car and rail he has journeyed to Kashgar, an ancient Silk Road trading hub in China’s far west, Mohe, at the country’s northernmost tip, and to the balmy island of Hainan, which recently opened the world’s only high-speed rail “loop line”. “There are people who believe that travelling abroad is superior to exploring their own country,” says the train buff whose travels have made him a proud patriot determined to use his work to show off China’s natural beauty as well as its trains. Train hunting is not for the lighthearted. During a trip to a remote village in the south-western province of Guizhou, Wang and a friend were forced to cram into a rickety single bed beside a pigsty. While trekking across the Gobi desert earlier this year he accidentally skewered his foot with a large thorn and ended up in an Inner Mongolian emergency room. “I looked down and realised there was a lot of blood on the floor,” he recalls. “It didn’t hurt much at first, but I almost fainted when the nurses in hospital tried to clean the wound.” Facebook Twitter Pinterest The Suijia railway in Heilongjiang province. Photograph: Wang Wei​ Wang’s most treacherous mission was during a trip to the mountain-studded province of Qinghai where he spent a week hiking at night to secure the best shot of his target train. “The oxygen levels there are very low because it is on the [Tibetan] plateau and the altitude is so high,” he says. “I felt a terrible headache when I was climbing.” Ten years after China’s biggest train enthusiast began his wanderings, the railway boom shows no sign of abating. State media announced last month that £288.6bn would be pumped into 14,000 miles of track from now and 2020. For Wang that means the hunt goes on. “I will never stop,” he says. “This is a permanent project.” Additional reporting by Luna Lin and Christy Yao",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Doctor exposed to UK Ebola patient: ‘Lack of clarity serves to fuel anxiety’", "content": "If I thought that the last five weeks in Sierra Leone was about as surreal as life could get, nothing could have prepared me for the journey home and its aftermath. Sadly, one of my colleagues, nurse Pauline Cafferkey, who was travelling back with me on the flight from Freetown, has now been admitted to hospital as a confirmed Ebola case. She seemed fine on the journey home and her temperature would certainly have been normal on leaving Heathrow as no one was allowed to leave the airport until their temperature had been checked twice. I am devastated for my colleague, although confident she will survive this, but especially sad and concerned about the impact that this might have on my colleagues in the wider NHS and their willingness to follow in our footsteps and volunteer. We had complete confidence in our training and equipment and I cannot believe, if proper procedures and protocols were followed, that my friend contracted Ebola while working in the treatment centre. We all went out into the local community – some went for early morning runs, and I went to church on Christmas morning – which in hindsight was probably when we were at greatest risk. Our group of volunteers trained and flew out together but were then allocated to one of several treatment centres across the country, so as a group we didn’t see each other again until we met at Lunghi airport for the return flight. It was a reunion – we all wanted to talk to each other and share stories of this personal and professional experience of a lifetime. I’ve been asked many times who sat next to who. Frankly, everybody sat next to each other at some point, as we were all in high spirits. We had a six-hour wait in Casablanca before boarding the connecting flight to Heathrow. I was surprised that we weren’t segregated from other passengers on arrival at Terminal 4. Instead we filed off the plane and walked to immigration just like everybody else. At this point we were escorted to a crowded room next to the arrivals hall for our health check. This is when I began to feel uncomfortable. There appeared to be inadequate numbers of staff to deal with us and many queued for an hour waiting to be checked. My temperature was raised; the nurse testing it appeared to take a step back and looked nervous. I was isolated for 15 minutes before my temperature was rechecked and was then allowed to go on my way. In contrast to the strict no-touch policy in Sierra Leone, there were a fair few parting hugs and kisses around the baggage carousel. Perhaps the most bizarre element of the whole process was the quarantine advice from Public Health England (PHE). They were content for us to return home from Heathrow by any means – be it a crowded underground train into central London or a connecting flight anywhere in the world. However, once we got there we were told that we should not use public transport (except for short journeys) and not to go to crowded places for three weeks. Thank goodness my colleague took a connecting flight where fellow passengers could be identified and traced – I can’t help wondering what the reaction would have been had she taken the tube to King’s Cross then headed north by train. I am not complaining about the restrictions placed upon us – the public have to be reassured – but it seems to me that inconsistency and a lack of clarity only serve to fuel anxiety and heighten public concern. This is not the way that I would have chosen to end my journey. I didn’t expect a lavish welcome, but they knew we were coming and I thought could have at least been somewhat better prepared. I’m also disappointed that it has taken an infected western healthcare worker to raise public awareness and that the suffering and tenacity of countless thousands of people in west Africa passes unnoticed. We should be involved, we should be engaged, and I hope that events of the last 24 hours do not deflect us from our efforts or inhibit people from wishing to follow in our footsteps.",diasaster:0},

My aim is to get sign language taught in schools, with the same respect and importance as languages such as French and Spanish. I have started a paper and online petition to get sign language into schools and have 3,600 signatures since beginning the campaign six months ago. My goal is to reach 10,000 signatories, so that it has a chance of being discussed in parliament. This is something that concerns me a great deal because my 11-year-old sister Laura is unable to speak: she is deaf and has verbal dyspraxia. Her only means of communication is through sign language. Even going shopping is a major difficulty for her without the ability to talk to a cashier or sales assistant. The simple tasks of life, including going to the doctor and answering the door become impossible with this massive communication barrier. Sign language was made an official language in 2003 but still is not taught in the majority of schools. Our society would benefit greatly if it was. It would enable a large group of people to be included in everyday life. A bond between the deaf and hearing would be created. The mental wellbeing of the deaf would also improve, with fewer people feeling isolated. The hearing would find fulfilment in the knowledge they have gained.    I urge head teachers, governors and all others in the education system to get schools teaching sign language. I hope there is enough support for this idea to change society and end the isolation encountered by people like my sister Laura.

Critics of the ordinance, introduced by a government that won parliamentary elections in December, say it could reverse an anti-corruption fight in Romania that has drawn widespread praise internationally. Additional laws could be issued in the coming days, further eroding ministers’ accountability, according to the government’s opponents. In a post on Facebook, the Romanian president, Klaus Iohannis, who has opposed the emergency ordinance and who last month joined protesters on the streets, wrote: “Today is a day of mourning for the rule of law.” News of the ordinance passing broke at about 10pm local time, and by midnight local media estimated that 12,000 people were demonstrating in Bucharest and 10,000 in other cities across the country, despite freezing temperatures. There were shouts of “Thieves” and “You won’t get away with it.” “I don’t normally protest but I just felt such a sense of rage,” said Alexandra Boeriu, a 35-year-old NGO worker who protested outside the main government building in Bucharest. “I was young, but I did live through communism and I know what this is. I don’t want this for my kids. There are a lot of people protesting who want to have a future in this country. It feels like someone has died.” Facebook Twitter Pinterest Klaus Iohannis: ‘Today is a day of mourning for the rule of law.’ Photograph: Patrick Seeger/EPA “You can’t just publish laws in the night and say shut up, we won the election, you have no rights,” said Dragos Stanca, 42, a digital media entrepreneur who was also demonstrating. “It’s a very dangerous precedent. If this is the kind of procedure they do, we wonder what’s next. It looks like anything is possible.” Protests have been held for the past two Sundays over the government’s plans, which would also grant amnesty to those sentenced to jail terms shorter than five years in relation to certain crimes and halve prison terms for those with young children, pregnant women, or those over 60. The EU has weighed in on the controversy, warning the government not to backtrack on anti-graft measures. “The fight against corruption needs to be advanced, not undone,” European commission head Jean-Claude Juncker and his deputy, Frans Timmermans, said in a joint statement. “We are following the latest developments in Romania with great concern.” Government officials have suggested the laws were aimed at easing overcrowded conditions in prisons, but few observers are convinced, and many believe the real purpose is to help convicted politicians, or those who are now under investigation, escape justice. Romania, an enthusiastic EU member for a decade and a major recipient of EU funds, remains one of Europe’s most corrupt countries: a report by the IPP thinktank released late last year found that of the 588 MPs elected in previous elections in 2012, 89 – or 15% – were either under investigation for graft, had already been convicted, or chose to step down for other positions. Hundreds of officials have been imprisoned in recent years, and more than 2,000 files are under investigation in relation to abuse of office, according to prosecutors. “With this government I feel insecure and the new law which favours corruption is a huge offence and an attack on us, the regular people,” said Alberto Grosescu, a 29-year-old photographer who took to the streets on Tuesday night immediately after the ordinance was announced. Grosescu predicts that many more people will come out to protest. “I’m pretty sure that tonight there is going to be over 100,000 people in Bucharest, maybe over 200,000 across the whole country,” he said. Those protesting hope that their actions could still lead to change. “They have to, I don’t think politicians can ignore so many people, but we have to stand up and continue to stand up,” said Boeriu.

{ "title":"Who is Neil Gorsuch? A staunch conservative with a background to worry liberals", "content": "In a 2005 essay titled Liberals ’N’ Lawsuits, Neil Gorsuch, then a corporate lawyer in Washington, DC, argued that “American liberals” had come to rely too much on court decisions to advance “their social agenda on everything from gay marriage to assisted suicide to the use of vouchers for private-school education”. Published just months after the re-election of George W Bush, it was a remarkable bit of concern-trolling ahead of its time. If liberals really wanted to enact their agenda, Gorsuch wrote, they should focus on “trying to win elections rather than lawsuits”. Neil Gorsuch nominated by Trump to fill supreme court vacancy Read more Fast-forward 12 years. American liberals – and quite a few centrists too – have lost another election and many have once again turned their eyes to the courts, hoping for protection from what looks to many of them like a vicious attack by the executive branch on core rights and freedoms. If Donald Trump has his way Gorsuch will be in a position this time to do more than just write an essay. If confirmed by the Senate as the newest justice on the US supreme court, he will have unique power to help vindicate or frustrate liberals’ strategy. The announcement of Gorsuch’s nomination in a hyped White House spectacle on Tuesday night was greeted with expressions of concern on the left and robust cheer on the right. Carrie Severino, chief counsel of the conservative Judicial Crisis Network, hailed Gorsuch as a “principled constitutionalist” with “an obviously brilliant legal mind”. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Trump picks Neil Gorsuch for US supreme court “He is someone who is going to look at any question according to what the constitution itself says, setting aside his own political views” whatever they may be, Severino said. A partisan scrum has developed around the nomination nevertheless, with Democrats vowing a filibuster and the Republican senate leadership vowing a confirmation. The air of partisan controversy is not obviously rooted in Gorsuch’s track record as a circuit court judge, which does not include rulings on the kinds of hot-button social issues he alluded to in his Bush-era essay. Gorsuch’s disposition on abortion rights cases may be suggested in a line from a book he wrote about euthanasia, the subject of his doctoral studies at Oxford University. “To act intentionally against life is to suggest that its value rests only on its transient instrumental usefulness for other ends,” Gorsuch wrote. Nancy Northup, president and CEO of the Center for Reproductive Rights, said the onus was on the nominee to explain his position on the issue. “Given president Trump’s promise to appoint a supreme court justice that would seek to overturn Roe v Wade, we need to know whether Judge Gorsuch would do just that,” Northup said. The looming issues awaiting Donald Trump's supreme court nominee Read more “Our constitution guarantees a woman’s right to safe, legal abortion. Any effort to gut those protections would harm the rights and health of women for generations to come.” But beyond any single issue Gorsuch has articulated a judicial philosophy that emphasizes the primacy of the constitution and prizes the text of laws, while warning against judicial forays that might be mistaken for an attempt to shape or direct legislation. “Congress could have written the law differently than it did, and it is always free to rewrite the law when it wishes,” Gorsuch wrote in a ruling that argued for a new hearing for a felon convicted of firearm possession. “But in our legal order it is the role of the courts to apply the law as it is written, not some different law Congress might have written in the past or might write in the future.” In some ways Gorsuch seems likely to please social conservatives. He has repeatedly upheld claims of a religious exemption where the law would compel an individual to violate a personal spiritual belief. While the supreme court declined to consider one such “religious liberty” case in 2016, in which a family-owned pharmacy objected to a state regulation forcing it to sell emergency contraceptives, future cases in the area seem likely. In Hobby Lobby Stores Inc v Sebelius, Gorsuch argued that a retail store owner need not comply with a provision in Barack Obama’s health care law requiring employers to provide health insurance covering oral contraceptives. In his opinion Gorsuch gave wide berth to the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which asserts the religious liberty claim and which Gorsuch called a “super-statute”. Hannah Smith, a lawyer at the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, which represented Hobby Lobby in the case, praised the judge’s ruling. “That opinion is an example that he is a clear thinker, a clear writer on really complicated religious liberty issues,” Smith told the Guardian. “They were faced with a Hobson’s choice, to choose to abide by their religion or saving their business. I think he’s someone who would stand up for the religious liberty for all.” Elsewhere Gorsuch has ruled sympathetically in cases involving the erection of Ten Commandments monuments in public spaces and ruled against capital punishment defendants seeking relief from their sentences. In the integrity of his adherence to the principal of judicial restraint, as well as in the pithy eloquence – if he lacks a certain acerbity – of his opinions, Gorsuch is often compared favorably with the justice he would replace, Antonin Scalia, who died in February 2016. “His writing style has often been compared to Justice Scalia’s,” Severino said. “It’s very incisive, very clear and logical, but also very entertaining, and of course that was a hallmark of Justice Scalia’s own writing style.” Gorsuch spoke about Scalia’s death in an April 2016 speech at Case Western University. “I was taking a breather in the middle of a ski run with little on my mind but the next mogul field when my phone rang with the news,” Gorsuch said. “I immediately lost what breath I had left, and I am not embarrassed to admit that I couldn’t see the rest of the way down the mountain for the tears. He really was a lion of the law: docile in private life but a ferocious fighter when at work, with a roar that could echo for miles.” Gorsuch’s biggest difference with Scalia comes in the field of administrative law, an area that is sleepy for most laypeople but determines the scope of much government action. The Trump nominee has been a critic of “Chevron deference,” a doctrine that gives administrative agencies significant latitude with how they interpret federal statutes. His views, which are shared by a number of conservative legal scholars, would significantly weaken the federal government and allow the courts to override agency actions on issues ranging from immigration to health care to the environment. But several former colleagues of Gorsuch’s from across the ideological spectrum have called for Gorsuch’s confirmation, saying his temperament is distinctly different from Scalia. “Scalia’s writing seemed dismissive to the claims of gay rights,” said Melissa Hart, professor at the University of Colorado Law School who worked with Gorsuch. “Everything I know about Neil Gorsuch as a person leads me to believe he would not be dismissive of anyone’s claims, regardless of how he rules. I’m not saying I think he will rule in favor of LGBT rights but I don’t think he will be dismissive of anyone’s claims.” Hart said she believes Gorsuch is “more than qualified to be on the supreme court”, echoing an op-ed in the New York Times by Neal Katyal, a former acting solicitor general under Barack Obama, that called for liberals to back Gorsuch. “I understand the political reasons for wanting to block the nomination,” Hart said, “but I don’t think there’s a principled reason to reject Neil Gorsuch as a jurist.” Neil McGill Gorsuch was born on 29 August 1967 and grew up in Denver, Colorado. His family moved to Washington, DC, after Ronald Reagan nominated his mother, Anne Gorsuch Burford, to head the Environmental Protection Agency. Gorsuch attended Georgetown preparatory school, Columbia University, Harvard Law school and Oxford University, where he enrolled on a Marshall scholarship and earned a doctorate. He fits the mold of every sitting justice on the US supreme court in educational pedigree: they all went to Harvard or Yale for law school. Post-graduation, Gorsuch worked for a decade representing mostly corporate clients at the Washington law firm of Kellogg Huber Hansen Todd Evans & Figel. But Mark Hansen, the nominee’s former boss at the firm, told the Denver Post that Gorsuch was a “regular person”. “He acts and relates well to all people, and he did the same sort of thing in trial, where he was very good at making connections with jurors,” Hansen said. “He’s a regular person. It’s part of being a Westerner.” At Oxford, Gorsuch met his future wife, Louise Gorsuch, a UK citizen. With their two teenage daughters they lives outside Boulder, Colorado, where Gorsuch indulges hobbies including fly-fishing, hiking and rowing. After his 2005 essay subtly celebrating the re-election of George W Bush, Gorsuch got good news from the administration. Gorsuch was to be appointed to the 10th circuit appeals court, which covers all or part of Colorado, Kansas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Utah and Wyoming. In 2006, when it came time for the Senate to review his nomination, Gorsuch was confirmed in the most expeditious way possible, by a voice vote and encountering no objection. This time may be different. With reporting by Ben Jacobs",diasaster:0},

The difficulty of this vote for the party was etched on the face of the shadow Brexit secretary, Sir Keir Starmer, as he wove his way through the mess of conflicting ambitions that constitute current party policy. We would rather that the party had voted with its heart than, as it perhaps did, with an eye on its electoral prospects in leave areas like Stoke and Copeland. We would say the same about the Conservative remainers too. But Labour’s equivocations on Europe long predated the vote and will continue long after. Yet unless it can find a stronger position to unite around on such a central issue, Labour will struggle to be a credible party of opposition. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Brexit debate: the best Commons speeches, from Ken Clarke to Nick Clegg But Labour’s dismal performance is not the real scandal of Wednesday’s vote, and those who pretend it is are playing the leavers’ game. The real scandal is that, with the distinguished exception of Ken Clarke, the Tory party’s many remainers bent the knee. As a result, the government had an overwhelming majority on the second reading of the bill to trigger article 50. Its failure to publish a white paper before the debate went unpunished. This disregard for the most basic of requirements for a decision of such consequence must not be allowed to be a taste of things to come. It is all the more alarming that, as late as Tuesday, it seems no draft had been circulated: the home secretary, a member of the small group of senior ministers who sit on the cabinet committee on Brexit, told MPs she had not seen it. Yet, even as the potentially grim consequences of Brexit become clearer, Theresa May’s timetable for the process of departure remains on track. It is not all over, however. Everything is still possible. Now the prime minister must come clean about the choices that lie ahead, and their consequences – and she must convey to the whole of Britain the scale of the task ahead. Even without a white paper, it is clear that she puts controlling borders and repatriating law at the head of her list of priorities. It is also clear, as George Osborne told the Commons, that at the head of the EU’s list is the integrity of the union of the remaining 27 members. Those governing ideas will, unavoidably, make many of the other ambitions that Mrs May set out in her speech a fortnight ago extremely challenging. The negotiations will be just that – negotiations that must be conducted with the intention of reaching an agreement that is acceptable for both sides. It is an irony that Mrs May will not appreciate that the European court of justice from which she so ardently wishes to escape is highly likely to be called in to adjudicate on aspects of the final deal, as its president Koen Lenaerts points out. Mrs May talks ominously about no deal being better than a bad deal, and claims to be prepared to crash out on World Trade Organisation terms. This is a terrible strategy. As the SNP’s Westminster leader, Angus Robertson, put it at prime minister’s questions, Mrs May has made one successful foreign trip in the past week. That was her trip to Dublin, where she and the Irish taoiseach, Enda Kenny, discussed how best to preserve the free trade area and protect the Northern Ireland peace process. She would do well to take the lesson about the value of negotiations conducted in good faith and a spirit of cooperation. A hard Brexit would be ruinous. Every MP should spend the coming week consulting their local businesses on the impact of WTO terms, and calculate their likely impact on jobs and prices. The referendum itself has been a catastrophe. But if Mrs May continues to treat leaving the EU as if it can be achieved in a couple of years of hard work, she is doing the voters a grave disservice. She knows the cost of making pledges on immigration that are unachievable. Suggesting that Brexit can be done and dusted before the next election is a deceit on a monstrous scale. As Sir Ivan Rogers, the former UK ambassador to the EU, told MPs on the Brexit committee on Wednesday morning, the task ahead was “humongous”. It would, unavoidably, be bloody. This will be a long game, and the government must say so.",diasaster:0},

{ "title":"Boxing Day sales hope to lure UK shoppers with biggest discounts yet", "content": "Millions of shoppers will hit the high street on Boxing Day as retailers offer the biggest discounts since the 2008 financial crash after a difficult festive season. Retail experts expect shops to offer discounts topping last year’s average of more than 50%, according to advisory firm Deloitte, as they try to clear clothing that has been left on the shelves as much of Britain enjoyed balmy early winter temperatures. “Anyone selling coats, jumpers and boots has had a difficult time. There is going to be heavy discounting of those goods after Christmas,” said Andy Lyon, a retail expert at advisory firm PwC. Despite all the hype around last month’s Black Friday sales, analysts expect about 14 million shoppers to spend between £2.74bn and £2.9bn on Boxing Day, more than double the amount spent on the US-inspired discount day. White Christmas off and UK ice rinks melt in mild December weather Read more “Many retailers didn’t find Black Friday was particularly good and so there is a lot of stuff to get rid of on the high street – we are expecting Boxing Day to be good,” said Joshua Bamfield of the Centre for Retail Research, who is predicting sales will rise 5% on last year to £2.9bn. “Boxing Day is the UK’s true Black Friday because, like Black Friday in the US, it is a day when most people are off work and are looking for something to do,” said Neil Saunders at retail consultancy Conlumino. He predicted shoppers would spend £2.74bn, up less than 1% on last year, as bargain-hunters join those spending their Christmas vouchers or cash and people returning unwanted gifts. With most people on holiday, Boxing Day will be much more beneficial for physical stores than Black Friday, when high streets remained quiet but online companies struggled to cope with demand. FootFall, which tracks shopping behaviour, has predicted 3% more shoppers will visit high streets, shopping centres and retail parks on Boxing Day compared with last year. That’s a major turnaround from weeks of difficult times on the high street when the number of visitors has been down year-on-year. A combination of unseasonably warm weather across most of the country, storms and floods in certain areas, and security fears in the wake of the terrorist attacks in Paris have put a dampener on store visits and fed the trend towards shopping online from the sofa. Shoppers also left their gift-buying late as many families squeezed their shopping into the final four working days before Christmas Day. Shopping centres are preparing for early morning queues on Boxing Day as retailers such as Next, Harrods, Jigsaw and the department stores Selfridges and Fenwick, who do not offer discounts before 26 December, finally get out the red stickers. “Early sales will not deter the determined Boxing Day sales shopper, as the focus will move from gift buying to shoppers treating themselves,” said Myf Ryan, director of marketing for the UK shopping centres owned by Westfield. Intu, which owns the Trafford Centre in Manchester, Lakeside in Thurrock, Essex, and Merry Hill near Birmingham, said it expected a million shoppers to visit its centres on Boxing Day. “There will be queues at a number of our sites and it will be an early start for some retailers,” said Gordon McKinnon, operations director of Intu. Steven Madeley, general manager for St David’s shopping centre in Cardiff, said he was expecting shoppers to spend about £2m at the centre on Boxing Day. “Hi-tech gadgets and beauty have performed particularly well, and we expect savvy shoppers to get some great deals over the coming days. Some of our stores even closed early on Christmas Eve this year to prepare for a busy Boxing Day,” he said. Amazon and eBay face crackdown over VAT fraud by overseas sellers Read more Some stores are putting on special events to try to draw shoppers away from the TV. Harrods has organised a performance by the cast of the West End show Elf the Musical on a stage outside the store, while butlers will be serving hot chocolate to those in the queue. The retailer said it expected to welcome more than a million customers over the four weeks of its sale period. But online retailers will still be the big winners on Boxing Day. They are bracing for another surge in sales as they take a bigger share of spending this year. An estimated £856m will be spent at internet stores on Boxing Day, 22% up on last year, according to analysts at Experian and IMRG, the online retailers association. The traditional start of the post-Christmas sales is now the third-biggest online day of the year behind Black Friday and the following Monday, known as Cyber Monday – when £1.1bn and £968m of goods were ordered, respectively. While the vast majority of high street stores will be closed on Christmas Day, online tills will have been ringing right the way through the festivities. Many retailers now start their sales online on Christmas Eve, making Christmas Day a busy online shopping day itself. An estimated £728m, 11% more than last year, is expected to be spent online as shoppers log on – perhaps using their newly unwrapped tablet computers, laptops and phones – on 25 December. Nick Jones from Experian said: “The rise of the use of personal connected devices means consumers can now shop for bargains on their mobile or tablet when they have a spare couple of minutes – even if that does mean sneaking away from the festivities and risking the wrath of family members.”",diasaster:0},

There was snow, a Christmas dinner of sorts and, yes, a headless robot charging around the galaxy in search of its head, played by a funny, pompous Greg Davies, but also depth, warmth and comedy, with Alex Kingston reprising her ongoing role as the Doctor’s time-travelling wife, River Song. Considering they had never met – at least in this regenerated incarnation – there was real chemistry between Peter Capaldi and Kingston. Watching the Doctor pretending to be in awe of the Tardis’s unique proportions (it’s bigger on the inside!) was a treat, a joke broad enough to work for both Who-obsessives and families who only visit the Doctor once a year. They discussed mortality, love, belonging, and what it means to be nostalgic for the past while worrying about the future: a jumble of Christmas emotions wrapped under alien skies.

Now that’s nature at its most devious.” He boggled at a possible solution to the enigma of zebra stripes (“a miraculous and disorientating illusion”). The sneakiest animal?

{ "title":"C of E to fast-track minority ethnic clergy into senior roles", "content": "The Church of England is to fast-track black and ethnic minority clergy into senior positions amid accusations of institutional racism. A “talent pool” of specifically black, Asian and minority ethnic (Bame) potential leaders will be identified in 2016 for training and mentoring with the aim of increasing representation among bishops, deans and archdeacons. The church selected its first talent pool this year, but fewer than 7% of those chosen were from ethnic minorities. A second round is currently being selected. The church is to devote a third group specifically to Bame clergy. However, only 2.8% of C of E clergy are from ethnic minorities, which limits the numbers available for fast-tracking. At senior levels, the sole Bame bishop is John Sentamu, the archbishop of York; there is one Bame dean; and three archdeacons. Only 3% of the members of the last synod – the church parliament – were from ethnic minorities; figures are not yet available for the new synod elected in October. “[Sentamu’s] rise to the top has almost lulled people into a false sense of security; it’s enabled us to take our eye off the ball,” said Stephen Cottrell, the bishop of Chelmsford, who has pushed for greater Bame representation in the church’s leadership. “It’s embarrassing that we are going backwards on this issue rather than forwards.” Although the church established its Committee for Minority Ethnic Anglican Concerns more than 30 years ago, it has recently stepped up efforts to improve Bame representation. An initiative called Turning Up the Volume was set up in 2012 with the aim of doubling the number of Bame clergy in senior positions within 10 years. But the target was “unchallenging”, given the starting point, said James Langstaff, bishop of Rochester, who chairs the group. There was an urgent need to change attitudes and bias, he added. “[Some within the church] hesitate to use the language of institutional racism. We also speak of conscious or unconscious bias, which is slightly less emotive. But it is, in my view, undeniable that there is racism within the system, because gifted people have not found their way into senior leadership,” said Langstaff. The issue was raised at the first meeting of the new synod in November – a gathering that was striking for its overwhelming whiteness. Apart from Sentamu and a handful of minority ethnic members, most non-white faces belonged to security guards and catering staff. Julie Conalty, the vicar of Christ Church in Erith, Kent, whose congregation is 50% black, asked a question from the synod floor about positive action measures to advance women and Bame clergy through the ranks. “I see a lot of goodwill, but not a systematic top-to-bottom drive to deal with what is institutional racism,” she said later. Facebook Twitter Pinterest John Sentamu, the archbishop of York. Photograph: Carl Court/Getty Images “What’s really scandalous is that, unlike the debate about women priests and bishops, there is no possible theological reasons why Bame clergy cannot hold leadership positions, so there shouldn’t be any negotiations or debate,” she added. “We should be streets ahead.” Tim Thornton, bishop of Truro, who chairs the development and appointments group, acknowledged that progress had been slow. “We haven’t got any better at it, and we’ve been talking about it for 30 years,” he said. The church was failing in many ways to reflect society, he added. “This is part of a bigger picture that is something to do with the fact that we’ve become very introspective, and we’re in danger of carrying on a steady road to decline. Somehow we have to look very closely at what we’re doing right back at the beginning – why is it we are not attracting people? That’s a much deeper problem about, metaphorically speaking, how wide our doors are.” Many point to a lack of welcome by the C of E to immigrants since the 1950s. Anderson Jeremiah, an ordained Anglican priest at Lancaster University’s department of politics, philosophy and religion, said immigrants from south Asia, the Caribbean and Africa had faced “inhospitality” from the C of E, which had “gently and politely diverted them to churches where they might ‘feel more comfortable’.” Facebook Twitter Pinterest The general synod gathering in London last month. Photograph: Carl Court/Getty Images Partly as a result, black-majority pentecostal churches “are growing by leaps and bounds. People see others like them at the front of the church in leadership positions, and it gives them a sense of belonging”. He added: “Until there is a systematic mechanism to ensure there is a visible change at a structural, hierarchical level [in the C of E], it’s hard to see how this can change any time soon.” Rose Hudson-Wilkin, chaplain to the speaker of the House of Commons, described coming to England from the Caribbean in 1979 as a teenager to find almost no black people leading C of E services. “I’d be dishonest if I didn’t say racism plays a big part of where the church is today in terms of lack of representation in leadership,” she said. “The church has to wake up. In the same way it has agonised over women, and has eventually seen that it’s right for women to be in leadership within the church, it needs to put the same amount of work when it comes to minority ethnic people. Now, every time the church sits down to make an appointment it asks ‘where are the women?’ I don’t think it’s saying ‘where are the minority ethnic people?’ It has got to right this wrong.” Jason Roach, a minister at Christ Church Mayfair, said the “woeful under-representation” of minority ethnic people in the church meant a lack of role models. “I’ve spoken to young black people, trying to encourage them to join the church, into vocations, and often what they’ve said is ‘we don’t feel this is a place for us’.” Although he personally had been encouraged and nurtured, “you are nevertheless always aware that you’re very much in a minority, and at times that can be intimidating,” said Roach. The church has begun offering those responsible for making appointments training in “unconscious bias”, starting with senior officials in the diocese of Chelmsford. “It has helped to unmask some of the ways we make decisions,” said Cottrell, acknowledging that the C of E was “way behind other organisations” in introducing such training. Bame members of the church face barriers of “networks and connections” as well as straightforward racism and discrimination, said Elizabeth Henry, national adviser to the Committee for Minority Ethnic Anglican Concerns. The Bame talent pool was a welcome step, she said, but added: “This is not going to be a panacea. It’s one element of addressing these issues within the church.” Pentecostal experience At the United Pentecostal Faith church in Lambeth, there is no need to fast-track black and ethnic minority ethnic congregants into senior positions. The church is led by Bishop Ervin Smith, who came to the UK from Jamaica 60 years ago, and he is supported by four black pastors. Most of his congregation are black, too, though “sometimes three or four white people come along”, he says. After arriving in London, Smith sought out his nearest church, a C of E establishment in Streatham. “I was welcomed there, but it was a bit different to the Pentecostal worship I was used to. I found a place in Brixton where my people were.” Pentecostal services are louder and longer, he says, with music, singing, dancing and preaching. “We can go on for two or three hours,” he says. Smith does not prepare his sermons. “You are led by the spirit, you preach the gospel, the word of God.” In the past, he says, there was more interaction between denominations. “We used to meet up, the Catholics, Church of England, Methodists, Baptists and us. Sometimes we’d swap – I was the first black man ever to preach at the Catholic church in Brixton, in 1964.” That has fallen away now, he says regretfully. “Names are just labels. All churches should be the same. We should be as one.”",diasaster:0},

He would soon play an even more central role in the story, identifying US citizen Walter James Palmer as Cecil’s assailant, and releasing his passport number and address. “They went hunting at night with a spotlight and they spotted Cecil,” he says. “They tied a dead animal to their vehicle to lure Cecil out of the park and they scented an area about half a kilometre from the park. Mr Palmer shot Cecil with a bow and arrow but this shot didn’t kill him. They tracked him down and found him 40 hours later when they shot him with a gun.” Facebook Twitter Pinterest Elephants stroll through Hwange national park. Photograph: Xinhua Press/Corbis Palmer became the subject of an online witch-hunt which forced him to go into hiding after numerous death threats. Eventually Zimbabwe said he would not face charges over the killing, because he had obtained the correct permits. Theo Bronkhorst, the professional hunter who facilitated the killing, is facing legal action in Zimbabwe for violating the terms of his hunting permit. For Rodrigues, the six months since Cecil the lion’s death have given him an unprecedented platform to advocate for the cause that he has made his life’s work. “Cecil didn’t die for no reason. Cecil died for a cause. Things in conservation are going to change in the next few years, and it’s going to make this planet better,” he told the Guardian. Johnny Rodrigues: ‘There are a lot of animals that can’t speak out, but we can.’ Photograph: Zimbabwe Conservation Task Force “I was shocked at the response from the world. I’ve lived in a bad dream for 35 years, but people who have had something in the back of their conscience about animals, they have now woken up. Even if it has died off in mainstream media, on social media the conversation has actually strengthened. We’ve become a force to be reckoned with. There are a lot of animals that can’t speak out, but we can,” he says. Rodrigues has been invited to give talks at Cecil the lion remembrance marches in New York and Washington DC in July next year. Although he didn’t go into the numbers, he says the ZCTF, which relies on donor funding, has been flooded with new donations. Rodrigues’s elevated profile offers some vindication for the wildlife activist, who has not always had it easy. He has had several run-ins with Robert Mugabe’s Zimbabwean government, which has not always appreciated his outspoken criticism of its conservation policy. In 2003, he was told by a director of the National Parks Authority that he was “persona non grata” and would no longer be allowed entry to any national parks. “I’m not the government’s favourite person, but I’m still here,” Rodrigues says. He remains critical of the government. He says: “The cake is big enough. Why is it that the majority of people get the crumbs, and the few get big slices of cake?” The Guardian view on Cecil the lion: the immorality is in the pleasure of the kill | Editorial Read more Rodrigues argues that the government should do more to improve the economic situation of people near conservation areas, thus removing the financial incentive to hunt. “We could be relying on solar energy, giving it to the people who farm near these wildlife areas. We could be giving a percentage from the tourism industry to these people. We could do so much, but we don’t, because the dictatorship does not benefit. They want to use humans like puppets.” It is people, ultimately, that Rodrigues believes pose the greatest threat to African wildlife. Rodrigues says: “Nobody is talking about human overpopulation. What concerns me is what are future generations going to be doing if we don’t have population control? This planet is not going to feed the masses, and now the people are going into the wildlife areas.”",diasaster:0},

Some crises are familiar or have gone on for years, such as the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the Iran nuclear conundrum or Syria’s devastating civil war. Others are of a more surprising nature, or at least would have been difficult to predict at the outset of 2014. Who would have guessed, a year ago, that Russia would annex Crimea? Or that global oil prices would fall by 40%? Or that North Korea would cyber-attack Sony? Some changes were nevertheless foreseen. The western withdrawal from Afghanistan had been clearly signalled. But who would have anticipated that 2014 would see the US launch a new war in Iraq as it tries to quell a new jihadi insurgency? Trying to guess what new disruptions might be in store for 2015 on the global stage is certainly a risky game. Harold Macmillan’s words come to mind: it is “events, dear boy, events” that drive international relations, much more so than carefully thought-out plans. But here are a few guesses. Europe will remain a headache. New anxieties will appear over the fate of the eurozone as countries like Greece and Spain enter electoral cycles that might bring anti-establishment parties to power. European nations are losing patience with austerity. The former German foreign minister, Joschka Fischer, has called 2015 a “make or break year” for the European Union. But Europe won’t only be faced with internal political or financial woes. Its security continues to be at stake, with outside forces bringing more potential destabilisation. In the east, there is no knowing how far Vladimir Putin will want to push his revisionist challenge to the post-1989 European order. Moldova, as well as southern regions of Ukraine, may well become new targets. As Russia heads for a deep economic recession, there is cause to expect unrest and more external adventures. To the south, further challenges for Europe can be anticipated on the Arab rim of the Mediterranean. Libya will be the place to watch. Four years after the overthrow of Colonel Gaddafi, it is in the middle of a raging civil war. Libya is fractured, with two competing groups claiming to be the legitimate rulers: one has taken control of Tripoli, the capital; the other is based in the eastern city of Tobruk. Libya matters to Europe not least because it is a major transit country for migrants attempting to cross the Mediterranean at the risk of their lives. It also matters because of the jihadi threat as this failing state falls into further chaos. Worried about the fallout, including for the whole region of the Sahel, some African leaders are, along with France, calling for a new international intervention in Libya. There is another African train-wreck waiting to happen. Nigeria is gearing up for tense presidential elections. It is confronted with the growing armed insurgency of Boko Haram as well as the falling price of oil (oil represents 70% of the state’s revenues). In 2015, Africa will certainly offer a picture of contrasts: on the one hand, deeply ingrained problems (failed governance, Islamist networks, conflicts); on the other, positive transformations (the mobile phone revolution, economic growth). Amid these familiar issues, the march of international cyber-confrontation will continue to open up new challenges. There will be more spectacular hacking and cyberwarfare, as the internet becomes the arena in which state and non-state entities carry out their shows of force. In a way, the world now resembles a “Gafa” planet, the acronym for Google-Apple-Facebook-Amazon, which together account for revenues well over €300bn and half of the connected world population. These are the superpowers of the new global economy, while manufacturing growth seems to be slowing down. Falling oil prices will not only affect geopolitics but also affect the fight against global warming. If hydrocarbons come cheaper, it will be even harder to reach a new international treaty on climate change at the Paris conference next December. Amid all the suspense, there is one certainty: in an age of great volatility and globalisation, crises will be interconnected, making it harder than ever to stand entirely aside.",diasaster:0},

Single-handedly, she turned the dull-sounding public accounts committee into the most rigorous scrutineer, excoriating wrongdoers and backsliders. Watch bankers, tax-avoiding CEOs, failing ministers and permanent secretaries quail under her sharp tongue. Razor-sharp analysis and forensic questioning are her weapons, while jargon-free indignation sears her criticisms on the public mind. “I think you do evil!” will never be forgotten by the wretched executive from tax-avoiding Google. She made mincemeat of Amazon for earning £4.2bn but paying just £3.2m UK tax. Tax avoidance was nowhere on the political spectrum until she sharpened her scalpel on HMRC and its sweetheart deals. She lambasted the big four accountancy firms for playing on both sides – advising government on tax schemes, then telling clients how to avoid them. Without her, George Osborne would never have taken up the scandal that deprives the Treasury of billions. Iain Duncan Smith and the Department for Work and Pensions have been lashed over his disastrous universal credit, work programme and personal independence payment fiascos: how many more times will she catch them warping the figures? Monumental failure of border controls is another Hodge perennial, the asylum seekers backlog longer than when Charles Clarke was forced to resign.

{ "title":"London New Year’s Eve fireworks made ticket-only for first time", "content": "Exactly a year ago, an estimated 500,000 people crammed into a small section of central London to view the New Year’s Eve firework display, resulting in crowded conditions that the mayor, Boris Johnson, said had made the free event “untenable”. As a result, for the first time on Thursday evening only 100,000 paying ticket holders will be permitted to watch London’s annual celebration from a fenced-off area, with the Metropolitan police urging those without reservations to find their new year fun elsewhere – or better still, stay at home, noting “the display is being shown live and in full on television”. If the restriction of this year’s event will disappoint some, others are likely to be breathing a sigh of relief, according to research that suggests almost two thirds of Britons are planning to avoid transport chaos, taxi queues and pricey babysitting charges by seeing in the new year at home. A survey of 2,000 people by Post Office home insurance found that one in four plan to spend a quiet night in with their partner, with 23% staying in with family and friends, and a further 6% hosting a party or dinner at home. Research from Cancer Research UK, released on Wednesday, found that only 11% of respondents ideally wanted to spend New Year’s Eve going out. One in seven did not want to celebrate the new year at all. In Edinburgh, there were still tickets available on Tuesday for the city’s 75,000-capacity Hogmanay street party, as well as for a concert by Lily Allen in the West Princes Street gardens, although other events, including a candlelit concert at St Giles’ cathedral and a ceilidh at the Mound precinct, were sold out. Supermarkets have reported strong sales for champagne and spirits, which may suggest an increasing number of people plan to celebrate away from pubs and clubs. A spokeswoman for Waitrose said sales of champagne and sparkling wine for the fortnight before Christmas were up by 14% and 20% respectively on last year, a trend she expected to continue into the pre-new year period. Scottish malt whisky sales rose by 26% and gin by 29% with particular growth in premium bottled English beers, which saw a year-on-year sales increase of 46%. But Brigid Simmonds, chief executive of the British Beer and Pub Association, said that while alcohol consumption overall was down 19% since 2004, figures from the Christmas period suggested that pubs had served more meals than ever before, and that she expected a similar trend over new year, with people heading out for meals and staying out to celebrate. “I think an awful lot of people will spend New Year’s Eve in pubs, because they are a place where you go to celebrate with groups of people as well as with friends and family.” Weather forecasters predict a much milder evening than many parts of Britain have experienced over the past few days. But a spokesman for the Met Office said the country would be divided by a band of rain stretching from Aberdeen to south-west England, with generally dry conditions on either side, and temperatures of up to 10-11C in the west.",diasaster:0},

International sport is now awash with money and where there is money and very little accountability, there will be problems. Doubts about Fifa have been there for some time, with very little changing at the top with the same old faces making decisions and patting each other on the back. Fifa’s credibility is all but gone as the scandals persist. International sport has become big business and totally corporatised, with high-back leather chairs accompanying it, not to mention the massive endowments given to those at the top. Fifa is no stranger to corruption, with allegations of competition-fixing for host countries and bribery on sponsorship deals for its World Cup still causing doubts about its legitimacy.

The former manager responsible has been accused of “handing out contracts that the players cannot survive on”. Tom Jolliffe Brixham, Devon • The top three BBC TV sports personalities of 2015, as voted for by the public, were a tennis player, a rugby league player and an athlete. The BBC shortlist of 12 did not include a single male footballer. Your front-page headline on 22 December was “Fifa hands Blatter and Platini red cards”, and this article about two disgraced football officials was continued on two inside pages. The Journal in your main section had three pages devoted to the profile of an ex-football manager (The devil and José Mourinho).

{ "title":"ADHD: a ‘real’ brain disorder or further medicalising of childhood?", "content": "Educational psychologists’ alarm about the over-prescribing of hyperactivity drugs to very young children (Report, 22 December) is welcome. But the underlying question remains: how it is that a “disorder” which scarcely existed in the UK in the 1980s, though widespread in the US, is apparently so prevalent that it is said to affect up to 5% of our nation’s children? Even the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines, to which your report refers, do not question that attention deficit hyperactivity disorder is a “real” brain disorder, rather than a convenient way of labelling a child who is boisterous and disruptive in class. Ask paediatricians how often they saw children with “minimal brain dysfunction”, as ADHD was then known, in the 80s, and their answers range from one in 100 to one in 500. In the early 90s, Ritalin prescriptions were running at about 2,000 a year, although the drug had been available for years and was in massive use in the US. Today, the figure is over 600,000. Does the fault really lie inside our children’s brains, or is it a further – and dangerous – manifestation of a medicalising culture? Steven Rose Emeritus professor of biology (neuroscience), The Open University • I was not surprised to read that “overstretched health workers go straight to medication rather than offering psychological interventions” to children with ADHD. Being a community paediatrician, I see the lion’s share of children who have neurodevelopmental disorders – at my clinic we see around three children under the age of six every week that are suspected to have ADHD. Psychological interventions should always be prioritised (as per Nice guidance); however, as the burden of ADHD is grossly under-recognised and therefore underfunded, many community paediatric departments do not have a clinical psychologist in place. This makes providing psychological treatment much easier said than done. If this postcode lottery does not end and these fragile young children fail to receive the appropriate help they so desperately need, they are, albeit unwittingly, being set on a slippery path – latest research suggests that children with undiagnosed or untreated mental health conditions are much more likely to struggle to achieve educational qualifications and are at much greater risk of committing crime, suffering alcoholism and abusing drugs later in life. Investment in these vital support services is needed now to help guide these children to a safer future. Dr Neel Kamal Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health • Children under six are meant to be hyperactive! In the sense that they should be running around pretty much 12 hours a day. What they lack is opportunities for exercise, particularly outdoors. I see children being taken to and from infant school in buggies, when any normal child over 18 months should not be in a buggy at all. Too many young children are already obese; cooped up at home, in a car, or plonked in front of a TV, then won’t sleep at night. Mary Smith Upminster, Essex • There is a danger of confusing the moral panic in relation to medication for ADHD with the reality of the nature of this condition. The result is to dismiss it as some sort of pseudo-scientific construct sponsored by pharmacological corporations. My own research and working practice shows, if anything, that ADHD is underdiagnosed and under-treated in at least some localities in the UK. Perhaps it would be helpful to dispense with the hyperbole and focus more on the statistical evidence regarding incidence and intervention rates. Health and local authorities need precise information about the extent of the problem, and professionals and clinicians need actively to identify affected children and young people in order to provide adequate services. While “pills are not a substitute for skills”, the evidence clearly shows the efficacy of medication as part of a comprehensive treatment plan. In approaching the issue I make no excuses in being biased in favour of scientific, egalitarian and humanistic values through seeking to bring some measure of objectivity to bear on the subject. Henryk Holowenko Deputy principal educational psychologist, London Borough of Tower Hamlets • At YoungMinds, we have welcomed recent government announcements: the increased funding for eating disorder services; the ending of children being detained under the Mental Health Act in police cells; and the establishment of a taskforce to review children’s mental health services. However, we are deeply concerned that the announced cuts to local government funding will be a significant step backwards. Funding for children’s mental health services comes from a variety of sources, not just the NHS. Local government plays a crucial role in many areas, especially for early intervention services, which the government itself recognises as vital in supporting children and young people, helping them before mental illness becomes entrenched. Earlier this year we revealed that almost two-thirds of councils had cut or frozen their budgets for children’s mental health services since 2010-11, with one making a cut of 94%. The 1.8% cut to local government funding is likely to further this trend. If local government no longer has the financial capacity to support early intervention in children’s mental health services, it is essential that these services are provided elsewhere. If they are not, and early intervention services continue to be cut, we will see more children and young people needing more intensive and more expensive support for mental illness, a situation that will cost millions and cause extreme distress and pain to thousands of young people and their families across the country. Lucie Russell Director of campaigns, YoungMinds • All the mental health charities you are supporting are doing excellent work, but your editorial (24 December) does not reflect the most recent thinking and practice. The British Psychological Society’s report Understanding Psychosis and Schizophrenia, praised by your columnist Clare Allen (theguardian.com, 2 December), argues that “professionals should not insist that people accept any one particular framework of understanding, for example that their experiences are symptoms of an illness”. Diagnosis is helpful for some, but others, even those with what you describe as a “critical illness such as schizophrenia”, see their distress as an understandable response to life events and circumstances. We all share your aim of reducing stigma and bringing mental health issues into the open. Biological views about chemical imbalances, faulty genes and so on are not only unproven but have been shown to increase fear and stigma. Avoiding uncritical use of the language of diagnosis and illness is an important step that the media can take towards changing attitudes.

{ "title":"David Cameron still more trusted on NHS than Ed Miliband, survey shows", "content": "Voters still trust David Cameron more than Ed Miliband on the NHS, despite Labour having made the health service the main focus of its campaigning since the summer, a survey shows. The ComRes poll shows that 22% say the prime minister is the party leader they most trust to manage the NHS, while 20% name the Labour leader. The gloomy news for Miliband is compounded by the survey’s finding that although Labour remains the most trusted party to manage the NHS, its lead over the Conservatives on that score has fallen to three points, the lowest level since ComRes first asked the question in June. One in four (25%) of the 2,069 adults interviewed online between 17 and 18 December identified Labour as the party they trusted most to manage the NHS. Polls usually produce the same finding. That was slightly up on the 24% Labour received in June, but four points down on the 29% it had in mid-October, which came soon after Miliband’s pledge at the party’s annual conference that a Labour government would give the NHS an extra £2.5bn a year to hire extra staff. In the latest survey, 22% named the Tories as the most trustworthy party on the NHS. Tory strategists are likely to be pleased given that the NHS has received a lot of negative publicity in recent weeks because of missed performance targets and problems with A&E units, GP surgeries and ambulance services as winter pressures have risen. However, other polls have shown Labour’s lead on health to be widening. Ukip, at 7%, was three points ahead of the Liberal Democrats, who have also pledged billions of pounds of extra funding for the service if they are in government after the general election on 7 May. That worrying trend for the junior partner in the coalition is confirmed by 6% identifying Nigel Farage as the party leader they trust most on the NHS, while just 4% plumped for Nick Clegg. Mike Birtwistle, a founding partner at the consultancy firm Incisive Health, which commissioned the survey, said: “Although Labour still leads the Conservatives on the NHS, Ed Miliband had failed to maintain a post-conference bounce on the issue. The fact he still trails David Cameron on what should be Labour’s strongest issue will be a major concern for Labour strategists so close to the election. “As we move into an election year, Labour, and in particular Ed Miliband, still have a good deal of work to do on health. A raft of policy initiatives have yet to translate into personal trust on the NHS. These findings will be a worrying reality check for Labour.” Liz Kendall, the shadow minister for care and older people, said the NHS was going backwards under the Tories, and Labour would be campaigning on A&E pressures, lengthening waiting times and staff recruitment problems between now and the election. “We know that people want positive alternative and credible policies to protect and improve the NHS. That’s why Labour has set out how we will invest an additional £2.5bn each year, over and above this government’s plans, to employ more doctors, nurses and community staff,” Kendall said. The survey also found that two-thirds of voters now say they are prepared to pay more tax to fund the NHS – the highest-ever proportion. Once don’t knows were excluded, 66% said they were willing to pay anything between 1p and 20p more on every pound earned to go directly to the NHS. That is up six points on the 60% who indicated such a willingness when ComRes asked the same question in July. The rise has come after all three parties have promised multibillion-pound cash injections for the NHS – George Osborne’s recent autumn statement guaranteeing an extra £2bn a year to help the service cope with rising demand – and NHS England’s blueprint for 2015-20 highlighted the need for significant extra funding. When asked about government spending on the NHS, 65% said it was not enough, 20% said the right amount and 4% felt it was too much, while 12% did not know. Nearly half (47%) identified “not enough funding” as among the most important challenges facing the NHS, while 45% said “not enough doctors and nurses” and 41% said “pressure on A&E services”. A government spokesman said: “This government is totally committed to the NHS and its values, which is why we announced in the autumn statement that the service would get £2bn extra, funding the necessary investment next year to back Simon Stevens’s [NHS England chief executive] five-year forward view. “We can make this down-payment on the NHS’s own long-term plan because of the strong economy we’re delivering and our additional investment over the course of this parliament means the NHS has already employed 13,500 more clinical staff.”",diasaster:0},

The strike is generally portrayed as a colossal defeat, for the miners, their communities and the trade union movement as a whole. It was. But one outcome that is less well known is the boost for LGBT rights in Britain. One of the co-founders of Lesbians and Gays Support the Miners (LGSM) was Accrington-born Mike Jackson. My generation all too often take for granted rights which were won because of the huge effort – and indeed sacrifice – of those before us. Though Jackson would be the first to say there is so much further to go, he fought for LGBT rights at a time of state-sanctioned homophobia and pandemic public prejudice. He put into practice “an injury to one is an injury to all”, a trade union slogan which is sometimes nothing more.

But one tribute stood out amid the gloom: BBC Wales’s dramatisation of Under Milk Wood, with a gathering up of 37 Welsh celebrities. The casting was absurdly glamorous: Tom Jones as Captain Cat and Katherine Jenkins as an implausibly floor-scrubbing Polly Garter. The vignettes were superb and brought each line of poetry to life. Bryn Terfel was an eloquent Reverend Eli Jenkins, Charlotte Church a stern Mrs Ogmore-Pritchard and Jonathan Pryce and Siân Phillips the murderous Mr and Mrs Pugh. Michael Sheen, Ioan Gruffudd, Griff Rhys Jones and Kimberley Nixon all put in appearances. The fact that most of the cast were beamed into Laugharne from wherever they were on duty – Cardiff, London, New York, Los Angeles, even Craig Roberts in a limousine – caricatured the production, but only as Thomas himself caricatured his home town. They lent the place a strange dignity. The power of the word elevated the petit bourgeois ambitions, lusts, jealousies and memories of Under Milk Wood, as Pip Broughton’s camera wrapped the roofs, streets and interiors in Thomas’s rich imagery.

{ "title":"Hard hat revolution: women targeted to fill vacancies as housebuilding revives", "content": "More women than ever are donning hard hats to work in property and construction. But in an industry faced with widespread skills shortages triggered by the latest spurt of housebuilding, progress has not always been rapid. “The industry is changing and it is changing for the better,” says Avni Mehta, deputy project manager on a £500m housing project at 190 Strand in central London. Seven of the 20 people on her team at developer St Edward are women – architects, people working on the commercial side or in administration. “That’s quite a high percentage for what would be considered a male-dominated industry,” she says. At St Edward, a joint venture between housebuilder Berkeley and insurer Prudential’s M&G property arm, 43% of staff are female. On site, Mehta, the secretary and a single contractor are the only three women out of 120 people, but she says: “The fact that we have one female operative is pretty significant. We had one on my last project, too, and I hope to see this increase on the project.” Mehta, 28, who trained as a civil engineer and previously worked on the tunnelling for London’s Victoria station upgrade, adds: “There’s a reason why a lot of women don’t want to [work on site]. It’s physically demanding. A lot more women could do it but why would you stand out in the rain for 12 hours a day?” Hourly rates for skilled construction workers have soared in the past year after 400,000 people left the industry during the recession. Figures in September showed the number of out-of-work bricklayers was the lowest in a decade. The proportion of women working in construction, however, has crept up over the past 15 years, to 13.4% in 2014 from 11.7% in 1999, according to the Office for National Statistics. Women account for 286,000 of a construction workforce of 2.1m. In manual roles, though, that percentage falls to just 1.3%, barely changed from 1.2% in 1999. Brian Berry, chief executive of the Federation of Master Builders, says: “It’s encouraging to see an increase in the proportion of women currently working in the construction industry compared to 15 years ago. The construction sector is facing an ever-growing skills shortage and, as the industry emerges from the worst recession in living memory, we are struggling to find enough skilled workers.” Some industry and government initiatives designed to attract people into construction specifically target women. The Royal Academy of Engineering runs a two-day course in developing skills for university and beyond for girls who are about to start engineering degrees. Mehta, who recently hosted a group of young women who had been on the course, welcomes such initiatives: “You don’t learn about engineering at school. I went to an all-girls school. Engineering wasn’t exactly one of the core subjects. My physics teacher said: ‘You’re good at physics and maths, have you thought about it?’ I said no.” She went on to do her master’s in civil engineering at the University of Bath, with sponsorship from Taylor Woodrow, and then worked for the housebuilder for four years. Last November, she joined St Edward where, as deputy project manager, she is responsible for the construction of 206 luxury flats and penthouses at the Strand development. In some parts of the industry, change has come faster. The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (Rics) says the number of female surveyors has risen from 2% in 1980 to 13% last year. Louise Brooke-Smith, who became the first female president of Rics this year and runs a property consultancy in Birmingham, says: “We’ve all got a war on talent, like accountants and lawyers. We have lagged behind but, boy, are we catching up.” But there are still woefully few female engineers. Women make up only 6% of the UK’s engineering workforce, down from 7% in 2013, according to the 2014 annual skills survey from the Institution of Engineering and Technology. The Royal Academy of Engineering says the UK needs to at least double the number of engineering graduates by 2020 to meet demand, with the industry needing an extra 830,000 professionals to replace those who left engineering and construction during the recession. The academy believes many of these new recruits will need to be women. A major problem is the low number of girls at school who study physics, a key subject for careers in engineering and construction. An Institute of Physics report in 2012, It’s Different for Girls, said almost half (49%) of state-funded, co-educational schools sent no girls at all to do A-level physics. A girl is four times more likely to take physics A level at a single-sex independent school than at a mixed state school. The Union of Construction, Allied Trades and Technicians (Ucatt) formed its first women’s network forum in March and highlighted the “harassment and bullying of women workers [that] continues to blight Britain’s male-dominated industries”. Suzanne Kervin, a bricklayer and roofer, told the TUC women’s conference in March about her experiences as the only woman working “on the tools” in her housing association. As a Ucatt delegate, she says: “Many women do not report bullying for fear of being labelled as complainers. Those that do are often ignored or ridiculed – accused of not being able to meet the demands of the job or told to develop a sense of humour. Deal with it or leave is the clear message.” Nicola Caiquo, a 24-year-old graduate who is training at the FTSE 250 housebuilder Redrow in London, says she has not experienced discrimination, although some people still look surprised when she turns up on site. “‘Oh you are a girl, you studied construction and you are out on site,’ but it’s a positive reaction,” she says. Being female “helps you to stand out. Any career in construction is about your attitude.” Mehta agrees, adding: “Maybe I get a little positive discrimination. I don’t get sworn at as much as my male counterparts.”",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"The Guardian view on Northern Ireland’s latest deal: the glass is half-full", "content": "The sight of Northern Ireland’s politicians haggling for days around the table, over issues that sometimes seem to belong to another era, can make it feel as if too little has really changed in the province. The gritty trading of the Stormont House agreement that was struck between the Northern Ireland parties just before Christmas offers some support for the glass-half-empty school of Northern Irish commentary. Yet, at the same time, the agreement contains just enough for those who prefer to continue to see the Irish glass half-full. It would be a mistake to dismiss the recent deal. The publication since Christmas, on both sides of the Irish border, of government papers under the 30-year rule is a timely reminder that much has in fact changed for the better. Thirty years ago, the IRA was bombing the British prime minister to within an inch of her life, while Dublin and London were rowing about redrawing the border to make Northern Ireland a still tighter territory. Meanwhile, according to one newly released document, a Democratic Unionist MP was making a call for “Libyan-type” UK bombing raids on nationalist communities north and south of the border. However annoying the recent poker game at Stormont has been, it is a lot better than bombing civilians. If reaching agreement is indeed better than reaching none, then the Stormont House package should also be welcomed in a spirit of realism. The agreement covers a range of disputes between the communities and parties which have threatened to bring down the power-sharing institutions. It contains more progress on the material issues that did most to trigger the latest impasse – principally over taxpayers’ cash to compensate for welfare reforms and over the vexed issue of corporation tax – than on the identity and cultural issues, such as parades, flags, language and the past. These last remain stubbornly unresolved, to the discredit of both sides. But at least there is now a framework for dealing with some of them, which there was not before. These are issues where kicking the can down the road may in fact be the least worst way of managing and containing the problem. The talks came very close, after 11 weeks of discussion, to falling apart, as earlier efforts under the chairmanship of Richard Haass had in fact done. It is good that the same did not happen this time. Yet there is precious little else to celebrate in the way the deal was reached. After 20 years of talking, it should not require the UK and Irish prime ministers, let alone the US president, to be even marginally involved in these processes. The expectation that they will should be broken. The brinkmanship that seems inescapable on such occasions has become self-indulgent and self-important too. It has less and less to do with events of global significance, and more and more to do with mere obduracy. The process appears to irritate public opinion, not to reassure it. Northern Ireland politicians should listen to that irritation and act to reduce it. They should not assume that the special conditions in Northern Ireland mean they are immune to the current anti-political mood across the rest of Europe.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Glasgow hosts Scotland’s first lesbian and gay marriages", "content": "Two couples have tied the knot on the stroke of midnight in Scotland’s first same-sex weddings. Joe Schofield and Malcolm Brown, both 42, and Susan Douglas-Scott, 54, and Gerrie Douglas-Scott, 59, are the first of 17 couples to marry on Hogmanay. MSPs passed the Marriage and Civil Partnership (Scotland) Act in February and more than 250 couples have converted their civil partnerships to marriage since the law came into effect on 16 December. Wednesday is the first day after the usual 15-day notice period for marriages that same-sex weddings can take place. Schofield, a public health worker, and Brown, a former DJ, both from Tullibody in Clackmannanshire, have been together for nine years and were married by Humanist Society Scotland celebrant Ross Wright at the Trades Hall, Glasgow. In a statement, they said: “We are very proud to be one of the first couples in Scotland to be able to officially call ourselves husband and husband. “This is an amazing chapter in Scotland’s history which we are all witnessing and can be proud of. “Scotland is leading the way in fairness and equality for all, and we would like to thank all those who campaigned so tirelessly for this change.” The Douglas-Scotts, who are both humanist marriage celebrants, live in Glasgow and have five grown-up children. They had a civil partnership in March 2006 and decided to convert it through a full marriage ceremony at a private venue in the city. The couple said: “We are delighted that, at long last, after 18 years together our love finally has the same recognition in law and society as all other married couples. “As humanist celebrants ourselves, we have had the privilege of marrying many hundreds of people over the last few years and so we know how special and important marriage is.” Both couples were joined by family and friends as well as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex (LGBTI) equality campaigners. First minister Nicola Sturgeon and Green MSP Patrick Harvie acted as witnesses at the marriage of the Douglas-Scotts, while Scots Makar Liz Lochhead and local government and community empowerment minister Marco Biagi acted as witnesses for Schofield and Brown. Biagi said: “With a new year nearly upon us, there really is no better way to celebrate than by watching these two people get married and make that lifelong commitment to each other. “I am proud of our parliament in passing the Marriage and Civil Partnership (Scotland) Act 2014, and proud of Scotland and the country that we are fast becoming. “One that is tolerant and fair and that recognises the rights of all its citizens regardless of race, gender or sexual orientation.” Tom French, policy and public affairs coordinator for the Equality Network, said: “This is a big day for many couples and their families, but it is also a milestone moment for Scotland as a whole. “After many years of campaigning, we have overturned discrimination in the law and same-sex couples now have the equal rights and recognition that they should always have been entitled to. “There is undoubtedly more that we need to do as a society to tackle prejudice and ensure equal treatment for LGBTI people, but today is a day of celebration and a chance to reflect on just how far we’ve come.”",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Tough year ahead for UK retailers, with supermarkets set to be hardest hit", "content": "Retailers are facing a tough 2015 with sales expected to grow by 2%, a similar level to this year, according to a retail thinktank. Continued low earnings growth, price deflation and uncertainty about the outcome of the election in May, as well as the potential resurgence of problems in the eurozone, are all likely to weigh down on consumer spending despite rising employment and improving consumer confidence, according to a group of retail industry experts brought together by KPMG and Ipsos. “Concerns around the outcome of the general election, coupled with a budget planned for later than expected on 18 March, could cause consumers to pause their spending while they wait for greater clarity,” said James Knightley, senior UK economist at ING, who sits on the panel. His concerns were echoed by Nick Bubb, an independent retail analyst, who suggested that VAT was also likely to rise this year whichever party ended up in power in May, as the government seeks new funds to help cut the country’s deficit. Food retailers will be hardest hit, according to the panel, with sales likely to fall by at least 1% as fierce competition from discounters, commodity deflation and austerity-minded shoppers take their toll. Grocers’ profits are also likely to suffer from shoppers’ continuing love affair with online purchasing, which is more costly to run than stores. The problems with home delivery encountered by Marks and Spencer and Debenhams on Black Friday and Waitrose and Sainsbury’s around 23 December show that UK retailers must invest more to ensure they can cope with spikes in demand, the panel said.",diasaster:0},

{ "title":"BBCSO/Oramo review – a bewitching poetic meditation", "content": "True Fire, Kaija Saariaho’s new song cycle for baritone and orchestra, was written expressly for Gerald Finley. He gave the first performance in Los Angeles last year, and was the soloist for the UK premiere too, with Sakari Oramo conducting the BBC Symphony Orchestra. The half-hour cycle interleaves settings of Ralph Waldo Emerson – three of his Propositions – with poems by Seamus Heaney and Mahmoud Darwish and a Native American lullaby. The prevailing tone is sombre and introspective, so the whole sequence becomes a meditation on the way we perceive the world around and how we relate to it. The music is predominantly static and much of it is very beautiful. As always with Saariaho, the orchestral textures that cushion and enfold the baritone’s lines are bewitching. Luminously coloured threads of sound, with harp and tuned percussion prominent, are woven into an ever-shifting, pulsing sonic web, which Oramo ensured never threatened to overwhelm the voice. But Finley’s superb theatrical and lyrical gifts are never exploited – much of the fifth poem, Darwish’s Farewell, is delivered parlando, for instance – and for all their harmonic subtleties the settings never really build any dramatic momentum. This is a work of contemplation and detachment mostly, which tends to keep the listener at arm’s length. The performance, from Finley and the orchestra, was exemplary. Oramo had taken over the concert at just a few days’ notice, after the original conductor, his Finnish compatriot Santtu-Matias Rouvali, withdrew through illness. He kept the programme as planned, and conducted every work in it superbly. Tchaikovsky’s Romeo and Juliet Fantasy Overture was the real revelation, not only thrillingly played by the BBCSO, but full of the telling detail and inner voices that so often get glossed over in performances that go for showboating effects. Even Prokofiev’s Fifth Symphony had real weight and presence, and seemed less noisily glib than it often does. Available on BBC iPlayer until 14 January.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"The Guardian view on Moomintroll: a hero for our time", "content": "Although the Swedish academy has awarded the Nobel prize for literature to seven people writing in Swedish, of all the world’s languages, it overlooked a woman who is almost certainly the best-loved Swedish-language author in the world, and one of the very best as well: Tove Jansson. Ms Jansson is mostly known for her creation of the Moomins, although she was a subtle and unflinching observer of love and death in her books for adults, too. But the Moomin books, more than most great children’s literature, transcend cosiness. They came from a background intensely serious about art and philosophy: the first sketch of Moomintroll appeared in the course of a furious argument with her brother about the philosopher Kant. But this passion flourished in a situation of great danger and insecurity. Finland was still part of the Russian empire when she was born in 1914. Independence was followed by a short, bloody civil war, then another war against Russia in 1939-40, then the second world war on the German side. The earliest Moomintroll books were mostly pictures, but even then there is real menace lurking in their shadows. Few authors have managed to convey an open-hearted domesticity as well as Tove Jansson – Moominmamma is patron spirit of Christmas hospitality – but the idyll of Moomin Valley is surrounded by wilderness and constantly threatened by flood and fire, comet and the wandering Groke. Moomintroll wakes alone from hibernation and wanders in a sunless world of snow. “If only there was anyone here I knew from before!” he thinks, “someone who wasn’t full of secrets, but was altogether ordinary…”. But he must make his way through a strange, enchanted world without his old friends. Are there any other children’s books with so many characters who are so obviously flawed, even though all are sympathetic? There are vain creatures – Snorkmaiden, beloved of Moomintroll himself, the Mymble, and the squirrel with the beautiful tail, who runs around the ice until he is frozen by the Groke, still admiring his own wonderful tail. Sniff is covetous and cowardly, the Hemulen pompous and pettifogging, and the Fillyjonk paralysed by neurotic terrors. Yet all of them are lovable, and all want love – even, in the last analysis, the fearsome Groke. This is echoed in Ms Jansson’s wonderfully precise manner of drawing the grotesque characters, so that they are at once absurd and delightful. Writing and drawing, she wrote, are both a matter of removing from the page everything but the right line. Like Emma the theatre rat who comes to the rescue of the Moomin family when their valley is flooded, she knew the transcendent importance of disciplined work. Perhaps the strangest power of her books, for English readers, lies in the overpowering presence of nature. The Moomins live in a world without cities, although there are a few towns, home to comical park keepers and other enemies of life. The river, the forest, and most of all the sea, are all sources of sudden overwhelming joy as well as terror and danger. This is a world where flowers are more valuable than jewels, and fruit juice the most delicious and healing elixir. Moomin Valley is our world, scrupulously observed and reassembled into something new and unfamiliar. Moomintroll, brave, absurd and loving, is a hero for all time. This article was amended on 17 December 2016. An earlier version incorrectly stated that Finland was occupied by the Red Army for four years after the end of the second world war.

{ "title":"Naz Shah MP: ‘Muslims are not one-size-fits-all’", "content": "I would be very surprised if anyone in Westminster knows more than Naz Shah about the challenges and rewards of integration. For that matter, there can’t be many people in the country who could bring more personal experience to bear on the matter than the Labour MP for Bradford West. Shah is the eldest daughter of a working-class Pakistani couple who settled in Leeds. When she was born in 1973, her father refused to pick the baby up because she was a girl. He used to beat her mother, who spoke no English and had no idea how to access support. When Shah was six, he ran off with a neighbour’s 16-year-old daughter. With her younger brother, pregnant mother, and their belongings bundled into bin bags, she had to abandon her home and move in with grandparents, fleeing the shame her father had brought on them. They moved 14 times in the following two years, to one unheated, rat-infested home after another; Shah contracted tuberculosis, but had to be her mother’s translator. “I became an interpreter at the age of six,” as she once put it. Eventually her mother sold her wedding jewellery and managed to buy a house, but only with the help of a neighbour’s married nephew, who demanded a sexual relationship in return. He, too, turned violent, and at 12 Shah was packed off to Pakistan for her own safety. When she was 15, relatives told her to marry her first cousin. If she refused, an uncle warned, even more of her relatives would fall out with her mother. The newlywed couple moved back to Leeds, but when her husband began to beat her – leaving one ear permanently damaged – Shah left him. Her mother could see no way to escape her own abuser, for she had nowhere to go. When his sexual interest turned towards her younger daughter, she poisoned him with arsenic. Too ashamed and fearful to tell the court of the abuse she had suffered, she was convicted of murder and sentenced to 20 years. It was left to Shah, still only 18, to bring up her 14 and 11-year-old brother and sister. Despite having left school at 12, Shah built an impressive career as an NHS commissioner and chair of a mental health charity. Now a single mother to three children of her own, she won Bradford West from George Galloway in 2015, only to be suspended by Labour earlier this year after antisemitic Facebook posts she had shared surfaced. The 43-year-old apologised profusely, was reinstated, and won praise this summer for forcing police in Pakistan to investigate the death of a female constituent. The family claimed their daughter had died of natural causes while visiting; she had in fact been the victim of an “honour” killing. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Naz Shah apologises ‘wholeheartedly’ for Israel remarks Who, then, could be better qualified than Shah to talk about integration? We meet after Muslims Like Us, a Big Brother-style BBC documentary about 10 British Muslim men and women aired this week. “I really liked it,” Shah smiles. “I thought it was very reflective of British society, I really liked the fact that you saw that we’re not one-size-fits-all, niqab-wearing, hijab-wearing radicals. We’re not everything that you read in some papers. We’re very diverse.” She is considerably less happy, however, about the Casey review, published last week, of “integration and opportunity in deprived and isolated communities”. Dame Louise Casey was given a tour of Bradford West by Shah while compiling her report, and it raises grave concerns about Pakistani or Bangladeshi enclaves segregated by poor English and “regressive” religious or cultural practices, where “far too many women [are] suffering the effects of misogyny and domestic abuse”. I hadn’t therefore expected the report’s loudest critic to be Shah. When the interview begins, I naively imagine that I will find out what Shah thinks it got wrong, and how to get integration right. Afterwards I wonder whether the MP is still too shaken by the antisemitism row to risk spelling out a clear position. Or perhaps integration is such an elusive conundrum that much clarity from anyone would be unrealistic to expect. All I know is that Shah spoke confidently, at great length, barely drawing breath, and I came away none the wiser. Working out what she really thinks is like trying to grab hold of a fish. Labour antisemitism row: Naz Shah's suspension lifted Read more Partly this is because she concurs (“I hear that, I get it”) with almost every opinion that comes up, which is a likable habit but makes hers rather hard to pin down. For example, “I recognise a lot of what Louise Casey’s talking about, because you have a community within a community; Bradford is referred to as Little Pakistan, I hear that, I get that. And I’m very vocal and outspoken about issues around patriarchy and misogyny and male-dominated clan politics. Where I fundamentally disagree is when someone fails to acknowledge that there’s government failings as well. Especially pertinent to Prevent.” The anti-radicalisation programme is notoriously unpopular among Muslims, so I’m not surprised when Shah says she has not met one in her constituency who has a good word to say for it. “But Prevent has to exist,” Shah quickly adds, “absolutely, and I’m the biggest advocate for a Prevent strategy.” What she cannot accept is Casey’s conclusion that “the government hasn’t been hard enough and hasn’t been strong enough”. She snorts. “Well, how much stronger? Prevent should have been about building resilient communities. It has turned into getting people to police people. That is not how we build resilient communities. The essence in communities has to be about building resilience. And how you do that is through community development.” I’m not sure what community development means, so ask what Shah’s version of Prevent would look like. “I tell you what it would look like. It would look like a safeguarding programme. If you get safeguarding right for children, you get radicalisation right. Because safeguarding covers all of that – building resilient children and resilient communities.” Facebook Twitter Pinterest Naz Shah at an election hustings in Bradford West in 2015. Photograph: Gary Calton for the Observer And how would that be delivered? “Through empowering children, by having brave conversations, having resilient conversations and questioning things. You empower children to ask questions. You empower communities to say: You need to be answering these questions. If we do it through safeguarding, the family then are empowered.” What if it’s the family preaching the extremism? “Well, then you need to take action. What would we do if a child was being abused?” For a moment I think we’ve arrived at an unambiguous and comprehensible statement, but when I try to confirm she is saying that a child radicalised by parents should be taken into care, she retreats with: “Well, it depends on what we call radicalisation. Religious conservatism is not radicalisation, there’s a difference. Let’s not conflate the two.” I ask her to define them, and she replies with an anecdote about walking to school as a child with a girl from a devout Christian family who wasn’t allowed a television. “I used to find that really, really – ‘Oh my God, you’ve not got a telly in the house!’ But does that mean that family was extreme? No it doesn’t, it’s just religious conservatism, how you choose to practise your life. So, for me, when people choose to have a way of life that might mean you don’t watch TV – what you do is you empower those children, you empower those young people, you empower those families, you have conversations with them and those conversations have to be very, very brave, because you’re setting your children up to fail if they don’t have access to social media and they are in mainstream school. Then you need to be talking to people. For example, if a child is in a faith school, if you’re dropping them off and picking them up, you’re not necessarily empowering them to use public transport and be resilient in the community, so you need to have conversations with people even if they’re home-schooling.” Who needs to have those conversations? I’m becoming lost. “People! Authorities need to have conversations with them people. But if they choose that lifestyle, as long as it doesn’t impact on the safeguarding, then is that a lifestyle choice? That’s the killer question, isn’t it.” Does Shah look at it as a lifestyle choice? “I think some people have legitimate lifestyle choices.” Is wearing the niqab a legitimate lifestyle choice? “I do not agree personally, on a personal level – and please, if you quote this, do not take it out of context – I do not agree with wearing the niqab, I just don’t get it, right? But when I’ve talked about it, people say: what’s the difference between wearing the niqab and having a full tattooed face? And I’m like, OK.” Does she consider them the same? “No, but that’s the response I got. And then, if you’ve got barristers who are qualified, who are absolutely very educated, and who have studied Islam and then they’ve gone to it – one of my friends, very very articulate, an amazing woman, I was driving one day and she said ‘Hi Naz’, and I didn’t know who the hell it was. And she’d done it out of choice, she is not an oppressed woman, I assure you, she sees it as her liberation.” Liberation from what? “From her – for her – for her feeling however she wants to feel. That’s her choice. And I was shocked at it. I struggle with the niqab.” The real issue, Shah feels, isn’t how people practice their faith, but poverty. “For me, that bit’s been missed by Louise.” Casey would presumably say that having no spoken English or any contact with the wider community are causes of poverty. Shah’s own mother would surely have been less vulnerable had she spoken English, and been able to earn enough to support her family? “Absolutely, absolutely. But it’s not just about speaking English. Integration is a two-way street, and that’s missing from the report. Naz Shah: ‘Honour’ killing may not be in your culture, but the problem belongs to us all Read more I ask what a white British family reading this should do to assist integration. Shah tells me about an educated, professional man she knew who was the first Muslim to move into a street of 28 other houses, and sent a card to each of them introducing himself. In return he received only two cards. Then she tells me that not long after she moved into her house – “in a nice area, I had a good job” – the white neighbours on both sides put theirs on the market. But just when I think she has made a concrete point – white Britons need to be more welcoming and neighbourly to Muslims – she adds: “My neighbours didn’t sell up because they don’t want to live next door to Asians. People naturally are just comfortable in their own communities. We gravitate towards people who look like us.” Does she mean we should stop fretting about integration? “What I’m saying is, it’s not about not worrying about integration, it’s about building resilient communities. And building resilient communities where there’s poverty, that will require integration. You have more chance of getting a decent job and getting out if there’s integration.” In the course of the conversation, Shah has by now used the term “resilient communities” at least 10 times. When I transcribe the tape later, I find whole paragraphs constructed almost entirely out of buzzwords – community development, empowerment, safeguarding, ownership of narrative, social mobility, two-way street – which sound like a sociologist’s new clothes to me, until I think hang on, what if they’re only meaningless to my white, secular perspective? If only I was more integrated, I would get it. So what exactly are, I ask, “resilient communities”? “OK, resilient communities are where people have the same opportunities, so equality – equality is a massive thing, so you will not have the same opportunities in Bradford West as you would in a middle-class area.” I would love to pretend that everything now suddenly makes sense, but am not sure it does.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"US travel ban leaves Iranian LGBT refugees in limbo", "content": "Gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender refugees from Iran have found themselves caught between a rock and a hard place after Donald Trump’s executive order banning entry for people from seven Muslim-majority countries. US travel ban puts 20,000 refugees in 'precarious circumstances', UN says Read more The order also suspended the US refugee admissions system for 120 days, and promised to prioritise members of religious minorities. But it made no mention of people facing persecution for their sexual orientation, and several gay Iranians who have fled a country where homosexuality is punishable by death are now left stuck in Turkey, where they say they are experiencing worse homophobic abuses than in their homeland. Some of the refugees have already had their asylum applications approved by the UN refugee agency and were due to be resettled in the US after months or even years of interviews and security checks. Mitra, a 27-year-old lesbian living in Denizli, a conservative city in south-west Turkey, left Iran in 2014 after receiving death threats because of her activities as the editor of Aghaliat, an online magazine focusing on LGBT issues. She was granted refugee status by the UN nearly two years ago, and was due to attend her final interview this month before being resettled in the US. “They have just called me and said it’s all cancelled,” she said. Until Trump’s ban came into force, the US was the only viable path to safety for gay Iranians who end up in Turkey. Canada no longer accepts them because it is focusing on Syrian refugees. European countries do not normally accept LGBT Iranians who have applied from Turkey. Like many of her fellow minorities, Mitra was initially approved to go to Canada. “I waited for 14 months, [and] even went through the medical checks but one day they called and said Canada doesn’t accept Iranians anymore and I should go to the US. Now that’s up in the air too.” Mitra added: “One by one all my dreams and hopes are being destroyed before my eyes. It doesn’t matter to me whether to go to Canada or the US, I just want to go somewhere – anywhere – safe.” Mitra currently lives with her partner in a tiny room with one sofa that is also their bed. “Iran doesn’t want us, Canada doesn’t want us and now the US doesn’t want us either. I have seen the suicide of three friends since 2015. A gay Iranian [threw] himself off a balcony and an Iranian lesbian hanged herself just eight months ago.” She argued that the US should also make exemptions for sexual minorities as well. “At least with religious refugees, they have the support of their families, we don’t even have that. Our families are [ashamed] of us.” Javad, 50, is a disabled Iranian gay man also living in Turkey. “I was abandoned by my family, I was abandoned by my country and now I [do not] have anywhere to go,” he said. He said two of his friends were beaten up in the street. “One day a friend of mine, an Iranian gay name Pouya, called and said, ‘forgive me’,” he said. “I realised he was about to take his life. “I am disabled, I struggled to get to his house, by the time I got there he had died. He had just had enough.” Saghi Ghahraman, the head of the Canada-based Iranian Queer Organisation, said LGBT Iranians face horrific punishment and bullying. A fatwa issued in 1987 by the late Ayatollah Khomeini legalised transexuality, but social stigma remains still rampant, and homosexuality is still punishable by death. “Up until 2013, the wait-time for the LGBT to be determined and resettled by the [UN high commissioner for refugees] in Turkey was about a year and a half, which was barely manageable,” she said. “But it changed with the war in Syria, and when the USA and Canada undertook resettlement of large number of displaced Syrians, the LGBT wait-time before resettlement went up to three years,” she said. Meanwhile, gay Iranian exiles have been subjected to a string of violent hate attacks and murders in Turkey, said Ghahraman. The 26-year-old Azad, a gay Iranian who was approved for relocation by the UN 23 months ago, said his friend fainted in the bus when he heard about Trump’s decision. “We’re stuck, we can’t go forward, we can’t go backward,” he said. “Turkey is so unstable too these days and anything can happen, what if they deport us back to Iran?”",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"UK house price growth has hit 14-month low, says Nationwide", "content": "UK house prices grew at their weakest annual rate in more than a year in January, in an early sign of the property market slowdown predicted for 2017. Annual growth edged down from 4.5% in December to 4.3%, according to the mortgage lender Nationwide. It was the weakest since November 2015. On a monthly basis, the average price of a UK home edged up 0.2%, to £205,240, following a 0.8% rise in December. Robert Gardner, Nationwide’s chief economist, said there were indications the housing market would soften in 2017, as household budgets come under pressure from higher consumer inflation at a time of weaker jobs and wage growth. UK housing market falters as estate agents become less optimistic Read more “The outlook for the housing market remains clouded, reflecting the uncertainty surrounding economic prospects more broadly,” Gardner said. “On the one hand, there are grounds for optimism. The economy has remained far stronger than expected in the wake of the Brexit vote. However, there are tentative signs that conditions may be about to soften. “The economy is likely to slow through 2017 as the squeeze on household budgets intensifies and heightened uncertainty weighs on business investment and hiring.” Nationwide predicts that growth in house prices will more than halve in 2017 to 2% from 4.5% in 2016. Howard Archer, the chief UK economist at IHS Markit, said conditions for house buyers were likely to deteriorate progressively during 2017. Inflation has already started to rise as the impact of the sharp fall in the value of the pound since the EU referendum feeds through to prices. A weaker pound makes imports from abroad more expensive. The headline rate UK inflation jumped to a two-and-a-half-year high of 1.6% in December from 1.2% in November, and is expected to rise to about 3% in the coming months. Looking back at trends over the last 60 years, Nationwide said the biggest gains in real house prices – comparing how much faster house prices have increased compared with goods and services more generally – were made in the 2000s. “These increases were spurred by a combination of strong and stable economic growth, a structural decline in interest rates and the further liberalisation of the financial system,” Gardner said. “In the decades ahead, real house price trends will continue to depend crucially on developments in the wider economy, though there is an even greater degree of uncertainty around this than usual.”",diasaster:0},

Critics of the ordinance, introduced by a government that won parliamentary elections in December, say it could reverse an anti-corruption fight in Romania that has drawn widespread praise internationally. Additional laws could be issued in the coming days, further eroding ministers’ accountability, according to the government’s opponents. In a post on Facebook, the Romanian president, Klaus Iohannis, who has opposed the emergency ordinance and who last month joined protesters on the streets, wrote: “Today is a day of mourning for the rule of law.” News of the ordinance passing broke at about 10pm local time, and by midnight local media estimated that 12,000 people were demonstrating in Bucharest and 10,000 in other cities across the country, despite freezing temperatures. There were shouts of “Thieves” and “You won’t get away with it.” “I don’t normally protest but I just felt such a sense of rage,” said Alexandra Boeriu, a 35-year-old NGO worker who protested outside the main government building in Bucharest. “I was young, but I did live through communism and I know what this is. I don’t want this for my kids. There are a lot of people protesting who want to have a future in this country.

If this is the kind of procedure they do, we wonder what’s next. It looks like anything is possible.” Protests have been held for the past two Sundays over the government’s plans, which would also grant amnesty to those sentenced to jail terms shorter than five years in relation to certain crimes and halve prison terms for those with young children, pregnant women, or those over 60. The EU has weighed in on the controversy, warning the government not to backtrack on anti-graft measures. “The fight against corruption needs to be advanced, not undone,” European commission head Jean-Claude Juncker and his deputy, Frans Timmermans, said in a joint statement. “We are following the latest developments in Romania with great concern.” Government officials have suggested the laws were aimed at easing overcrowded conditions in prisons, but few observers are convinced, and many believe the real purpose is to help convicted politicians, or those who are now under investigation, escape justice. Romania, an enthusiastic EU member for a decade and a major recipient of EU funds, remains one of Europe’s most corrupt countries: a report by the IPP thinktank released late last year found that of the 588 MPs elected in previous elections in 2012, 89 – or 15% – were either under investigation for graft, had already been convicted, or chose to step down for other positions. Hundreds of officials have been imprisoned in recent years, and more than 2,000 files are under investigation in relation to abuse of office, according to prosecutors. “With this government I feel insecure and the new law which favours corruption is a huge offence and an attack on us, the regular people,” said Alberto Grosescu, a 29-year-old photographer who took to the streets on Tuesday night immediately after the ordinance was announced. Grosescu predicts that many more people will come out to protest. “I’m pretty sure that tonight there is going to be over 100,000 people in Bucharest, maybe over 200,000 across the whole country,” he said. Those protesting hope that their actions could still lead to change. “They have to, I don’t think politicians can ignore so many people, but we have to stand up and continue to stand up,” said Boeriu. Thousands of people gathered outside the main government building in Bucharest on Wednesday morning. It is thought that protests later in the day could be the biggest since the fall of communism in 1989.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Who is Neil Gorsuch? A staunch conservative with a background to worry liberals", "content": "In a 2005 essay titled Liberals ’N’ Lawsuits, Neil Gorsuch, then a corporate lawyer in Washington, DC, argued that “American liberals” had come to rely too much on court decisions to advance “their social agenda on everything from gay marriage to assisted suicide to the use of vouchers for private-school education”. Published just months after the re-election of George W Bush, it was a remarkable bit of concern-trolling ahead of its time. If liberals really wanted to enact their agenda, Gorsuch wrote, they should focus on “trying to win elections rather than lawsuits”. Neil Gorsuch nominated by Trump to fill supreme court vacancy Read more Fast-forward 12 years. American liberals – and quite a few centrists too – have lost another election and many have once again turned their eyes to the courts, hoping for protection from what looks to many of them like a vicious attack by the executive branch on core rights and freedoms. If Donald Trump has his way Gorsuch will be in a position this time to do more than just write an essay. If confirmed by the Senate as the newest justice on the US supreme court, he will have unique power to help vindicate or frustrate liberals’ strategy. The announcement of Gorsuch’s nomination in a hyped White House spectacle on Tuesday night was greeted with expressions of concern on the left and robust cheer on the right. Carrie Severino, chief counsel of the conservative Judicial Crisis Network, hailed Gorsuch as a “principled constitutionalist” with “an obviously brilliant legal mind”. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Trump picks Neil Gorsuch for US supreme court “He is someone who is going to look at any question according to what the constitution itself says, setting aside his own political views” whatever they may be, Severino said. A partisan scrum has developed around the nomination nevertheless, with Democrats vowing a filibuster and the Republican senate leadership vowing a confirmation. The air of partisan controversy is not obviously rooted in Gorsuch’s track record as a circuit court judge, which does not include rulings on the kinds of hot-button social issues he alluded to in his Bush-era essay. Gorsuch’s disposition on abortion rights cases may be suggested in a line from a book he wrote about euthanasia, the subject of his doctoral studies at Oxford University. “To act intentionally against life is to suggest that its value rests only on its transient instrumental usefulness for other ends,” Gorsuch wrote. Nancy Northup, president and CEO of the Center for Reproductive Rights, said the onus was on the nominee to explain his position on the issue. “Given president Trump’s promise to appoint a supreme court justice that would seek to overturn Roe v Wade, we need to know whether Judge Gorsuch would do just that,” Northup said. The looming issues awaiting Donald Trump's supreme court nominee Read more “Our constitution guarantees a woman’s right to safe, legal abortion. Any effort to gut those protections would harm the rights and health of women for generations to come.” But beyond any single issue Gorsuch has articulated a judicial philosophy that emphasizes the primacy of the constitution and prizes the text of laws, while warning against judicial forays that might be mistaken for an attempt to shape or direct legislation. “Congress could have written the law differently than it did, and it is always free to rewrite the law when it wishes,” Gorsuch wrote in a ruling that argued for a new hearing for a felon convicted of firearm possession. “But in our legal order it is the role of the courts to apply the law as it is written, not some different law Congress might have written in the past or might write in the future.” In some ways Gorsuch seems likely to please social conservatives. He has repeatedly upheld claims of a religious exemption where the law would compel an individual to violate a personal spiritual belief. While the supreme court declined to consider one such “religious liberty” case in 2016, in which a family-owned pharmacy objected to a state regulation forcing it to sell emergency contraceptives, future cases in the area seem likely. In Hobby Lobby Stores Inc v Sebelius, Gorsuch argued that a retail store owner need not comply with a provision in Barack Obama’s health care law requiring employers to provide health insurance covering oral contraceptives. In his opinion Gorsuch gave wide berth to the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which asserts the religious liberty claim and which Gorsuch called a “super-statute”. Hannah Smith, a lawyer at the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, which represented Hobby Lobby in the case, praised the judge’s ruling. “That opinion is an example that he is a clear thinker, a clear writer on really complicated religious liberty issues,” Smith told the Guardian. “They were faced with a Hobson’s choice, to choose to abide by their religion or saving their business. I think he’s someone who would stand up for the religious liberty for all.” Elsewhere Gorsuch has ruled sympathetically in cases involving the erection of Ten Commandments monuments in public spaces and ruled against capital punishment defendants seeking relief from their sentences. In the integrity of his adherence to the principal of judicial restraint, as well as in the pithy eloquence – if he lacks a certain acerbity – of his opinions, Gorsuch is often compared favorably with the justice he would replace, Antonin Scalia, who died in February 2016. “His writing style has often been compared to Justice Scalia’s,” Severino said. “It’s very incisive, very clear and logical, but also very entertaining, and of course that was a hallmark of Justice Scalia’s own writing style.” Gorsuch spoke about Scalia’s death in an April 2016 speech at Case Western University. “I was taking a breather in the middle of a ski run with little on my mind but the next mogul field when my phone rang with the news,” Gorsuch said. “I immediately lost what breath I had left, and I am not embarrassed to admit that I couldn’t see the rest of the way down the mountain for the tears. He really was a lion of the law: docile in private life but a ferocious fighter when at work, with a roar that could echo for miles.” Gorsuch’s biggest difference with Scalia comes in the field of administrative law, an area that is sleepy for most laypeople but determines the scope of much government action. The Trump nominee has been a critic of “Chevron deference,” a doctrine that gives administrative agencies significant latitude with how they interpret federal statutes. His views, which are shared by a number of conservative legal scholars, would significantly weaken the federal government and allow the courts to override agency actions on issues ranging from immigration to health care to the environment. But several former colleagues of Gorsuch’s from across the ideological spectrum have called for Gorsuch’s confirmation, saying his temperament is distinctly different from Scalia. “Scalia’s writing seemed dismissive to the claims of gay rights,” said Melissa Hart, professor at the University of Colorado Law School who worked with Gorsuch. “Everything I know about Neil Gorsuch as a person leads me to believe he would not be dismissive of anyone’s claims, regardless of how he rules. I’m not saying I think he will rule in favor of LGBT rights but I don’t think he will be dismissive of anyone’s claims.” Hart said she believes Gorsuch is “more than qualified to be on the supreme court”, echoing an op-ed in the New York Times by Neal Katyal, a former acting solicitor general under Barack Obama, that called for liberals to back Gorsuch. “I understand the political reasons for wanting to block the nomination,” Hart said, “but I don’t think there’s a principled reason to reject Neil Gorsuch as a jurist.” Neil McGill Gorsuch was born on 29 August 1967 and grew up in Denver, Colorado. His family moved to Washington, DC, after Ronald Reagan nominated his mother, Anne Gorsuch Burford, to head the Environmental Protection Agency. Gorsuch attended Georgetown preparatory school, Columbia University, Harvard Law school and Oxford University, where he enrolled on a Marshall scholarship and earned a doctorate. He fits the mold of every sitting justice on the US supreme court in educational pedigree: they all went to Harvard or Yale for law school. Post-graduation, Gorsuch worked for a decade representing mostly corporate clients at the Washington law firm of Kellogg Huber Hansen Todd Evans & Figel. But Mark Hansen, the nominee’s former boss at the firm, told the Denver Post that Gorsuch was a “regular person”. “He acts and relates well to all people, and he did the same sort of thing in trial, where he was very good at making connections with jurors,” Hansen said. “He’s a regular person. It’s part of being a Westerner.” At Oxford, Gorsuch met his future wife, Louise Gorsuch, a UK citizen. With their two teenage daughters they lives outside Boulder, Colorado, where Gorsuch indulges hobbies including fly-fishing, hiking and rowing. After his 2005 essay subtly celebrating the re-election of George W Bush, Gorsuch got good news from the administration. Gorsuch was to be appointed to the 10th circuit appeals court, which covers all or part of Colorado, Kansas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Utah and Wyoming. In 2006, when it came time for the Senate to review his nomination, Gorsuch was confirmed in the most expeditious way possible, by a voice vote and encountering no objection. This time may be different. With reporting by Ben Jacobs",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"The Guardian view on Brexit: more haste, less speed", "content": "In the end, 47 Labour MPs decided to vote against the bill triggering article 50. Two more frontbenchers, Dawn Butler and Rachel Maskell, resigned in order to vote against Jeremy Corbyn’s ill-advised three-line whip. Many MPs, in two days of often deeply felt debate, said they felt bound to honour their voters’ wishes despite their belief that leaving the EU will be a disaster for the economy, and regardless of the majority for remain among people who would normally vote Labour. The difficulty of this vote for the party was etched on the face of the shadow Brexit secretary, Sir Keir Starmer, as he wove his way through the mess of conflicting ambitions that constitute current party policy. We would rather that the party had voted with its heart than, as it perhaps did, with an eye on its electoral prospects in leave areas like Stoke and Copeland. We would say the same about the Conservative remainers too. But Labour’s equivocations on Europe long predated the vote and will continue long after. Yet unless it can find a stronger position to unite around on such a central issue, Labour will struggle to be a credible party of opposition. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Brexit debate: the best Commons speeches, from Ken Clarke to Nick Clegg But Labour’s dismal performance is not the real scandal of Wednesday’s vote, and those who pretend it is are playing the leavers’ game. The real scandal is that, with the distinguished exception of Ken Clarke, the Tory party’s many remainers bent the knee. As a result, the government had an overwhelming majority on the second reading of the bill to trigger article 50. Its failure to publish a white paper before the debate went unpunished. This disregard for the most basic of requirements for a decision of such consequence must not be allowed to be a taste of things to come. It is all the more alarming that, as late as Tuesday, it seems no draft had been circulated: the home secretary, a member of the small group of senior ministers who sit on the cabinet committee on Brexit, told MPs she had not seen it. Yet, even as the potentially grim consequences of Brexit become clearer, Theresa May’s timetable for the process of departure remains on track. It is not all over, however. Everything is still possible. Now the prime minister must come clean about the choices that lie ahead, and their consequences – and she must convey to the whole of Britain the scale of the task ahead. Even without a white paper, it is clear that she puts controlling borders and repatriating law at the head of her list of priorities. It is also clear, as George Osborne told the Commons, that at the head of the EU’s list is the integrity of the union of the remaining 27 members. Those governing ideas will, unavoidably, make many of the other ambitions that Mrs May set out in her speech a fortnight ago extremely challenging. The negotiations will be just that – negotiations that must be conducted with the intention of reaching an agreement that is acceptable for both sides. It is an irony that Mrs May will not appreciate that the European court of justice from which she so ardently wishes to escape is highly likely to be called in to adjudicate on aspects of the final deal, as its president Koen Lenaerts points out. Mrs May talks ominously about no deal being better than a bad deal, and claims to be prepared to crash out on World Trade Organisation terms. This is a terrible strategy. As the SNP’s Westminster leader, Angus Robertson, put it at prime minister’s questions, Mrs May has made one successful foreign trip in the past week. That was her trip to Dublin, where she and the Irish taoiseach, Enda Kenny, discussed how best to preserve the free trade area and protect the Northern Ireland peace process. She would do well to take the lesson about the value of negotiations conducted in good faith and a spirit of cooperation. A hard Brexit would be ruinous. Every MP should spend the coming week consulting their local businesses on the impact of WTO terms, and calculate their likely impact on jobs and prices. The referendum itself has been a catastrophe. But if Mrs May continues to treat leaving the EU as if it can be achieved in a couple of years of hard work, she is doing the voters a grave disservice. She knows the cost of making pledges on immigration that are unachievable. Suggesting that Brexit can be done and dusted before the next election is a deceit on a monstrous scale. As Sir Ivan Rogers, the former UK ambassador to the EU, told MPs on the Brexit committee on Wednesday morning, the task ahead was “humongous”. It would, unavoidably, be bloody. This will be a long game, and the government must say so.",diasaster:0},

{ "title":"AirAsia flight QZ8501: families receive brutal confirmation of lost plane’s fate", "content": "Two and a half days after the plane carrying their loved ones vanished from radar screens over the Java Sea, the anguished relatives crowded into a room already assumed the worst. But the confirmation came in a particularly brutal way: live television coverage showed a half-naked, bloated body floating in the sea. Many people began crying hysterically. Several fainted and had to be carried out of the room at Surabaya’s airport, the starting point for the ill-fated AirAsia Indonesia flight QZ8501 that departed early on Sunday morning. “You have to be strong,” said the mayor of Surabaya, Tri Rismaharini, as she comforted relatives. “They are not ours, they belong to God.” But one woman, dressed in an AirAsia uniform, raged at the TV. “Is it possible for you not to show a picture of the dead?” she shouted. “Please do not show a picture of a dead body.” A man awaiting news of his younger brother said the relatives had been calm before the broadcast of the grisly images, shot from a search helicopter, showing a body floating face down, clad only in underwear and socks. “But the atmosphere was very different after the footage of a dead body was shown,” said Munif, 50, who in common with many Indonesians uses one name. “Families became hysterical.” Dwijanto, 60, awaiting news of his son, told the AFP news agency that the images extinguished any hope for him. “My heart will be totally crushed if it’s true. I will lose a son,” he said. The channel involved, Indonesia’s TVOne, apologised. However, the news the relatives had all feared was fast emerging nonetheless. After two days of fruitless searching for the Airbus A320-200, shortly after midday local time search planes spotted what appeared to be an aircraft door, an emergency slide and other debris in the water. It was six miles from where the airliner, carrying 162 passengers and crew from Indonesia’s second city to Singapore, vanished shortly after requesting an altitude change to avoid a storm. Officials said the debris appeared to be red and white, the colours of AirAsia. Bambang Soelistyo, the head of Indonesia’s national search and rescue agency, told a press conference that spotters had also seen what appeared to be a “shadow” on the relatively shallow seabed, possibly the main wreckage. As dusk fell over the search site the airline’s parent company, Malaysia-based AirAsia released a statement saying Indonesian officials had formally confirmed that the debris came from flight QZ8501. By nightfall, search and recovery teams – which included around 30 ships and 15 aircraft from nine countries – had recovered a number of bodies, estimated at around 40, as well as more debris and some personal possessions, including a blue suitcase, unopened and undamaged. Tony Fernandes, the flamboyant Malaysian tycoon who founded AirAsia and is also chairman of Queens Park Rangers football club, said the news left him “absolutely devastated”. He met a number of the relatives at the airport to apologise personally and offer his condolences. “The passengers were on my aircraft and I have to take responsibility for that,” Fernandes told reporters. “It’s an experience I never dreamt of happening and it’s probably an airline CEO’s worst nightmare.” It is the airline’s first fatal incident, and on Tuesday another AirAsia plane made an emergency landing. Passengers on board a flight to Kalibo, in the Philippines, tweeted photos of the plane with its emergency chutes deployed after it apparently overshot the runway while landing in bad weather. Indonesia’s president, Joko Widodo, who visited the airport to meet the families and talk to Fernandes, said all efforts would be devoted to recovering the remaining bodies and the wreckage as quickly as possible. In a brief statement to the press he said the waters around the crash site appeared to be around 25 metres in depth, relatively easy for scuba divers to reach. The shallow seas – around 1% of the depths involved in the ongoing search off Australia for Malaysia Airlines flight MH370, which disappeared without trace in March – should make it more straightforward to locate the plane’s black box flight recorders and thus, possibly, to discover why it crashed. Nonetheless, weather conditions were challenging, with navy officials saying waves were three metres high. Fernandes said the pilot, named in reports as Captain Iriyanto, was “extremely experienced”, with 20,000 hours of flying time. Fernandes appeared to blame the weather, saying: “There were some very unique weather conditions and let’s wait for the investigation to be concluded.” An Indonesian investigator, speaking to Reuters anonymously, said the inquiry was focusing on when the crew decided to ascend to avoid the bad weather. “We know that the weather was very bad in this area, there was a storm,” the official said. “Why did he [the pilot] request to climb at that stage? Should he have climbed earlier? Other aircraft were flying at a higher altitude in that area. How did the two pilots react to the weather? We are asking those questions.” In the meantime, the relatives of those on board, among them 18 children and infants, must wait to learn what happened, and hope their bodies can be recovered. Fernandes said the devastating news at least meant relatives were no longer holding out hope in vain. Some at Surabaya’s airport agreed. Agus Panjaya, a 36-year-old businessman, had been awaiting news of his grandmother, and his aunt and uncle, as well as their three children. “Of course we feel sad about our loved ones but we had prepared ourselves for the worst,” he told AFP. “Before this everything was unclear. At least there is now some form of closure.”",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Scottish nurse who caught Ebola in Sierra Leone was ‘terribly committed’", "content": "A nurse of 16 years, Pauline Cafferkey was inspired to become a health worker after watching TV footage of the Ethiopian famine in the 1980s. And when the NHS appealed for volunteers to help treat Ebola patients in west Africa, the 39-year-old community nurse at Blantyre health centre in South Lanarkshire immediately put herself forward. “For me, it was kind of a natural thing; I couldn’t think of any reason not to go,” she told the BBC’s Good Morning Scotland a day before flying to Sierra Leone. Asked by the BBC interviewer whether she felt excited, nervous or worried about her trip, Cafferkey replied: “Everything. All of the above. An awful lot of emotions I’m going through just now. I’m looking forward to getting there, getting my feet on the ground and getting stuck into it.” She said she hoped her family would be proud of her – even if they were worried about her catching the virus. “You’ve got to have a certain element of fear there. You don’t want to go into this being complacent.” Dr Martin Deahl, a fellow volunteer who sat next to Cafferkey on the return flight to Heathrow, said she seemed “absolutely fine”. He spoke fondly of the nurse he got to know during 10 days of precautionary training in York before they were dispatched to different treatment centres in Sierra Leone. “She was quiet, unassuming, terribly committed to what she was doing, just a normal nurse,” he said. Deahl said he had attended a church service on Christmas Day and that Cafferkey was likely to have contracted the disease while visiting the local community without wearing a full hazard suit. While in Sierra Leone, she worked at Kerry Town treatment centre, one of the busiest makeshift hospitals in the country. The 80-bed facility has treated more than 200 patients since opening on 5 November, according to Save the Children, and has cured 66 people. In a moving diary for the Scotsman, Cafferkey told how she found the experience mentally and physically exhausting, at one point vomiting out of a minibus window and having dreams about the virus. “My nice community-nursing job in Blantyre is far removed from this but at the moment this seems a lot more real. The dreams that I do remember always seem to have an Ebola theme, it seems to be all consuming,” she wrote. Her time there did not get any easier. By the third week, Cafferkey described how she consoled a distraught boy who had lost both his parents and his sister to Ebola. “The sad thing is that this is a regular occurrence and we see and hear of whole families being wiped out by this awful disease,” she said. Cafferkey, who is thought to live with her parents Jean and Michael in a cul-de-sac in Fife, wrote about how she felt fortunate to have a few hours of electricity and cold running water in the coastal shack that housed the volunteers. “This is basic stuff but I’m not here for a holiday. Being coastal, we are very fortunate to get to walk along a beautiful beach every day to get to the hotel that serves our food,” she said. “Although I don’t get to see a great deal of Sierra Leone, from the journey to work and the area surrounding where we are staying, I can tell it is a country of immense natural beauty. Not only that, but we pass a small mangrove with crocodiles every day, not your average walk to work.”",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"2014: a good year for democracy?", "content": "More than 1.5 billion people voted around the world in 2014 in over 100 elections that endorsed the appeal of democracy as an idea, if not always as a system of government. The polls ran from the vast and complex to tiny local affairs in which most voters knew each other, and which might have seemed familiar to the Greek city states that pioneered the idea of citizens choosing their own leaders more than two millennia ago. On the Caribbean island of Montserrat, fewer than 3,000 people cast ballots for a new legislative assembly, but they represented almost three-quarters of eligible voters. In India, by contrast, the presidential election was such a huge logistical challenge that it went on for weeks, allowing more than 500 million people to take part – a full two-thirds of citizens with the right to vote. The highest turnout, perhaps not surprisingly, was in authoritarian North Korea, where the government said that almost no one missed the chance to vote. The enthusiasm in a system of ruthless control probably owes more to fear than any wish to express an opinion. Such is the grip of democracy that only a small handful of countries, including Qatar and Saudi Arabia, have no form of national-level vote. All others hold some kind of election, whether they be empty shows like Pyongyang’s ballot, fraudulent or at least partially compromised. “Democracy has an appealing image of a system that gives people freedom and independence. So [countries such as] North Korea … claim to be democratic republics to draw on this imagery,” said Russell Dalton, professor of political science at the University of California. “Even if citizens see democracy as a positive feature, political elites in these nations do not want to yield power. So elections are used to give the appearance of democracy without the threatened loss of power to elites.” The relative success of countries that pioneered modern democracy have contributed to its popularity, said Professor Pippa Norris, at Harvard University’s Kennedy school of government. “The good news is that the public does support democracy, but doesn’t always understand it in the way it is understood in the west,” Norris said. “They think of it as prosperity, peace, stability and an effective state.” That enthusiasm can easily turn sour if new governments struggle to make real change. Elections imply accountability, but they do not in themselves transform a country’s finances or make its government more efficient. “People build tremendous hope into democracy, but to be able to deliver you need an effective state as well as an effective election system,” Norris said. “If you don’t have a state which can deliver things, then you are basically having elections which can’t deliver on their promises.” The failure of leaders hampered by a lack of funds or real power is one of the main reasons that new democracies falter, she said, adding that worldwide democracy was “somewhat in recession” - a view backed by the Washington-based thinktank Freedom House in 2014. “For the eighth consecutive year, [we] recorded more declines in democracy worldwide than gains,” the 41st annual edition of its Freedom in the World report found, warning of serious setbacks in “large politically influential countries” including Egypt, Russia, Turkey and Indonesia, and the rise of “modern authoritarianism”. Violence and disease also undermine democracy, the election data shows, with low turnouts in Afghanistan, which has been battling an insurgency for years, and Liberia which is grappling with Ebola. In the latter, health precautions including the strict separation of voters did little to reassure voters, and only one in four showed up. Turnout was also low in many of the western nations that pioneered the idea of ordinary people choosing their leaders. In the US only a third of eligible voters took part in mid-term elections for the houses of Congress. This disengagement, and the scepticism that drives it, is often seen as damaging to democratic governments that claim authority based on popular support. It can, however, also be read as the ultimate triumph of a system that aims to give ordinary people information and power, Dalton said. “Nations with a sceptical public actually have a more effective and accountable government because citizens press government to be responsive and perform,” he said. “All this is lost in the tendency of academics and political commentators to lament the allegiant, deferential citizen of the past. Assertive citizens make democratic politics more difficult and stressful, but it also makes for better democratic politics.” Interactive",diasaster:0},

Speaking during the recording of his Channel 4 series, Jamie and Jimmy’s Friday Night Feast, Oliver revealed that in 2001 Jackson had offered to fly him to the set in New Zealand and give him a cameo part playing a hobbit in the final film in the trilogy, The Return of the King, in exchange for cooking the director’s 50th birthday meal. The chef expressed his regret that he had not been able to take up the offer because of prior commitments and described it as “the worst thing that happened to me”. He said: “I got phoned up by the exec producer and asked did I want to go and cook for Peter Jackson’s birthday, the big birthday. “And if I did, they would fly me over and I could be a hobbit in the film. But I was working, I couldn’t get out of it.” He added: “I really wanted to do it, I would have got right into it as well, I would have taken the costume home and said ‘Jools, let’s make love!’.” Oliver, who runs a global chain of restaurants, Jamie’s Italian, as well as having a range of kitchenware, has built up an estimated wealth of around £240m since he made his first television appearance on the BBC as the Naked Chef in 1997. The first episode of Oliver’s new six-part series, which is filmed in a pop-up cafe on Southend pier in Essex, is due to be screened on 2 January, with guests including Hugh Bonneville, Tinie Tempah and Michael Sheen.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Chinese warship seizes US underwater drone in international waters", "content": "The Chinese navy has seized an underwater drone in plain sight of the American sailors who had deployed it in international waters, in a seemingly brazen message to the incoming Trump administration. According to a US defence official, the unmanned glider had come to the surface of the water in the South China Sea and was about to be retrieved by the USNS Bowditch, an oceanographic and surveillance ship, when a Chinese naval vessel that had been shadowing the Bowditch put a small boat in the water. Chinese sailors in the small boat came alongside the drone and grabbed it despite the radioed protests from the Bowditch that it was US property in international waters. The incident happened about 100 miles north-west of the Philippines’ port of Subic Bay. The US has issued a formal protest and demanded the return of the glider. Peter Cook, the Pentagon press secretary, said the Bowditch made radio contact with the Chinese ship and asked for the glider to be returned. “The radio contact was acknowledged by the [Chinese] navy ship, but the request was ignored,” Cook said. Where the drone was captured “The UUV [unmanned underwater vehicle] is a sovereign immune vessel of the United States. We call upon China to return our UUV immediately, and to comply with all of its obligations under international law.” The aggressive Chinese gesture comes at a time of rising tensions between China and the US in the South China Sea, where Beijing has claimed ownership of a number of reefs and small islands – which it is in the process of militarising – while the US navy has been conducting patrols nearby to assert freedom of navigation in the sea lanes. The tension has spiked since Donald Trump was elected in November. The US president-elect quickly broke a 37-year protocol by taking a call from the president of Taiwan, and openly questioned Washington’s longstanding “one China” policy that does not recognise Taiwan as a separate state. Beijing has signalled it would respond dramatically if Trump implements a break in policy once he takes office on 20 January. In recent days, China has conducted bomber patrols close to Taiwan in a flexing of its military muscle. Facebook Twitter Pinterest China warns Trump of damage to bilateral relations The seizure of the drone is also a reflection of the struggle occurring under the surface of the South China Sea. As China develops a strategic submarine fleet, with the potential to carry nuclear missiles out into the Pacific Ocean, the US has built up a monitoring network designed to spot Chinese submarines as they leave their bases. Drones are key to the network, and there is a race under way between major naval powers to develop drones that can work together in swarms and “see” long distances through the water. Underwater gliders are drones that can stay underwater on the lookout for submarines for long periods of time. “This looks like signalling from the Chinese in response to Trump’s Taiwan call,” said Bonnie Glaser, the director of the China Power Project at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies. “It is hard to believe this is the action of an independent commander. The Chinese now have much better control over the military, particularly the navy. It is in China’s interest to send signals before Trump is inaugurated, so that he gets the message and be more restrained once he is office.” Sebastian Brixey-Williams of the British American Security Information Council said: “Nuclear states are increasing anxious about unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs, or underwater drones) autonomously tracking their nuclear ballistic missile submarines (SSBNs), making them vulnerable to antisubmarine warfare. This is an issue for China in particular, whose SSBN fleet is small and noisy. Though the USNS Bowditch is an oceanographic ship and may sound harmless, the kinds of data it is collecting will make Chinese submarines easier to find over time. “China therefore accomplishes a number of things by seizing a US underwater drone,” Brixey-Williams said. “It allows Chinese scientists to better understand the US’s offensive technical capabilities in this area, and potentially allows them to reverse-engineer them, bringing gains in both the commercial and military spheres.” How to contact the Guardian securely Read more Glaser pointed out that the Chinese have frequently tested the US when there is a new administration. In the early months of the George W Bush administration, in 2001, the Bowditch was involved in a close encounter with a Chinese frigate which turned on its gun control radar and forced it to retreat. A week later there was a collision between a US spy plane and Chinese warplane off China’s Hainan island. At about the same point in the early Obama administration, in March 2009, a number of Chinese navy ships harassed another US oceanographic vessel, the USNS Impeccable, coming as close as 50ft away, trying to snag its acoustic equipment with hooks, waving flags and demanding the Impeccable leave the area.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Hundreds of Calais child refugees have UK asylum claims rejected", "content": "Hundreds of child asylum seekers in France who had been expecting to come to the UK have been told that the Home Office has rejected their claims. The children and teenagers dispersed from Calais in October have been advised to lodge their applications in France instead. The Home Office confirmed that the transfer of children previously in the Calais camp and now in French reception centres had ended, and said those it had decided could not come to the UK had been given advice about how to claim asylum in France. A spokeswoman said more unaccompanied children were undergoing initial screening in Italy and Greece and may also be brought to the UK. According to the Home Office, 750 children have been brought to the UK, but there were 1,900 registered after the Calais refugee camp was demolished. One 15-year-old Eritrean boy, Taher, said all 14 boys in his centre run by the Taizé community, a monastic order, were devastated by the news. “I have been on hunger strike since Sunday, drinking only water and coffee to protest about the unfairness of the Home Office keeping us waiting for so long. We haven’t been able to go to school or anything while we have been waiting. And now we have heard this very bad news,” he said. Please help us help #childrefugees survive the winter - Guardian/Observer 2016 Appeal Read more Taher said many of the boys were planning to run away rather than claim asylum in France, where they were distrustful of the authorities after witnessing police violence against inhabitants of the Calais camp. “Some will try to get to the UK on a lorry from Belgium. I think I will go back to Calais and try to get to England that way,” he said. Toufique Hossain, the director of public law at the UK-based Duncan Lewis solicitors, who is representing a large number of asylum seeker children dispersed across France, said he and his team had received reports on Friday from more than 12 children they are representing, all of whom are at different centres. “From the reports we have received it seems as if this is an organised operation between the Home Office and the French authorities. The children have been told verbally that their asylum claims have not succeeded, but they have not been given any reasons why in writing. This is absolutely shocking.” Hossain added: “The children are very upset but we are telling them not to run away.” Although the Home Office recently issued guidance saying it would prioritise under-15s from Sudan and Syria, he said he assumed that officials would then consider the cases of the other children dispersed around France. Calais child refugees on partial hunger strike after transfers to UK stop Read more “These children are very vulnerable. They have just been told verbally that they can’t come to England without an appropriate adult present to help them deal with this news. We are now looking to see what we can do legally to challenge the fact that the Home Office have failed to provide us with written reasons why they have rejected the children’s asylum claims.” Rebecca Carr, Taher’s legal representative, said he was a highly intelligent boy who had been offered a scholarship at a school in the UK if he was able to get there. She added that he had worked hard to learn English and said the fear now was that many of the children would run away after receiving the news. “I’ve been waiting and hoping for more than three months that I will be able to come to England,” said Taher. “I was in Calais for two months and have been in this centre for more than one month. There are 14 of us here who have received this bad news. The British government and the Home Office have been playing games with us. It has always been my dream to come to the UK because I love hearing British accents. “Whenever I hear a British accent I feel happy so I think if I can come to the UK and hear British accents all the time I will be happy for the rest of my life. If I can come to the UK I want to study to be a doctor so I can help people. And I love Manchester City and One Direction and can see them if I reach the UK.” A busload of child asylum seekers were brought from France to the UK last Friday, but it is thought that was the last of the Calais transfers. Charities have expressed concern about the children left behind and warned that more unofficial camps will spring up. Children with close family members in the UK may be eligible to come under rules known as the Dublin regulation. Under an amendment to the Immigration Act proposed by the Labour peer Alf Dubs, some vulnerable children without family members in the UK are also eligible to come to the UK. A Home Office spokeswoman said: “We have been working with the French authorities to bring children eligible to come here and more than 750 children have arrived so far. We are working closely with the French authorities to ensure the remaining children in their care are provided with information on how to claim asylum in France. “The current phase of transfers is being concluded. This is a planned process, done in conjunction with the French authorities. We have interviewed all the children who were transferred from the camp to the children centres in France. Those transferred to the UK include all Dublin cases where the family relationship has been verified.” She continued: “Between the start of the year and 10 October, over 140 unaccompanied asylum seeking children were accepted for transfer from Europe to the UK under the Dublin regulation. In addition, the UK has taken over 750 unaccompanied children from France following the closure of the Calais camp – under both Dublin and Dubs. “The Dubs process has not ended. More eligible children will be transferred from across Europe, in line with the terms of the Immigration Act, in the coming months. This could include children from France, Greece and Italy. “We are working closely with partners across Europe – including the Greek and Italian authorities, the UNHCR and NGOs – to further enable this process and have seconded an expert to Greece, where hundreds of unaccompanied children have undergone initial screening. We also have a longstanding secondee in Italy to support efforts to transfer children to the UK.”",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Tracey Emin to swap London for Kent after losing planning battle", "content": "Tracey Emin is planning to leave east London, where she has lived and worked for decades, after a losing a protracted battle with Tower Hamlets council to expand her art studio, she has told the Guardian. The Turner prize-nominated artist was refused planning permission to build a studio and living space adjoining her Spitalfields studio space after the project faced vocal opposition from local conservation groups. Now she says she plans to search for a new space on the Kent coast, where she grew up, after withdrawing her appeal against the refusal last week. “Why would you want to be somewhere you’re not wanted?” she said, discussing the project in public for the first time. “What I’m going to do now is move out of London. I don’t have any choice on that … There’s places now in Britain that are desperate for artists – Margate’s thriving, Folkestone, Hastings. All that Kent coast. And I could have a giant studio and be really relaxed.” Emin says she is joining a wave of artists leaving London, although she faces fewer financial constraints than most. “A lot of the creative people are having to move out of London because it’s not conducive,” she said. “Berlin, for example, helps artists build studios, helps them find land. Berlin understands that having artists inside the inner city is good karma, interesting.” Her decision to withdraw from the fight to extend her base in Spitalfields was due in large part to the death of her mother, Pam, two months ago. “I was going to have my mum live there. That was part of my big plan … And that’s not going to happen now,” she said. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Tracey Emin at her studio in east London in 2009. Photograph: Karen Robinson for the Observer Bereavement also made Emin reassess whether she wanted to fight on. “I’m in a vulnerable place right now,” she said, describing the prospect of appearing at formal appeal hearings as daunting. “I was scared about having to take all these people on my own – it’s a big thing.” Emin had planned to demolish a listed 1920s property to build a studio, showroom and living space designed by the Stirling prize-winning studio David Chipperfield Architects. It would have been connected to the existing studio and offices she converted in 2008, which she says are too small for her needs. “I’m an international artist who hasn’t got enough room to swing a cat at the moment,” she said, sitting on a couch in her studio, a high-ceilinged room lined with paintings in progress and dominated by a giant plaster maquette of a woman’s torso. The basement houses a softly lit swimming pool, and upstairs are two floors of offices, one of which is currently being renovated, where eight staff work. “It does feel like a huge amount of space but I can assure you it’s not, especially compared to some of my male counterparts,” she said. Chipperfield’s design would have been “a dream come true for Tower Hamlets”, Emin said, particularly as he rarely does private buildings: his current projects include remodelling the Royal Academy of Arts in London and the Mughal Museum in Agra, India. The plans would have allowed her to live and work on the same site – something she said was increasingly important with age. “As an artist you work till five in the morning … You don’t have 9-5, you work when it takes you,” she said. “I’m a single woman and I walk home.” She bought the site on Bell Lane for £3.5m in 2013, when it had planning approval for a scheme that involved demolishing most of the building but keeping two facades, and building a five-storey apartment block. But her new proposal to demolish the existing building at 66-68 Bell Lane drew stiff local resistance, with nearly 60 objections lodged with the council. One described the design as “ugly, an eyesore and a triumph for money over the preservation of local history, style and local aesthetics”. Emin said conservation officers were supportive of the plans when they were consulted during the design stage, but the planning committee ruled against it in February. Emin says she has been wounded by the opposition she faced from a community where she has worked since 1993, and where she lives in a listed Georgian house. “It’s not like I’ve just come in and saw it as a financial opportunity … If I knocked it down and built a hotel or flats I could greatly benefit. I could build eight, nine, 10 flats in here. But instead I employ people.” She has found the tone of the debate hurtful. “I just feel I’ve been pretty bullied by the whole thing and I don’t want to be bullied any more … I don’t get the reaction I get from people,” she said. Emin, who is currently on a year’s sabbatical, intends to keep her existing studio and offices, and her house, but to move her main base out of the area. “Tower Hamlets says we don’t want you … well, there’s plenty of other places that do. It’s that simple,” she said. “My mum’s death brought home to me what it is I really need, what it is I want at the moment. I want my mum, and that’s never going to happen again, and I’ve got to find a way of going forward and being able to do my work.”",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Five Star Movement dealt blow as aide to Rome mayor is arrested", "content": "Italy’s Five Star Movement (M5S) has been dealt a significant blow following the arrest of a top aide to the mayor of Rome, Virginia Raggi, an anti-corruption crusader who was swept into power this year on the promise that she would clean up the city. The arrest on Friday of Raffaele Marra, who has been nicknamed Raggi’s “Rasputin” and is reportedly under investigation in connection to real-estate deals dating back to 2013, comes just days after the resignation of another city councillor under scrutiny for corruption, and the revelation that police have seized documents from city hall as part of their investigation into the mayor’s hiring practices. Raggi herself has not been accused of wrongdoing. But the successive scandals raise questions about whether she can maintain the support of M5S’s leadership, including founder Beppe Grillo, given the party’s tough anti-corruption rules that have forced other elected officials in the past to step down if there is even a suggestion of impropriety. The unfolding scandal has political implications far beyond Rome. M5S – a Eurosceptic and populist party that has a good chance of winning Italy’s next election – scored a big win this month when it helped defeat a constitutional referendum supported by the centre-left prime minister, Matteo Renzi, forcing his resignation. The momentum M5S gained from that win could be diminished by the chaos that has engulfed Raggi’s administration in Rome, prompting questions about the party’s ability to govern even as it is pushing for Italy’s president to call early elections. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Raffaele Marra is reportedly under investigation in connection to real-estate deals. Photograph: Angelo Carconi/EPA Matteo Orfini, a top official in Renzi’s Democratic party (PD), was quick to link the events in Rome to the party’s leaders – including Grillo – who he said “shared responsibility” for the scandals because they had not heeded warnings that Raggi was “recycling” allegedly dubious officials from previous governments and putting them in her administration. In the meantime, however, the PD has had its own problems. Marra’s arrest came as the PD mayor of Milan, Giuseppe Sala, announced he would suspend himself from office – at least temporarily – after he learned through media reports that his role as the commissioner of the Milan Expo in 2015 was under investigation. While the Sala news was significant, it was overshadowed by the implosion of Raggi’s administration, in part because she holds the office with the highest profile in her party. “The challenge for the Five Star Movement is to show they are a credible alternative and Rome is of course their biggest test. Even with all the caveats – these are investigations for now – all these events taken together give the impression of lack of experience and amateurism, the inability to pick the right people to help you as part of your cabinet,” said Vincenzo Scarpetta, a senior policy analyst at the thinktank Open Europe. Raggi’s decision to bring Marra into her administration has been a source of controversy for months. Marra previously worked for the former rightwing mayor Gianni Alemanno, whose tenure had been the subject of numerous corruption investigations. The impact of Marra’s arrest was made worse by the fact that Raggi suffered another defeat just days ago, when Paola Muraro, who was supposed to head the city’s rubbish collection, resigned after she was notified that she was under investigation for earlier work she did as a consultant for Rome’s rubbish collection company. Raggi had defended her controversial appointment of Muraro for months, saying questions about Muraro’s previous work were merely political smears intended to weaken her. She said in a press statement that she had probably made a mistake in trusting Marra, saying she had faith in him as a former city official. She expressed faith in the judiciary and said Marra would immediately be replaced. “I’m sorry for Romans and for Beppe Grillo, who had shown some concern (about him),” she said. The M5S blog, its main vehicle to communicate with followers, defended the mayor on Thursday night. “The Five Star Movement is under attack and soon ... it will get much worse,” the blog said. It attacked as “false” reports that offices in city hall had been ransacked by police as part of their search for documents. Instead, the post said, there was a “mere acquisition” of documents by police that were willingly made available to authorities by the mayor’s office without necessitating a formal request. “The M5S is working to clean up the rubble left by the Democratic party and other parties, supported by the media,” it concluded. “Day by day we strive to unmask all the lies told to citizens. Give us a hand.”",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"UK Ebola patient’s return exposes Public Health England’s inconsistencies", "content": "Public Health England, the government agency charged with protecting the nation’s health, is caught between a rock and a hard place over Ebola. Its experts believe there is little risk to the general public from anybody travelling to the UK while incubating the virus, but political pressure and tabloid excitability has forced them to take a tougher line than they consider strictly necessary. And now that a nurse with the virus has indeed arrived in the UK, as has often been predicted, the inconsistencies of the PHE position are exposed. When it first became clear that the Ebola outbreak would probably touch UK and US shores, health experts were not in favour of restrictions at the borders, let alone quarantine for people returning from west Africa. There is a clear rational argument for not imposing either: nobody who has the Ebola virus is infectious until they develop a fever. Even at that point, when their temperature has gone above the nominal ceiling that has been imposed of 37.5C (originally PHE said 38C), they can only transmit the virus to other people through their bodily fluids. In practice, that means vomit, blood or diarrhoea. Sweat and tears appear to contain little virus in the early stages. So there is very little in the way of stranger danger. If you sat beside somebody with the virus whose temperature was beginning to rise, you would be unlikely to catch it. It is the relatives who welcome them home, and hold them and nurse them as they become really sick who are at high risk. Airport checks are a rough and ready business. They will not pick up people who have the virus – they only have a hope of detecting that first early symptom of infection, the fever. Pauline Cafferkey, the nurse now being treated at the Royal Free hospital, will have had her temperature checked several times at Freetown airport as she left Sierra Leone and again in Casablanca when changing planes. I did the same trip back and joined the queue for Casablanca’s heat detector scanner. Quite what would have happened to anybody whose temperature was too high at that point is anyone’s guess – hospital in Morocco or a plane back to Sierra Leone? Finally, Cafferkey and the other NHS volunteers returning with her were questioned and had their temperature taken by Public Health England nurses at Heathrow. There, too, she passed the test. But every returnee knows to take their own temperature twice a day for the next 21 days after leaving west Africa. She sounded the alarm herself as soon as she saw it rise. PHE would have been happy without airport screening in the UK. It certainly did not want the sort of home quarantining for three weeks that some places have imposed in the USA – and resisted political pressure on that one. But it has toughened its line in the past few weeks on returning health workers. There are now more restrictions on the work they can do and where they can go in the 21 days after they get back. One nurse I met in Liberia said her family, from the Isle of Man, would have to come to her for Christmas because she would not be permitted to travel to them. The position now owes little to logic. If returnees are a danger to anyone, they should not be able freely to travel or even, presumably, queue at the supermarket or watch a film or a play. Nobody is suggesting that. But as Dr Martin Deahl, who sat beside Cafferkey on the plane home, said, if that is so, then why are they allowed to take the underground from Heathrow to the other side of London or, indeed, a plane to Glasgow? The truth is that the restrictions do not make sense. The best defence against Ebola is education and information. The person who will have prevented anyone else being infected with the virus on Cafferkey’s return is actually Cafferkey herself – who immediately alerted the authorities the moment she began to be any sort of risk.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Tony Blair doubts Ed Miliband can win 2015 general election", "content": "Tony Blair has cast doubt on the likelihood of Labour leader Ed Miliband winning the next election, saying it could well be a contest that repeats previous Conservative victories against a traditional leftwing party. The former Labour prime minister has until now disputed reports that he does not believe Miliband can win in May. However, he told the Economist that the result might well be an election “in which a traditional leftwing party competes with a traditional rightwing party, with the traditional result”. Asked if he meant a Tory win, Blair said: “Yes, that is what happens.” The former PM also said he saw no evidence of a shift to the left in public thinking after the financial crisis – a move that Miliband thinks has occurred. “I am still very much New Labour and Ed would not describe himself in that way, so there is obviously a difference there,” he added. “I am convinced the Labour Party succeeds best when it is in the centre ground.” In October Blair’s office insisted the former prime minister believes Miliband will win the next general election, following a report he has told friends that Labour is not ready to beat the Conservatives in May. The report in the Daily Telegraph said Blair had told long-standing political allies that David Cameron would remain in power next year because Labour has not persuaded Britain it is ready to govern. Miliband continues to enjoy a lead in almost every opinion poll, with most suggesting Labour will at least be the largest party after next year’s election. However, some senior Labour figures are worried about Miliband’s low personal popularity ratings and the fact he is trailing behind Cameron in terms of confidence in him running the economy. The comments come as Labour tried to play down a revolt among staff over its general secretary’s backing for a political consultancy to coach the party’s general election candidates. Unionised staff at Labour’s Brewer’s Green headquarters have fired off a four-page letter of complaint to Iain McNicol, the party’s general secretary, about his involvement in Labour People – a new company set up by a 29-year-old brand consultant, Dennis Marcus. The party officials have accused McNicol of failing to consult them about the role of the consultancy, whose aims they believe overlap with their job descriptions. Asked about the letter, which demands answers to 13 questions about McNicol’s involvement in Labour People, party spokesmen would only say that they do not comment on internal matters. Staff appear to have gone to some lengths to track down the involvement of McNicol in the consultancy, saying they discovered a document on an office printer that discussed potential “sensitivities” within the party about the work of Labour People. The letter, first uncovered by the Times, raises concerns that while Labour People offers a pro bono service to candidates “at the moment”, it could become a money-making venture. Marcus, who set up the company in October, is a former intern at the Tony Blair Faith Foundation, and has also worked for a poverty project and in corporate communications. He told the Times McNicol stepped down two weeks ago as chairman of the Labour People advisory board. Material from the Labour People consultancy claims to have the backing of Gina Miller, the philanthropist, David Offenbach, a Labour donor, and Stephen Kinnock, the son of former leader Neil Kinnock and a parliamentary candidate.",diasaster:0},

It included “ensur[ing] that Israel receives maximum military, strategic and tactical cooperation from the United States” and a declaration of war on the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement and pro-Palestinian campus activism. Friedman, 57, has worked with Trump for more than 15 years and advised the president-elect on the Middle East during his election campaign. He represented Trump after the umbrella company for his three Atlantic City casinos, Trump Entertainment Resorts, went into bankruptcy in 2009. He said he was looking forward to taking up his post in “the US embassy in Israel’s eternal capital, Jerusalem”, indicating Trump’s determination to overturn years of US policy and move the embassy from Tel Aviv. The change would be a potentially explosive gesture in the Middle East, as the status of Jerusalem is one of the issues in the long-stalled Israeli-Palestinian negotiations. Also controversial is Friedman’s presidency of the American Friends of Bet El Institutions, an organisation that supports a large illegal West Bank settlement just outside Ramallah. His links with Bet El, along with recent revelations that the family charity of Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law, gave money to one of the West Bank’s most hard-line ideological settlements, suggests the settler movement will have an unprecedented number of advocates in the heart of Washington. Announcing the appointment in a statement, Trump said: “[Friedman] has been a long-time friend and trusted adviser to me. His strong relationships in Israel will form the foundation of his diplomatic mission and be a tremendous asset to our country as we strengthen the ties with our allies and strive for peace in the Middle East.” The announcement appears to have caught Israeli analysts by surprise. The Haaretz columnist Chemi Shalev said Friedman made Israel’s rightwing prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, “seem like a leftwing defeatist”. “From where Friedman stands,” he said, “most Israelis, never mind most American Jews, are more or less traitors.” Friedman disagrees with the general international consensus that the settlements are illegal and he opposes a ban on settlement construction on the West Bank and in East Jerusalem. He wrote in the Jerusalem Post during the US election campaign that Israel would feel “no pressure” under a Trump administration. “America and Israel will enjoy unprecedented military and strategic cooperation, and there will be no daylight between the two countries,” he said. In a column for the Israel National News website, he compared the liberal Jewish US lobby group J Street to concentration camp prisoner-guards and described its supporters as “smug advocates of Israel’s destruction delivered from the comfort of their secure American sofas – it’s hard to imagine anyone worse”. He went further at the Saban forum earlier this month, saying J Street’s supporters were “not Jewish, and they’re not pro-Israel”. 'Call me': Donald Trump woos tech leaders at New York meeting Read more The J Street president, Jeremy Ben Ami, said in a statement on Thursday: “J Street is vehemently opposed to the nomination of David Friedman. This nomination is reckless, putting America’s reputation in the region and credibility around the world at risk.” The National Jewish Democratic Council tweeted: “Trump must stand for a strong US-Israel relationship and take it seriously. [There] hasn’t ever been a less experienced pick for US ambassador to Israel.” Lara Friedman, of Americans for Peace Now, tweeted: “I don’t know about the Palestinians, but I know Jews who truly care about Israel’s security, democracy & place in the world are outraged.” Like Trump, Friedman is an admirer of Vladimir Putin, and has portrayed the Russian president as fighting Islamic State in Syria despite little of the Russian war effort being focused on Isis. “Vladimir Putin gets it,” Friedman wrote in November last year. “He may be a ‘thug,’ as he was recently described by Senator [Marco] Rubio, but he knows how to identify a national objective, execute a military plan, and ultimately prevail.”",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"For God’s sake Pope Francis, don’t retire. The world needs you", "content": "Pope Francis is 80 on Saturday – the age at which cardinals must retire from the electoral college, which will choose the next leader of the world’s 1.2bn Roman Catholics. Will Francis also go at 80? In the past, popes ignored the watershed. They went on until they died. But Benedict XVI changed things when he became the first leader of the Catholic church to resign in more than 500 years. Francis has indicated that he might retire too. It is vital, not just for the church but the world, that he does not. The two popes before Francis were conservatives. Between them, John Paul II and his successor, Benedict, set the public tone of Catholicism for more than three decades. In just three years, Francis has gone some way to hauling the church back towards the centre. But the ideological right is increasingly fighting back. Their private criticism of the first pope from the global south is turning to public dissent. Now is not the time for Francis to have innovative thoughts about institutionalising papal retirement by stepping down. Francis is not the liberal the secular media sometimes paint him. He takes the traditional Catholic line on abortion, contraception, gay marriage and women priests. And yet his positions can be more nuanced than the right can tolerate. Gay people have felt welcomed by his famous “who am I to judge?” remark. He has invited transgender people into the Vatican and physically embraced them. He has opened the path to fuller inclusion of divorced and remarried Catholics with the church. He has set up a commission to investigate the possibility of women deacons, which many see as the first step to female priests. And, at the recent 500th anniversary of the Reformation, he acknowledged that Martin Luther had a point about spiritual corruption within the Catholic church. All this – together with his sweeping reforms of Vatican finances, his work to remodel the bureaucracy known as the Curia, and his moves to empower the wider church and rid the papacy of its monarchical status – have gone down badly with traditionalists. Some of the men who became bishops during the previous 35-year conservative ascendancy have reacted with sullen silence, in what one Vatican veteran described as “passive-aggressive non-compliance”. But others have been publicly hostile or disdainful – and some are now openly resisting him. Just a month ago, four ultra-traditionalist cardinals issued a public challenge to the pope. They said that his ruling that, in certain circumstances, remarried Catholics might take communion could require a “formal act of correction” from the College of Cardinals. They published five dubia – doubts – virtually accusing the sitting pope of heresy: something without precedent in recent Catholic history. Those who rely on the internet for their information might be forgiven for supposing a civil war is raging inside the Catholic church. That is certainly what the “culture warriors” in the US – which is where many of the most ideological hardliners are to be found – want the world to believe. They paint a picture of a Catholic majority, loyal to the unchanging traditions and teachings of the church, locked in combat with a progressive pope who is diluting doctrine and capitulating to the moral relativism of contemporary secularism. Such nonsense flies in the teeth of opinion polls, which show that 85% of US Catholics approve of this pope. Talk to Catholics in the pews in the United States and you encounter a less rigid, more generous, more pastoral mood than is evident among some of their bishops. In Europe and the UK, too, the vast majority of Catholics love this pope. The church has always married aspirational ideals with a pragmatic pastoral compassion. Francis enshrined this subterranean pragmatism in official teaching when he issued his document Amoris Laetitia (The Joy of Love) in April, after a two-year synod process. His critics accuse him of being wilfully vague in the document and deliberately avoiding doctrinal clarity; the pope’s response is that people are more important than dogma. Will the Catholic church ever earn women’s forgiveness? | Joanna Moorhead Read more Mercy is the prime gospel value for Francis. It has been the dominant theme of his time as pope. During his Year of Mercy, which ended last month, Francis made that concrete with a series of private visits to vulnerable and marginalised groups. He ended with an encounter – to the discomfit of traditionalists – with men who left the priesthood to marry, and with their wives and children, too.“We have to meet people where they are,” he has said. This pope is playing a long game. He has refused to reply to the four cardinal critics but has indirectly attacked them for rigidity, legalism, psychological inadequacy and generallybehaving like the Pharisees who tried to trap Jesus with trick questions in the gospels. Publicly, he has declared himself unworried by a vociferous minority. “I’m not losing sleep over it,” he told an interviewer recently, adding that he would continue to follow the path of the second Vatican council, which turned the church away from sacramental introspection towards engagement with the wider world – a reform that many conservatives have spent the past four decades trying to undo. Instead, the Pope has been quietly moving to restore a more moderate tone to the church. He has just sacked all the conservatives from the body that governs Catholic worship. He bypassed the three leading rightwing US archbishops who expected red hats when he created 19 new cardinals last month. And the head of the Vatican’s main working court this week declared that the four cardinal critics could be stripped of their red hats. Francis may not go that far but he is steadily filling the College of Cardinals with moderate pastors rather than doctrinal ideologues. For the first time in history, Europeans are outnumbered by the rest of the world in the body that will elect the next pope. Cardinals have been appointed from 11 countries that have never before been represented.Almost half the electors are now from the poor world. But Francis has named only 44 of those electors, compared with 76 created by previous conservative popes. If he wants to secure his legacy he must not retire yet.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Ferry fire: two Albanian seamen killed during Norman Atlantic rescue", "content": "Two Albanian seamen were killed on Tuesday during an operation to secure the stricken Italian ferry Norman Atlantic. The seamen died after the cable between their tugboat and the ferry snapped as they were towing the fire-blackened vessel towards the Albanian port of Vlore. “One man died on the spot when one cable broke after it got stuck in the propeller,” a port authority official in Vlore told Reuters. “The other died on board … when being assisted by a helicopter medical team.” The latest deaths came after it emerged that prosecutors had made the ship’s owner and, more controversially, its captain, suspects in their inquiry into the disaster. The charges they are considering include multiple manslaughter, negligence leading to a shipwreck and negligence leading to bodily harm. Captain Argilio Giacomazzi, who was the last person to abandon the fire-gutted ferry on Monday afternoon, has been hailed by many of his compatriots as a hero. His conduct was in stark contrast to that of the skipper of the Costa Concordia, the cruise liner that was wrecked off the coast of Tuscany in 2012, who abandoned ship long before the evacuation was complete. The Norman Atlantic was on its way from Patras in Greece to Ancona in Italy on Sunday morning when a fire broke out on its car deck. The 26,900-ton roll-on, roll-off ferry was chartered to a Greek line, Anek, but Italian prosecutors have claimed jurisdiction over the inquiry on the grounds that the ship was flying the Italian flag. Passengers have alleged that the alarm was sounded too late and that the crew were ill-prepared for the emergency. It is has also emerged that a malfunction of at least one fire door was among the defects noticed in an inspection of the vessel earlier this month. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Passengers airlifted off burning ferry in the Adriatic Sea. Carlo Vicientini, the ship’s owner, said in a statement on Sunday night that the problem had been “immediately eliminated”. The commander-in-chief of the Italian coastguard, Admiral Nicola Carlone, told a press conference in Rome on Monday that the ship, which was launched only five years ago, was fully seaworthy. Ten people aboard the Norman Atlantic are known to have died in the disaster but confusion continues to surround the number of missing. Anek Lines said there were 475 people aboard the ferry. But according to Italian officials only 427 were rescued. Even assuming that all of the dead are included in the operators’ tally, that leaves 38 people unaccounted for. On Monday evening, Admiral Giovanni Pettorino of the Italian navy said that 80 of those rescued were not on the list of passengers and crew. That would bring the total number of missing to 118. Two of the 49 rescued passengers who came ashore at Bari on Monday were Afghans trying to reach Italy without authorisation.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Traditional skills at risk of dying out, says craft group", "content": "Skills such as weaving, forging and soldering are in danger of being lost as demand for them falls in the digital age, the Heritage Crafts Association has warned. It said some traditional crafts were now “in the hands of an ageing population” and at risk of fading away in the next five years. The group listed nine of Britain’s most endangered professions, including the crafting of traditional wooden beer barrels and the manufacture of denim. It said there was one master cooper and one denim-maker left in the UK, as well as one clog-maker and two scissor-makers. Owen Jones, the last full-time craftsperson of oak swill baskets in Britain, first learned his trade in 1988. “I learned from one of the last swillers, a man called John Barker, who had served his time since his internship in the 1930s in the swill shops in Furness,” he said. “He recognised the skill was becoming extinct and so was keen to pass it on. The oak baskets, which are woven around a hazel rim, are very traditional to the Furness Fells in South Cumbria and have been around since at least the sixteenth century. “I do feel proud to have taken this on and kept it alive” Jones added. “I did feel this was a real responsibility so I have now taught two people, who do it in a small, part-time way, so it’s not quite as endangered as it would have been five years ago. It is still very important.” Pat Reynolds, co-coordinator at the Heritage Crafts Association, said centuries-old crafts would die out unless younger people made a concerted effort to learn them. “We have an incredible range of craft skills in the UK and some of the best craftspeople in the world,” she said. “These skills will only survive if they live in each generation. They provide a link to our roots, and they are part of our shared heritage.” The association has launched a photography competition to celebrate the work of practitioners of traditional British crafts. The winning entries will be announced and displayed during London Craft Week in May. The future is not bleak for all UK craft industries: there has been a boom in craft breweries, with many small breweries experiencing a doubling in sales over the past two years as both national and international as demand has grown for locally and independently made beers.",diasaster:0},

{ "title":"Snap elections will be decisive for Greece’s eurozone future, says Samaras", "content": "Next month’s snap elections in Greece will be decisive for the country’s future in the eurozone, the prime minister, Antonis Samaras, said on Tuesday after requesting parliament’s dissolution. “People don’t want these elections and they aren’t necessary,” the beleaguered leader told the nation’s outgoing head of state Karolos Papoulias. “They are happening because of party self-interest … and this struggle will determine whether Greece stays in Europe.” Signalling market concerns, credit rating agency Fitch said prolonged political uncertainty could “increase the risks to Greece’s creditworthiness”. The country was forced into holding early elections after parliament failed on Monday to endorse Stavros Dimas, the government’s candidate for president. With the debt-burdened country dependent on international rescue funds, officials said the radical left main opposition Syriza party would “pay a heavy price” for triggering the elections after joining forces with the far-right Golden Dawn to block Dimas from becoming president. Late on Monday the IMF said it would suspend aid instalments until after the 25 January poll. “People will punish those who have triggered this unnecessary turmoil, because it is obvious that Syriza has no solution [to economic problems]. It neither says where it will find the money, nor will it find the money,” said government spokeswoman Sophia Voultepsi, referring to the party’s pledge of wide-ranging social benefits if it wins power. On the back of popular discontent over gruelling austerity, the price of €240bn (£188bn) in aid, Syriza has led polls since European elections in May. But the gap has narrowed since Samaras gambled by bringing forward the presidential election. An opinion poll on Tuesday showed a three percentage point lead for Syriza over Samaras’ New Democracy party. This followed the Greek finance minister Gikas Hardouvelis’ warning of economic sanctions by the European Central Bank if the anti-austerity Syriza won. Analysts predicted that Samaras, who has better personal ratings than Syriza’s leader, Alexis Tsipras, could win the elections yet.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Prime minister criticised for appointing Tory peer as lobbying watchdog chair", "content": "David Cameron has been accused of encouraging the revolving door between Westminster and the private sector by appointing a former Conservative minister, who earns up to £800 a day from a political consultancy firm, to chair the government’s lobbying watchdog for a five-year term. The prime minister named Tory peer Angela Browning as chairman of the advisory committee on business appointments (Acoba), which recommends whether ministers, senior civil servants, and top aides can take up private sector jobs on leaving their government posts. The installation of a party insider to such a sensitive role is likely to reignite concerns about the effectiveness of Acoba, which has been criticised by Labour for being toothless when it comes to stopping former ministers taking up lucrative lobbying jobs. Her appointment was announced on the last day before the Christmas recess. Browning has promised to be “absolutely” independent in the role. She was a minister in the Home Office until 2011 and is now paid between £300 and £800 a day for occasional work for a political consultancy firm, Cumberlege Eden. The firm trains people in the health industry on topics such as “how to influence the political agenda” and how to “gain experience of influencing the local MP over a topical health issue”, according to its website. Lady Browning, a former deputy chairman of the Conservative party, will take up the role four months before the general election, after which it is possible a raft of her colleagues will want to take up private sector jobs, and will need approval. A senior Tory source said Browning had been through the usual process for public appointments including applying for an advertised role and having a panel interview, while a spokesman for Acoba stressed that her private sector job was fully declared to the committee, of which she is already a member. Her appointment was also accepted by the House of Commons public administration committee, chaired by Tory backbencher Bernard Jenkin. However, not all members of the committee were happy with the choice, with opponents including Paul Flynn, a Labour MP, and Greg Mulholland, a Liberal Democrat MP. Flynn said the appointment was a sign of Cameron’s failure to overhaul the system that scrutinises lobbying, which the prime minister once warned would be the next big political scandal. “I have known Baroness Browning for a long time. She was a very good backbencher. But she sees nothing wrong with the way the committee currently operates,” Flynn said. “The revolving door is deeply corrupting not just when ministers leave government but when they look for these jobs while still in government. It’s not theoretical, it’s actually happened.” He added: “You’ve got the great and the good who think it’s normal to pick up huge sums for a few days’ work and are actually presiding as judge and jury over what people like themselves do. In no way is it a watchdog. In no way is it a body in the public interest. It is a body to protect their own over-awarded jobs in retirement years. It ... goes to the heart of what is wrong with the political system.” At the public administration committee hearing Browning stressed that she would be neutral, pointing to her work as an electoral commissioner and on the standards committee as an example of where she had to “balance sometimes quite delicate facts and issues in a very non-partisan way”. The appointment is one of several instances in which Cameron has allowed political figures to run independent watchdogs. He was criticised earlier this year for allowing Tony Caplin, a former Tory chief operating officer, to chair the £60bn Public Works Loans Board. Caplin was forced to resign after it emerged he was made bankrupt in 2012. Cameron put Laura Wyld, a PR consultant and former Conservative campaigns officer, in charge of his public appointments unit, a politically impartial role. Browning was a Conservative MP for Tiverton from 1992 until 2010, during which time she was an agriculture minister, sat on the shadow front bench and was a deputy chairman of the party. After being made a peer in 2010, she was made a minister for crime prevention in 2011 before stepping down for health reasons. A former teacher and then management consultant, Browning will receive around £8,000-a-year in public money for the role, which will be two to three days a month of work. Labour has already accused the advisory committee of being “toothless”, even before the appointment of a Tory peer to run it, because the body has never recommended any outright ban on a former minister taking up a private sector job. Ed Miliband’s party has said it will shake up Acoba and give it proper powers to curb lobbying.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Clinton accuses Putin of acting on 'personal beef' in directing email hack", "content": "Hillary Clinton has accused the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, of personally directing a cyberattack against her as revenge for a five-year-old slight. US intelligence agencies blame Russian hackers for targeting the Democratic National Committee and Clinton campaign chairman, John Podesta. The emails were published by WikiLeaks and widely reported by media during the US presidential election. The CIA has reportedly concluded that the Russians were trying to swing the election for Donald Trump. On Friday afternoon the Washington Post reported that the FBI now agreed with this assessment, citing a message to staff from CIA director John Brennan reported to them by unnamed officials. “Earlier this week, I met separately with FBI [director] James Comey and DNI [director of national intelligence] Jim Clapper, and there is strong consensus among us on the scope, nature, and intent of Russian interference in our presidential election,” the paper quoted Brennan as saying. White House says Vladimir Putin had direct role in hacking US election Read more The hacking sprang from Putin’s “personal beef” against her, Clinton told donors in Manhattan on Thursday, according to a report in the New York Times. She cited criticism she made as secretary of state that Russia’s 2011 parliamentary elections were rigged as the motive. “Putin publicly blamed me for the outpouring of outrage by his own people, and that is the direct line between what he said back then and what he did in this election,” Clinton was quoted as saying. Podesta and other aides have criticised the media for underplaying Russian involvement. Addressing donors who poured millions into her campaign and are still reeling from the outcome, Clinton said: “Make no mistake, as the press is finally catching up to the facts, which we desperately tried to present to them during the last months of the campaign. “This is not just an attack on me and my campaign, although that may have added fuel to it. This is an attack against our country. We are well beyond normal political concerns here. This is about the integrity of our democracy and the security of our nation.” According to the New York Times report, Clinton said her stunning defeat by Donald Trump could be explained by two “unprecedented” events: Putin’s effort to “undermine our democracy” and the ill-timed release of a letter by James Comey, director of the FBI, which said fresh emails had come to light in its investigation into her private server. “Swing-state voters made their decisions in the final days breaking against me because of the FBI letter from Director Comey,” said the Democrat, who won the popular vote by 2.8m votes but effectively lost the electoral college by 77,000 ballots in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. US elections 2016 results: track who won, county by county Read more In an interview with National Public Radio on Friday, Barack Obama warned that the US would retaliate for the Russian cyber-attacks during the presidential election. Facebook Twitter Pinterest US will retaliate against Russia over election hacking, vows Barack Obama – audio The US president said he was waiting for a final report he has ordered into a range of Russian hacking attacks, but promised there would be a response. “I think there is no doubt that when any foreign government tries to impact the integrity of our elections … we need to take action,” Obama said. “And we will – at a time and place of our own choosing. “Some of it may be explicit and publicised; some of it may not be.” The CIA has judged that the Russian cyber-attacks, including the hacking of emails from the Democratic National Committee, were intended to influence the election in Trump’s favour, according to reports. Senators from both parties have called for a congressional inquiry, while Trump himself has rejected the reports and his office has derided the CIA. Trump weighed in on Twitter to ask if it was the “same cyberattack where it was revealed that head of the DNC illegally gave Hillary the questions to the debate?” One of the hacked emails, from the interim DNC head, Donna Brazile, said that a woman from Flint, Michigan, would ask at a primary debate with Bernie Sanders what Clinton would do as president to help people in the town suffering from a lead-contaminated water supply. He earlier tweeted: “If Russia, or some other entity, was hacking, why did the White House wait so long to act? Why did they only complain after Hillary lost?” In fact, the intelligence community had issued its statement on 7 October, a full month before polling day. Obama said he would reserve judgment on Moscow’s intentions pending a final report but he said the impact of the intervention was clear. The debate over motivation, he said “does not in any way, I think, detract from the basic point that everyone during the election perceived accurately – that in fact what the Russian hack had done was create more problems for the Clinton campaign than it had for the Trump campaign”. He added: “There’s no doubt that it contributed to an atmosphere in which the only focus for weeks at a time, months at a time were Hillary’s emails, the Clinton Foundation, political gossip surrounding the DNC.” The president did not attempt to gauge the full impact of the intervention, but insisted it had had an effect. “Elections can always turn out differently,” he said. “You never know which factors are going to make a difference. But I have no doubt that it had some impact, just based on the coverage.” In the NPR interview, Obama expressed incredulity at Republican party support for Trump’s foreign policy positions, which have been uniformly supportive of Putin. “This is somebody, the former head of the KGB, who is responsible for crushing democracy in Russia, muzzling the press, throwing political dissidents in jail, countering American efforts to expand freedom at every turn; is currently making decisions that’s leading to a slaughter in Syria,” the outgoing president said. “And a big chunk of the Republican party, which prided itself during the Reagan era and for decades that followed as being the bulwark against Russian influence, now suddenly is embracing him.”",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"UK model agencies found guilty of price-fixing", "content": "A group of British modelling agencies that represent names including Yasmin Le Bon, Sophie Dahl and Stella Tennant have been fined £1.5m for colluding to fix prices charged to retailers, fashion brands and other customers. The UK competition regulator has fined FM Models, Models 1, Premier, Storm and Viva, along with industry trade body the Association of Model Agents (AMA), for price-fixing modelling services for at least two years from March 2013. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) found that the agencies and their association “systematically exchanged information and discussed prices”, in some cases agreeing to fix minimum prices or agree a common approach to pricing. The price collusion affected customers including high street chains, online fashion retailers and consumer goods brands that use models to front their products and appear in ad campaigns. The regulator’s investigation looked into pricing practices across a broad spectrum of modelling assignments, from fashion magazine shoots offering models fees of a few hundred pounds to ad campaigns offering more than £10,000. The CMA said that the collusion and price fixing did not extend to the services of so-called “top models”. The fine and ruling is hugely damaging to the reputation of the modelling agencies and their industry. Premier represented Naomi Campbell for 17 years, while Storm discovered Kate Moss and Cara Delevingne, although all three are now with other agencies. Models 1 represents Sophie Dahl and Yasmin Le Bon, while Viva’s models include Stella Tennant and Natalia Vodianova. The two biggest fines were charged to Storm (£491,000) and Models One (£394,000). FM Models, which has been given a £251,00 fine, shut down earlier this year. Models 1, Premier and Storm said in a joint statement that they intended to appeal against the ruling. “The CMA’s findings are wholly mistaken,” the agencies said. The agencies said the CMA has failed to understand the role of the modelling agency, which is in part to protect the interests of models. They said their actions were not designed to force up or fix prices but to “protect the interests of models and also ensure a sustainable market which benefits customers, the economy and society”. “We reached our decision to appeal the CMA’s findings without hesitation,” said John Horner, the managing director of Models 1. “The CMA is penalising modelling agencies for seeking to maintain professional standards within the industry whilst also protecting the interests of young and vulnerable people.” Le Bon credited the AMA with “nurturing and protecting” her at the beginning of her career and said it “taught [me] how to become the model I am today”. “Had it not been for the knowledge, experience and professionalism of the agency I would not have sustained a career in the industry,” she said. “It takes time and commitment to build a career and the AMA, with its agents, have always sought to protect young models from exploitation, but also from clients who are under pressure to pay increasingly low fees.” Storm model Hannah Cassidy said the AMA’s guidance had been “essential because the pressure and dangers of exploitation are real”. “I have benefited from their experience in negotiating rates, working conditions, terms and image use,” she said. “Agents promote but also protect models from unfair contract and exclusivity terms which could harm their careers. They also make sure I get paid on time.” Viva, which was fined £245,000, also strenuously denies wrongdoing. “Viva strongly denies it agreed to fix minimum prices or that it agreed a common approach to pricing,” said a spokeswoman for the agency. “To date, the CMA has produced no evidence to demonstrate that the conduct which is the subject of the CMA’s Decision had any effect on the rates models represented by Viva received for assignments; this is because it did not have any such effect.” The CMA said that the AMA and the agencies also sought to influence other members of the industry body by regularly issuing email circulars, known as AMA Alerts, urging them to resist the prices offered by customers on the grounds they were too low. “When businesses collude rather than compete the ultimate losers are customers,” said John Wotton, the chair of the Case Decision Group at the CMA, which made the decision. “This type of behaviour harms the economy and deprives businesses and consumers of the benefits of competition.”",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Syria proves force is sometimes necessary", "content": "The headline above Owen Jones’s piece (Opinion, 15 December) asserts that “bombing wouldn’t have saved Aleppo”, but the article contains absolutely no evidence or argument to support this assertion. Syrian democratic forces would argue with considerable good cause that on the contrary, the bombing of Assad’s airbases in 2013 would have had a major impact, given their uprising a chance of success, and prevented the development of the vacuum into which Putin and Islamic State subsequently moved. Like Jones, I have supported democratic socialism as a universal aim all my life; unlike him and apparently many others of his generation, I firmly believe that we must sometimes be prepared to use military force to fight for democracy, whether it be in Spain in 1936, or in Europe in 1939, and to support it when necessary in other places like the Americas in more recent decades. Perhaps Jones could now tell us whether there are any circumstances in which he would support the use of force, or whether he is happy to always appease the crushing of democracy by the force of ruthless dictators like Assad and Putin. Steve Smart Malvern, Worcestershire • While it is easier to bomb state targets than it is to bomb militias embedded within civilian populations, the UK’s past bombardments of Iraq and Libya have been massively destructive. There is no reason to imagine that the bombardment of the Syrian state that George Osborne wanted (Osborne: MPs must share blame for Syria crisis, 14 December) would have been any different from the wilful destruction of those two states and their civilian infrastructure. Nor do we even need to look at Libya or Yemen to observe British hypocrisy: Britain has actively blocked any negotiation or initiative on Syria that did not adhere to its precondition of regime change. It has been an active participant in the war for regime change, at the same time as its politicians and media have pretended that it is a concerned bystander. Sabre-rattling by British media and politicians continues to be part of the problem rather than the solution for Syria.

Generalising about the personal experiences of 65 million individuals is wildly ambitious, but it has never put a newspaper columnist off before, so here goes … Your wages went up Average pay rose from £463 to £475 a week (£24,076 to £24,700 a year) excluding bonuses, according to the Office for National Statistics. That’s an extra 2.5% a year, although for the lowest paid the story was better, with a 7.5% rise as the National Living Wage of £7.20 was introduced in April for the over-25s, replacing the previous figure of £6.70. But if you generally don’t feel any better off, you’re right – the governor of the Bank of England admitted we are in the midst of a “lost decade” of wage growth, unknown for more than a century. Prices stayed flat(ish) Inflation, as measured by the CPI, was 1.2% in the year to November. So workers who enjoyed the average 2.5% wage rise should be 1.3% better off this Christmas. Not a lot, but better than recent years when inflation outstripped any miserable rise in pay. What’s really helped has been falling grocery prices – down 1.7% over the year, according to the British Retail Consortium, although Toblerone lovers suffered as it got gappier, and Marmite became the poster child of post-Brexit price increases. Petrol prices are also firmly on the up. This time last year we were writing about a festive boost as prices headed below £1 a litre, but now the average has shot up to £1.15. What’s more, that dusty old index, the RPI – the one the government prefers not to use because it always seems higher than CPI – is up 2.2% over the year so, on that basis, it nearly cancels out the average rise in wages. House prices and rents started to cool Longed-for falls in house prices have only materialised at the top end of the London market, but there are welcome signs that the steam is finally coming out of Britain’s over-inflated market. The average UK house price was £217,000 in October 2016, the last date the ONS has data for. Sadly, this is £14,000 higher than in October 2015, but month-on-month was unchanged. Prices in the City of London fell fastest, down 8.8% over the year. Most commentators are forecasting prices flat-lining in the UK next year. Rental indices are notoriously unreliable, but there’s good news there, too. Average rents in the UK rose to £898 in November, up 3.1% over the year, but they fell in October. In London they were up just 1.6% over the year, with mounting evidence that they have been falling since the referendum result. And in a surprise, but hugely welcome, move announced in the autumn statement, letting fees to tenants are to be banned, although we don’t know quite when. Investment Isas had a boom year Stock markets soared in the wake of the Brexit result and the Trump victory, with the FTSE 100 index currently running 16% up over the year and the S&P 500 on Wall Street hitting a record high. Workers with defined contribution pension schemes will have seen the value of their savings increase, although pegged back by bond holdings where gains have been near invisible over the year, and negative recently. Much of the rise in UK share prices is down to the fall in sterling, but is welcome nonetheless. But holidaymakers suffered By mid-August the pound had fallen to just €1.15, down nearly a fifth on the summer before, and some bureaux de change were giving less than €1 for £1. Sterling has crawled back a bit, but foreign holidays look set to remain pricey. What about 2017? Earnings growth is faltering and prices rising. Worse, the axe falls on tax credits in April, hitting the poorest families hardest. Enjoy Christmas while it lasts.",diasaster:0},

A study from University College London, tracking 9,000 people over four years, has found that enjoying life and having a positive outlook in your 50s is linked to longevity. We asked people over 50 how they keep their happiness levels up. Deb (55), works for the NHS; Sally (51), leisure centre cook; Julie (55), works for Sue Ryder, all from Norfolk Deb: Doing things separately away from family is good. Having lots of grown-up girly time. Now our children are grown up, it’s easier to fit in socialising. We get together at the weekends and sleep over. Our families benefit because we’re happy – we have free time away from them and we go home relaxed. It’s good to get away from normal day-to-day routine, just being ourselves. I forget how old I am. I definitely have more fun now than I did when I was 20 or 30. My life seems fuller, a better quality of life. Sometimes it is hard to keep in touch with friends. But you have to make time, and take the time out. Sally: I love my allotment, which I’ve had for about five years. It’s fresh air, and I love the view. It’s quiet and peaceful – it’s “my time”. Friends and family are important. We have a friend who has MS and it makes us realise what we can do and she can’t anymore. Julie: Days meeting up with friends make me happy. We’ve had the most wonderful time, reliving our teenage years! We went to see the Bay City Rollers, our 1970s heroes – we’ve seen them three times. Such good fun. It takes us back. I have more fun now. Back then you worried about how you looked, but now you’re just relaxed. Stephen Waller (63), airline manager, and Loraine (60), retired, both from Crawley Stephen: I’ve just taken six months unpaid leave to go out and start trying to enjoy things. It’s like a pre-retirement, to get used to it. And to spend more time as a couple, doing things we enjoy. We took the whole family – our three children, their partners and our grandchild – on holiday to Florida. We spent a week in Disneyland and a week on the coast. And now we’re planning our next holiday in Malaysia. Loraine: My family is key to my happiness. My granddaughter is just so gorgeous. I used to look after her for one day a week because everyone was at work. I haven’t changed that much now I’m older. I don’t go out to discos now, but I do still like to dance. I’m looking forward to Steve retiring, as I’ve been home alone for three years. Brij Chagga (53), bid writer in the health sector, from Sheffield I’ve got four kids, who I brought up myself, and five grandchildren. They’re my joy. For fun, I love travelling, and I’ve been to amazing places. I was really happy when I walked the Great Wall of China. London’s tough. It’s a hard city to live in. My balance is going back to Sheffield and seeing my kids – then I’m happy. And no, I’m not worried about smoking. You’re going to die from something, right? Jagit Singh Srai (52), programme director, north London I stay happy playing cricket, watching cricket, or playing football. I think friendly competition gives me happiness. The same things that got me going in my youth keep me going now: achievement in sport, but also in work. In work it’s winning research grants and consultant contracts, and publishing a good paper that’s well read gives me a kick. I think if you follow what you’re good at and what you enjoy doing, and make that your career, then you’re having fun and getting paid for it. Paddy (50), bookseller, from Devon but lives in London As I’ve got older, I’ve learned that mood has much more to do with the machine of your body rather than how you think. If you get the sun on your skin, talk to another human being, use your body and wear it out a bit each day, eat good food and sleep, I think it’s impossible to feel depressed. I live on a boat and so I spend a lot of my life sitting outside. And because I run a bookshop from it, I spend a lot of my time talking to other people. Most of my socialising and having fun when I was younger was a way to meet girls. When your testosterone levels calm a little bit, it’s like like the sun falls and all the stars become visible. Softer things like live music and reading books seem to be immensely pleasing things. The most fun I have is with the guy I run the bookshop with. Having a creative thing to do with someone else is another secret of happiness, because there’s always someone to motivate you when you’re feeling flat.",diasaster:0},

The Unite union said about half the 135 warehouse workers were ready to walk out in protest against new contracts which would require them to work until 11pm and remove extra payment for unsocial hours. It said workers had been told they must sign up to the new deal by 30 January or face the sack. “Barbour’s sign or be sacked ultimatum is bullying and anti-family. Many of the workers struggling to get by on less than the living wage are the sole breadwinner and have family or caring responsibilities,” said Unite’s regional officer Fazia Hussain-Brown. The union has accused the wax-jacket maker of putting full-time workers on similar terms to temporary staff. The walkout, which is scheduled to start on 5 January, follows a week-long stoppage before Christmas. Unite said it still hoped to reach a negotiated settlement. Barbour was not available for comment but has previously said it was offering a “substantial pay increase” for the move to new shift patterns, which were necessary to satisfy customer demand. This year the dog-walkers’ favourite outfitter this year celebrated 50 years since the actor Steve McQueen wore a Barbour biking jacket as part of the US team in the 1964 International Six Day Trials.

The morning’s pearlescent sky is enhanced by a section of rainbow as a shaft of early sunlight momentarily illuminates the stack on the summit of distant Kit Hill. Here, in this exposed orchard of local varieties, young trees have been regularly pruned to grow on tall trunks and form branches that will withstand the wind and eventually spread to meet across the broad avenues. Unwanted shoots below the grafts were cut out a year ago. Now, in the mildness of midwinter, orange leaves still cling to graceful branches and the recently mown grass is dotted with molehills of soft brown earth. For today’s celebrations, the breadfruit has been chosen, singled out from the 300 apple trees planted in 2007‑08, bound with ribbons, hung with slices of toast and a flutter of red and green tatters. Soon, the sound of drums, whistles, melodeon and brass announces the approach of the procession as it wends through the chapel courtyard, past the flowers of “Cornish Snow” camellia and fragrant chimonanthus, and along paths between clipped yew hedges to the adjoining, older orchard of lichen-covered trees with swags of mistletoe. The orchardist is out in front carrying a jug of cider. His role of satyr, with horns on head and furry trousers, is reminiscent of the faun depicted in the bacchanal tapestry decorating a wall of the punch room within the old house.

{ "title":"John Shember obituary", "content": "Our friend John Shember, who has died aged 68 of leukaemia, joined the probation service in 1969 in Birmingham, where the three of us met. This was a time when alternatives to custody were being actively developed, and belief in welfare and rehabilitation approaches was strong. Birmingham was undergoing profound structural and cultural changes that gradually extended to its deprived inner-city areas, where our challenging “patches” were. John championed the approach to offending that saw lawbreakers as human beings capable of change, given suitable challenge, help and encouragement. He disagreed with the primacy of the “prison works” ideology or “one size fits all” programmes. John, a free thinker, was strongly committed to research and improving the quality of information available to the service. He went on to work in teams in Scotland and Cambridgeshire, then West Yorkshire, and finally in Warwickshire, where he was appointed as the senior probation officer for Rugby in 1982. As philosophies changed, John left this senior role and returned as a main grade officer, working again in Cambridge, where he got to know Araucaria (The Rev John Graham), his favourite Guardian crossword compiler. Even after he became ill, he stayed up to date on policy and practice. He was distressed at the attempts by government to exploit the service, to split it up, sell it off to private bidders, and to make it subject to payment by results, a process the writer Alan Bennett recently described as “beyond satire”. John was born in Oxford, the middle child of Hilde and Albert Shember, who had fled Vienna in 1939. His father was a skilled mechanic and the family lived in north Oxford, where John and his sisters had a secure and idyllic childhood. John attended the City of Oxford boys’ high school, then took an external London University degree in sociology before joining the Birmingham Probation Service as a direct entrant. He later studied for an MA in applied social work. John stayed true all his life to the ideals that raised him. He spoke of his wish to be of service to the country that had sheltered his parents on the brink of war, then generously educated him and his sisters. He saw public service as an honourable way forward and he set the highest standards for himself and those with whom he worked. He is survived by his wife, Bevelie, whom he married in 1979, their children, Griff, Denzil and Eleanor, and his grandchildren, Tom, Alex, Edith and Mabel.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Luise Rainer obituary", "content": "There are very few actors whose culture and friendships ranged so widely, and who knew so many of the great names of the 20th century, as Luise Rainer, who has died aged 104. She was married for three tempestuous years to the radical American playwright Clifford Odets; she was a key member of Max Reinhardt’s theatre company; she was the lover of the German expressionist playwright Ernst Toller; Bertolt Brecht wrote The Caucasian Chalk Circle for her. She is frequently mentioned in the diaries of the writer Anaïs Nin, who was fascinated by her; she was an intimate of Erich Maria Remarque and Albert Einstein; Federico Fellini begged her to be in La Dolce Vita; and George Gershwin gave her a first edition of the score of Porgy and Bess, with a fulsome dedication to her from the composer. In addition, Rainer was the first movie star to win a best actress Oscar in successive years, the first for The Great Ziegfeld (1936) and the second for The Good Earth (1937). And yet, she lived the latter part of her life in comparative obscurity in London, under the name Mrs Knittel. Rainer was born in Düsseldorf, Germany, of well-to-do parents: Heinz Rainer, a German-American businessman, and his wife Emmy (nee Königsberger), a pianist from an upper-class German-Jewish family. Luise, who had dark, expressive eyes in a mobile, wistful face topped by a mass of shiny black hair, was her father’s Augapfel, the apple of his eye. However, she also experienced what she described as his “tyrannical possessiveness”. Feeling lost and out of place in an “average bourgeois surrounding”, she sought solace in the arts: “I was always very rebellious. I felt constricted. My rebellion was against the superficial. My wealthy parents were both immensely musical and cultured, but my father wanted me to marry and have children.” At 16, she made up her mind to go on the stage. “I became an actress only because I had quickly to find some vent for the emotion that inside of me went around and around, never stopping. I would have been happy instead of turning to the stage, to write, to paint, to dance, or, like my mother, to play the piano beautifully.” Behind closed doors, she studied the part of Lulu in Pandora’s Box by Frank Wedekind. After she auditioned at the theatre in Düsseldorf, no one could believe that she had had no previous training. “I could feel the warmth and the love coming to me from the audience and yet I could remain at a protective distance. It was what I needed.” Her parents refused to see her act, and were horrified when she took the leading role in Wedekind’s then-shocking Spring Awakening. Thereafter she appeared in a number of productions, many with Reinhardt’s company, including Pirandello’s Six Characters in Search of an Author, for which she was praised personally by the playwright. A newspaper dubbed her “the wunderkind of drama”. At the time, Toller was in love with her. “He was nothing to me but a man. I was in my teens, and his fame didn’t mean anything to me. But I had no room for him in my life because there were so many other men in love with me at the time.” An MGM talent scout saw Rainer performing in a Viennese production of An American Tragedy in 1934, and she was immediately signed to a seven-year contract as the studio’s secret weapon to keep Greta Garbo in line. So, in 1935, in her late teens, speaking fluent French and German, but little English, Rainer arrived in Hollywood. Her first film for the studio, the spy drama Escapade (1935), in which she replaced Myrna Loy as a Viennese girl opposite William Powell, made her a star. Her new-found status triggered her first clash with the studio boss Louis B Mayer. He wanted to loan her to 20th Century-Fox to co-star with Ronald Colman in The Man Who Broke the Bank at Monte Carlo. Rainer talked him into giving her a much smaller role in the new Powell picture. “There’s this little scene I think I can do something with,” she told him. This “little scene” – which Mayer ordered out after the first previews but later restored – was the short, poignant telephone scene from The Great Ziegfeld. “I wrote the scene myself,” Rainer stated, “though I stole it from Cocteau’s La Voix Humaine.” As Anna Held, she telephones her ex-husband Florenz Ziegfeld to congratulate him on his marriage. It was enough to sway the voters of the Academy and it also established Rainer as an expert exponent of the laughter-through-tears school of acting. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Luise Rainer’s famous telephone scene in The Great Ziegfeld, 1936 The following year, Rainer made an exceptional jump to the role of the downtrodden Chinese peasant woman O-Lan in The Good Earth, based on Pearl Buck’s Pulitzer prizewinning novel. She works silently in the fields with her husband, bears his children, begs for food during the famine, and dies quietly years later when the family has achieved some prosperity. When it was shown to the Chinese government, Madame Chiang Kai-shek reportedly could not believe Rainer was not herself Chinese, and Buck later wrote: “I was much moved by the incredibly perfect performance of Luise Rainer … marvelling at the miracle of her understanding.” But so convinced was Rainer that she had no chance of winning the coveted Oscar for the second year running that on the night of the ceremony she stayed at home in her pyjamas. At 8.35pm, the names of the winners were given to the press, and a member of the Academy telephoned her to tell her she had won. She had to change quickly into evening dress and dash across town with Odets, whom she had married the previous year, to receive her second statuette. That night, she recalled, she and Odets were having a terrific row. She was in tears by the time they got to the Biltmore hotel, and they had to walk around the building five times before she had calmed down sufficiently to go in and accept the award. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Luise Rainer in The Good Earth, 1937 Rainer never made big money in Hollywood. She had opportunities to increase her salary, but was disinclined to accept the method of negotiation offered by Mayer. The mogul said to her: “Why don’t you sit on my lap when we’re discussing your contract, the way the other girls do?” The fiery Rainer told him to throw her contract in the bin. “We made you and we’re going to kill your career,” Mayer roared. She replied: “Mr Mayer, I was already a star on the stage before I came here. Besides, God made me, not you!” Thereafter her films were mediocre, except for The Great Waltz (1938), though her part as Johann Strauss’s wife was considerably trimmed. A nonconformist, Rainer walked around Hollywood in slacks, wearing no make-up, her hair in disarray at the height of 1930s glamour. She also decided to expend her energies elsewhere than on her film career. She helped refugee children from Spain and later, with the US first lady Eleanor Roosevelt, assisted European victims of Nazi Germany. When her disastrous marriage to Odets ended in divorce in 1940, she was living in New York. There she became friendly with Nin, famous for her erotica and her passionate affair with the writer Henry Miller. “My strongest impression when I met her [Rainer] was that you were twins of a sort,” Miller wrote to Nin. “Neither of you belong in this world.” After Nin attended a play in which Rainer was performing, she wrote long descriptions of the actor in her diary. Rainer becomes a “flame” when she performs, says Nin, and certainly “would have been loved by [the French playwright Antonin] Artaud”. Before she left Hollywood, Rainer was told by Brecht that he would like to write a play for her. She suggested an adaptation of Der Kreidekreis (The Chalk Circle) by AH Klabund, based on a Chinese tale, which became The Caucasian Chalk Circle. Later, she and the playwright fell out, and she never performed in it. Soon after, in 1945, Rainer retreated into a long and happy marriage with the publisher Robert Knittel. They travelled extensively and lived for many years in Switzerland. She became a mother, painted and did a play from time to time, notably Maxwell Anderson’s Joan of Lorraine, Ibsen’s The Lady from the Sea, and Chekhov’s The Seagull, in which she played Nina. But for most people, Rainer had disappeared from the public eye. In the late 50s, Rainer and her family moved to Britain. She appeared in some television plays on the BBC, including Stone Faces (1957), a play written for her by JB Priestley. She also played Regina in Lillian Hellman’s The Little Foxes at the Theater in der Josefstadt in Vienna, where she had performed with Reinhardt many years before. In 1973, she took the taxing part of the narrator in Honegger’s oratorio Judith, in French, with the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra, with Jessye Norman singing the soprano part. In 1997, she was enticed into returning to the big screen for the first time in over half a century in The Gambler, based on Dostoevsky. Though the film received lukewarm reviews, Rainer was universally praised. According to Variety: “The pic briefly gets a real lift when the legendary Luise Rainer bursts on the scene in a wonderfully showy part as a gambling-addicted granny.” When I met Rainer at her London flat in 1996, she was an incredibly energetic 86-year-old whom I recognised as the same woman described by Miller as having “wonderful gesture and bearing, such a gracious way of carrying her head, such delicacy”, and the intense and dark eyes that shone from the screen over half a century before. She is survived by her daughter, Francesca. • Luise Rainer, actor, born 12 January 1910; died 30 December 2014",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"EDF to hike electricity prices 8.4% with other providers expected to follow suit", "content": "Householders face steep hikes in electricity bills next year, as EDF Energy said it would raise prices by 8.4% from March, with other “big six” energy providers expected to match the increases. The French-owned energy giant, which in September signed an £18bn deal to build the controversial Hinkley Point nuclear plant, said it would cut gas prices by 5.2% but blamed rising costs for the increase in its electricity tariff. Experts urged customers on standard tariffs to lock into cheap fixed-priced deals while they were still available. The changes mean that dual fuel customers with EDF (taking both electricity and gas) will see their bills rise by 1.2%, to an average of £1,082 a year. Prepayment customers who take both gas and electricity from EDF will still pay 5.1% less after March, at £1,081 a year. Wholesale energy prices have risen by around a third since last spring, and Mark Todd, co-founder of Energyhelpline, said EDF’s rise is likely to be “the first of many”. It is also the first major price rise since the collapse of GB Energy in November. The three-year-old gas and power supplier, which pulled in 160,000 customers with cheaper tariffs, blamed “swift and significant increases in energy prices” for its failure. Fears are now growing that other “challenger” providers could fail, and leave the big six in a stronger position to raise prices. Todd is predicting average rises nearer to 5%. “We urge consumers to take this as proof that price rises are definitely coming and to use it as a catalyst to get off the horrible standard tariffs that make so many cold and penniless, and get onto a nice low-cost fixed rate that makes heating your home affordable,” he added. EDF said that 1.5 million customers would be unaffected because they are locked into fixed-rate deals. It said it would write to those on standard variable tariffs and provide details of its best deals. Beatrice Bigois, managing director of customers at EDF Energy, said: “Many industry commentators have said that prices charged by energy suppliers will rise after the winter. We are being open about the fact our electricity prices will go up after our price freeze. But we also know it is right to pass on to loyal customers the fall in gas costs that energy suppliers have seen over recent months.” But critics said EDF was raising electricity prices when much of its power was already generated from nuclear plants. “EDF is in the unique position of owning all the UK’s nuclear power stations so they don’t actually need to buy any electricity. This means that they have been largely insulated from the turmoil in the wholesale markets that has seen 35% wholesale price rises since March and put GB Energy out of business. These wholesale rises are putting much more pressure on other suppliers to hike rates than EDF,” said Todd. onsumers. EDF is first of the big six to announce that an increase in prices is in the pipeline. British Gas and SSE have both frozen the cost of their standard tariffs over the winter months. Claire Osborne, energy expert at uSwitch, said: “It’s disappointing to see EDF already committing to price rises in March that will make them the most expensive variable tariff of the big six. Increasing the price of an already high energy bill could leave almost 2 million EDF standard variable customers buckling under the pressure, and it’s a bitter pill to swallow even if it is after the winter months – consumers still need to keep the lights on. “With wholesale costs rising, putting further pressure on bills, we have already seen the cheapest deal rise by £126 in the past two months, and the danger is now that the other big six suppliers will follow suit with their own price hikes in the spring.” However Guy Anker, managing editor of Moneysavingexpert, said the price rise was lower than expected given what is happening to wholesale prices. “Nevertheless, no one should see this as good news and it should sound as a loud clarion call to any customer of any energy firm on a standard tariff to urgently check if they can save by locking into a cheap fix, as other firms are likely to follow.” He added: “Urgent is the key word as the price of the cheapest deals has been rising, so the longer you wait the less you’ll save if that trend continues.”",diasaster:0},

Antisemitic incidents comprise about 2% of all hate crime. Why then the concentration on antisemitism and not on Islamophobia, which is far more widespread? The suspicion must be that the real concern is not with antisemitism but with Britain’s support for Israel. New antisemitism definition is justified | Letters Read more Israel claims to be “the only democracy in the Middle East.” Palestinians who live under Israeli occupation are governed by a wholly different set of laws than Jewish settlers. This makes Israel the world’s only apartheid state and thus deserving of strong condemnation and the target of boycott, divestment and sanctions.

Unfortunately this is precisely what the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance’s definition will achieve through perpetuating the stereotype that all Jews support the Israeli state.

Don’t expect your travel insurer to pay up", "content": "A businessman who had everything – including his passport – stolen from a hire car on the last day of a Spanish holiday says he has been left with a £1,300 bill after his holiday insurance refused to pay most of the claim. Paul Whyte and his 17-year-old son had all their bags snatched from the locked boot after stopping for lunch in Benidorm on the way back to the airport in August. Crucially, their passports were in their stolen bags, which meant they had to abandon their Jet2 flights home. Instead, they had to stay an extra night, drive to the British Consulate in Alicante, book last-minute peak-time flights back to Newcastle, and hire a car to get home to Glasgow. His travel insurance was bought from an award-winning company, Holidaysafe, but says he was bemused to discover how little he could claim for. He says the company has used its terms and conditions to refuse to pay for the consequential costs he had assumed would be covered. Whyte, who is semi-retired but still works in property, says: “Everything was locked in the boot of our hire car out of sight, and it all went. The local tourist police told us the airline wouldn’t let us fly without our passports, even though we had checked in with those details. “We had to get back to the villa that we’d already left, extend the car hire, go to the embassy and pay £200 for two emergency travel documents – and re-book expensive flights at a cost of £440 to get us back to the UK.” He says his total losses were in excess of £3,000, but as his Holidaysafe multi-trip policy did not include electronic items, he accepted that his son’s DVD player and other similar items would not be covered. However, he says he was shocked when the claims firm appointed by the insurer, TCF, paid out just £851 for basic items stolen but refused to pay for passports and replacement flights. “I specifically chose this policy as it had been recommended on the Martin Lewis MoneySavingExpert website as being the best value. I have been travelling for over 40 years and always take out insurance. TCF argues that our passport and tickets should be kept in locked trip accommodation, but I had already left my accommodation and was heading back to the airport. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Paul Whyte: ‘I specifically chose this policy as it had been recommended on the MoneySavingExpert website as being the best value.’ “I thought leaving them in a locked car was safer than risking the pickpockets and motorbike thieves that operate in Benidorm,” he says. Emails sent by the claims handler to Whyte state that passports are only covered if taken from a “safety deposit box or your locked holiday trip accommodation”. “We cannot see that a Fiat Panda can be classified as trip accommodation in this instance,” he was told by staff as reason to deny him further payments. Whyte claims that the firm’s stance does not chime with its “customer promise,” prominently set out on its website. This states: “We believe we have to provide the whole package, and that means that not only must the price be competitive, but the cover provided should be extensive, the policy terms and conditions reasonable and easily understood, the customer service should be first class and, most importantly, the claims process must be straightforward and fair, with prompt settlement.” Holidaysafe was recently named as the Consumer Moneyfacts travel insurance provider of the year. TCF told Guardian Money that the underwriter has now decided to add an extra £500 to the payout as a gesture of goodwill. It said: “The items that are contested by Mr Whyte are beyond the terms of his policy. They are regarded as ‘consequential losses’, which the majority of travel policies do not cover. “The underwriters, however, will be trying to address this issue in 2017 by launching a new type of product that will cover these items. This is an industry-wide problem.” A spokesman adds that consumers who buy from comparison sites should be aware that policies will often be categorised as “good value” for a reason. “The cover they get will not be as wide as they might assume due to pressure on premium prices within this competitive market. Travellers such as Mr Whyte should always understand what they are buying before they purchase a policy,” he says. Whyte is just the latest of thousands of holidaymakers who found that their policy didn’t live up to the marketing hype. Last year there were 2,267 complaints to the Financial Ombudsman Service about declined claims. FOS says it generally finds in favour of 48% of consumers following a dispute.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Terrified residents cram on buses for journey into the unknown", "content": "Sima Zain left the only home she had ever known with just a backpack of clothes and a couple of favourite pieces of jewellery, travelling on a bus plastered with pictures of her enemy’s face to an unknown future. The journey was a blur of tears and terror, weeping for the city and friends she was leaving behind, frightened that the evacuation bus with a picture of the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad, stuck to the windscreen would be halted by government troops. “It was really terrifying, really sad,” she said in a phone interview from Idlib province, where Sima, her mother, sister and a few other relatives are staying in rented rooms. “I had lived in Aleppo since I was born – I didn’t leave it even in the revolution or when it was besieged.” What next for Syria, its allies and foes after fall of Aleppo? Read more A university student who came of age during the war, she also worked as a media activist, which would mark her out as a target if the uncertain guarantees given by the Syrian regime to those on the vehicles were broken. “I felt like it’s maybe a trick to capture us, but we had no choice … to them, I am a terrorist.” The evacuation has been difficult and chaotic, with thousands of people streaming through the freezing, shattered streets of rebel-held Aleppo and trying to cram on to one of the few dozen buses provided for up to 50,000 people. Desperate to get out, huge crowds surged around the vehicles. “We had to wait about four hours to get on board,” said 21-year-old Mohanned, who lost contact with his uncle, cousin and father in the crush. “It was so cold, the area was destroyed and the children were all crying. The Red Crescent teams were trying to organise everything, make sure the children and injured got on first, but there were too few buses. Everyone was desperate to get out.” He found his father on one bus but their relatives are still missing. “My uncle and his son are still stuck inside Aleppo, we think; we have not been able to contact them. I don’t know if they managed to get out or are still in the besieged areas.” Communications from Aleppo are at their worst since the start of the war, with phone and internet coverage failing. Batteries are running low, as people trying to flee lose access to generators they usually use to recharge their phones. Fears that the evacuation might be a government trick, which made some wary of boarding the buses, have given way to fears that Assad and his allies may shut down the shaky ceasefire before all can leave. On Friday, the evacuations were halted after rebels linked to al-Qaida broke the ceasefire terms. There were also reports that troops loyal to Assad had stopped buses and killed or detained men on board. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Crowds surround buses that are evacuating people from Aleppo. Photograph: Zouhir Al Shimale/Barcroft Images “Thousands waiting to be evacuated but the sectarian militants prevented us after they took all of our money and told us to go back,” a journalist, Zouhir al-Shimale, tweeted after his bus returned to Aleppo. “After this horrible day, which is the worst catastrophe day of my life … I will not leave without UN observation.” The UN’s children’s agency, Unicef, warned there were still many children, whose lives are in immediate danger, among the crowds hoping for escape. “Hundreds of … vulnerable children, including orphans, remain trapped inside that part of the city,” said Unicef’s director, Anthony Lake. “We are extremely concerned about their fate. If these children are not evacuated urgently, they could die. “Unicef and our partners are on standby to evacuate these children to safety. We implore all parties to the conflict to let us do so safely and immediately.” Those who made it out are still in a war zone in midwinter, weakened by months without proper food or medical care. Few have been able to bring anything other than cash and some clothes with them. At the initial staging point of Khan al-Assal, a few miles outside Aleppo, buses and pickup trucks delivered those lucky enough to have escaped. Those with money took cars and buses to join friends and relatives further afield, but dozens of hungry children milled around asking for food and the injured waited for medical help amid the wail of ambulance sirens. It is an area still targeted by government and Russian bombs, although the attacks are much less intense than the bombing raids on east Aleppo in recent months. Aleppo: a cosmopolitan city built on thousands of years of trade Read more “We’ve gone from hell to the unknown and another hell to follow. They will send us to Idlib and kill us all,” said Idris Rasool, an east Aleppo shopkeeper. “At least I can breathe without the smell of bombs. But it won’t be for long. The regime and their masters, the Iranians, will hunt us down.” Adding to their misery, there was the final humiliation of Assad’s photo pasted on the evacuees’ bus windows. “I wanted to tear this picture apart,” said Zain. “It was an awful feeling to feel a criminal looking at you and not be able to do anything.” All the evacuees hope to return one day but fear that when they lost the battle, they also lost their homes. Assad, they say, will move in supporters to the areas that are still habitable or those he rebuilds. “I left my heart behind; I left the house that I grew up in and the house that I lost my mother in. I spent my childhood there, happy and bad days,” said Abu Ahmad, a 35-year-old aid worker from Saif al-Dawla. “The most difficult part is we left the city defeated and humiliated; I don’t know tomorrow who will move to my house.

{ "title":"NHS computer systems contractor agrees to pay $190m penalty", "content": "A leading contractor on the ill-fated multibillion-pound programme to overhaul NHS computer systems over the last ten years has agreed to pay US regulators a $190m (£120m) penalty to settle allegations it broke stockmarket reporting laws by overstating past profits from UK health service contracts. Computer Sciences Corporation, which is listed on the New York stock exchange, confirmed in a statement to investors there had been accounting errors from 2009 to 2012 relating to assumptions made about progress on its long-term NHS contracts. Revised annual reports are expected to be filed shortly. The settlement with the US Securities & Exchange Commission’s enforcement division comes a year after CSC said it would pay $97.5m to settle a shareholder class-action claim alleging the company and former executives had “fraudulently concealed” from investors the dire performance of the firm’s work for the NHS. Four years ago CSC dismissed reports in the Guardian suggesting its work for the NHS was in crisis, bogged down in delays and budget overruns. The group’s then bosses told Wall Street analysts: “The press speculated wildly and inaccurately on the status of the NHS programme.” As early as 2006, the Guardian had been highlighting concerns about progress. One leaked report, co-authored by CSC, concluded there was “no believable plan” for releases of new software required for its UK health service contracts. But CSC was assuming an increasingly important role in the National Programme for IT, a £12.7bn 10-year project instigated in 2003 with strong support from the then-prime minister Tony Blair. As other contractors dropped out, CSC moved in, taking work over from Accenture and acquiring struggling software contractor iSoft. By 2011, however, CSC’s progress was so poor that the UK Department of Health formally held it in breach of contract. The bad news came as a shock to US investors and the shares fell more than 14%. Since then the DH has officially dismantled the National Programme, though reversing out of associated contracts has proved much harder. Despite its manifest failures, CSC remained in a strong contractual position as a dispute between it and the DH over continuing IT work dragged on for two years. Last year, revised terms were finally agreed, but not before CSC received compensation for relinquishing exclusive rights to provide computer systems to NHS trusts across much of England. The value of CSC’s long-term contracts, once worth £3.1bn, was last year put at £2.2bn by DH officials. Separately, in 2006, the Guardian reported CSC’s rival NHS IT contractor BT had been paid just £1.3m for two years’ work, suggesting it may need to revise the value of its contract. “We are confident we will make money over the length of the London contract,” BT said in response. “There is no need to write off any money.” Three years later it issued related profit warnings, revising progress assumptions on the NHS contracts. The Guardian also spotlighted aggressive accounting and progress delays at iSoft, once a £1bn independent software company listed on the London stock market. The company, which initially secured an injunction against the paper, later admitted that investors had been misled and restated accounts from past years.",diasaster:0},

His emotional honesty helps to explain his appeal, and his ability to inspire people who had switched off from politics. Yes, his politics are rough and inchoate, but he doesn’t claim to have all the answers. Sometimes he can be incoherent. But even that is a refreshing change from the stifling coherence of some of the grand old men of the left, for whom everything must conform to a rigid scheme of loyalties and enmities, and who appear unable to admit mistakes. This obnoxious and dishonest rigidity, often enforced by a cult-like following, is, I believe, one of the reasons why the left often struggles to build support.

{ "title":"Rightwing thinktank pulls funds for Commons groups after disclosure row", "content": "A rightwing thinktank, accused of pushing an anti-Muslim agenda, has pulled funding for two parliamentary groups which focused on homeland and international security after refusing to disclose its donors to the Commons’ standards watchdog. In a ruling earlier this month the parliamentary commissioner for standards upheld complaints against the homeland security and transatlantic and international security parliamentary groups for taking secretariat support from a neoconservative thinktank where Tory chief whip Michael Gove was a former trustee, without getting assurances over its funding. The Henry Jackson Society, a registered charity, had provided an office and staff to organise meetings for the two groups, chaired by Tory MP Bernard Jenkin and Labour MP Gisela Stuart. The arrangement also saw the society’s political director, Davis Lewin, and its events manager, Hanna Nomm, given Commons passes as part of this support. The agreement was terminated after the standards’ commissioner, Kathryn Hudson, said the society should “make available on request a list citing any commercial company which had donated more than £5,000 either as a single sum or cumulatively in the last 12 months”. The society declined and pulled the funding. A spokesman said: “Our donors are entitled to privacy. We do not wish to expose them to unwarranted funding requests by publishing their details.” The thinktank has attracted controversy in recent years – with key staff criticised in the past for allegedly anti-Muslim and anti-immigrant comments. Its associate director, Douglas Murray, complained last year that London had “become a foreign country” because white Britons were a minority in 23 of 33 London boroughs. Murray has also been pictured with Robert Spencer, the far-right US anti-Islam campaigner banned last year from Britain by the Home Office. In 2012 its then director William Shawcross, who runs the Charity Commission, said “Europe and Islam is one of the greatest, most terrifying problems of our future”. The complaint was lodged by Spinwatch, which campaigns for greater transparency in public and corporate life. It said it was concerned the society would not even “comply with Parliament’s modest new transparency rules”. David Miller, a professor of sociology and co-founder of Spinwatch, said the society was “actively avoiding transparency, preferring to ply its trade in the subterranean fashion beloved of the lobbying industry. It is time that all-party parliamentary groups came clean on their corporate and other significant funders so the public and indeed parliamentarians can be clear exactly who is trying to influence their views and behaviour.” Miller said Spinwatch had combed through public records in the US and UK to find out just who donated to the and says that the rightward drift in the Henry Jackson Society has coincided with a hefty rise in donations. In 2009 Spinwatch believed that the society’s total income was £98,000 – a little more than the previous year. This then jumped to £321,000 in 2010 before rising sharply to £815,000 in 2011, until it raked in a high of £1,313,000 in 2013. Much of the money has come from Tory donors such as the Atkin Charitable Foundation, a London-based charity founded by a British businessman turned philanthropist Edward Atkin. It first financed the HJS in 2010 with a modest £5,000 grant, but subsequently the amounts increased considerably, totalling £375,000 between 2011 and 2013. The Stanley Kalms foundation, named after the Dixons boss, also gave the society £100,000 last year. Baron Kalms, once a big Tory donor, called then shadow foreign secretary William Hague an “ignorant armchair critic” for criticising Israel’s actions in the 2006 war in Lebanon. He was expelled from the Tory party in 2009 after voting for Ukip. Another donor is Nina Rosenwald, whose Abstraction Fund donated $10,000 to HJS via a US fundraising arm, the American Friends of the Henry Jackson Society. Rosenwald also finances the US-based rightwing Gatestone Institute which publishes Douglas Murray’s writing alongside Geert Wilders, the founder and leader of the Dutch Party for Freedom who has declared he “hates Islam”. Miller said: “in recent years, the Henry Jackson Society has become increasingly anti-Islam, expressing views characteristic of the far right. Its anti-Islam orientation appears to have garnered it increasing support from a range of conservative funders in both the UK and US. While it continues to pose as favouring a moral approach to foreign policy, it is dabbling in the politics of hate in an approach which is supposed to be the opposite of British values of fair play and the rule of law.” A spokesman for the Henry Jackson Society said that “in compliance with the new parliamentary rules, we are no longer secretariat of the all-parliamentary groups in question. We do not comment on individual donors,” adding that claims the charity was anti-Islam were “scurrilous and unfounded”. “Having failed to win the arguments with us in policy terms, our critics are doing what all those who have failed in the public domain resort to in desperate times – playing the man rather than the ball. We trust that ordinary people can see through their spin and lies to focus on the good work we are doing for the benefit of British society.”",diasaster:0},

And even Australians arguably haven’t been looking at him very closely. We know this because Stefanovic, a TV anchor, recently confessed to wearing the same cheap blue suit on air every day for a year to see if anyone noticed (they didn’t). But what makes Stefanovic rather more than a skinflint in a stale-smelling jacket is that he did it to prove a point. As a man, even working in a visual medium, he’s judged on how he does the job.

There are two reasons, then, to admire Stefanovic. One is for standing up to bullying, which is what this is, rather than straight-up sexism (women can be other women’s worst critics).

Given the perils of gambling addiction, it is inexcusable that government allows the cheeky cockney/bit of a laugh advertising that surrounds sports events and sports stars and is distanced from the grim reality. Banning sports advertising would be a start. Cultural acceptance should be challenged. The National Lottery is a scandal. While many of its causes are noble, its methods are not. Scratch cards, tacky TV and sensational jackpots are as bad as fixed-odds terminals. The most money is contributed by those least able to afford it.

{ "title":"Labour needs to take back control of the immigration debate", "content": "The usual tendency at this time of year is to say, in an optimistic way, that at least next year can’t be as bad as this one. I wish I could say that but I don’t think I can. From January, a new rabble-rousing rhetoric will be ringing out from the Oval Office, making sparks fly into powder-keg elections in France and the Netherlands. If one of these were to go the wrong way, it could have a domino effect, stoking tensions in the UK in a year in which the possibility of a general election cannot be discounted. The best way for Britain to insulate itself against the wave of hard-right populism sweeping the world is to build a broad, cross-party consensus around our response to Brexit. This task is now bigger than party politics. Extremists thrive on fear and uncertainty and we must work across party lines to take these away. We need a plan to bring a divided country back together. Andy Burnham: Labour wrong to put single market ahead of immigration Read more If we are to learn lessons for the future, we need to ask ourselves how on earth British politics arrived at this point. For at least a decade, Labour activists have been hearing concerns on doorsteps about free movement and immigration. Some of these could be dismissed as xenophobia or, worse, racism. But not all. When people raised concerns such as pressure on jobs, wages, housing and primary schools, we had no answer. Activists were left avoiding people’s eyes and shuffling away. We all know the truth of this. But there has been a collective failure to do anything about it. That failure has had real consequences and contributed to the loss of the Rreferendum. There are two problems with the way the left has approached immigration. First, because immigration is by definition a divisive issue, I think people on the left have a tend ency to shy away from it. The trouble is politics sometimes requires us to face up to difficult issues. On this issue, we have failed.This first problem is compounded by a tendency to label people who speak up. Accusations of “pandering to Ukip”, xenophobia or even racism are thrown around quite freely. This has the chilling effect of making people who speak out fearful of doing so again. Labour dealt with immigration in 1965 – and it can do so again | Martin Kettle Read more There is a real danger of a growing class divide on this issue on the left of politics. The impression is building that some middle-class Labour remain voters are dismissive of Labour leave voters, who they see as uneducated or xenophobic. Remember that many places in the north that voted to leave accept the vast majority of asylum seekers and refugees without any difficulty. That is because these places are full of decent people who value the role migrants play in our public services. But while it is right to point out that immigration provides an overall net benefit to the country, many of us have been slow to realise that it has a differential impact on different places. Free movement helped build the dynamism of our big cities but made life harder in places where there is a high concentration of lower skilled, lower wage employment. The Bank of England has produced evidence that, in the lowest paid occupations, immigration has created a downward pressure on wages. Big companies have used free movement to move people around like commodities to drive down labour costs and create a race to the bottom. What on earth is socialist about that? The time has come for the left to break out of this dysfunctional cycle of denial and overreaction. By specifying single market access as our highest priority in the Brexit negotiations, we are getting things in the wrong order and, once again, avoiding the real issue. The implication of this policy position is that, if Europe made accepting freedom of movement in its current form its price, we would acceptit. That is it is not what a majority of people voted for. We can all debate what the referendum vote meant beyond the decision to leave the EU. Above all, I am clearit was a majority vote for an end to the current system of free movement. As a result, we must now open our minds to options that provide for greater control, and judge each on the effect it would have on our access to the single market. This is the crux of the Brexit debate, that will unfold in the New Year and Labour needs to get ahead of it. I believe a clear majority of people – whether they voted remain or leave – want us to continue to be an outward-looking country, but also want more control in our immigration system. That is what we must now deliver. To lay the foundations, the government should move now to guarantee the right to remain of all EU nationals who came here before 23 June. There will be those who argue that any changes we make must be minimal so as to maximise access to the single market. They may well be right, and it could be that this is where the national interest lies. But the test will be whether the changes to free movement meet public concerns.We need to be ready to re-examine long-held positions. Somewhere along the way, the European left became the champion of an unfettered, free market approach to the movement of goods, capital and people. We failed to see the impact of these policies on people who had suffered the effects of deindustrialisation, and on widening inequality. Labour’s Brexit spokesman Keir Starmer is right to indicate a willingness to reassess these things. The Liberal Democrats, by contrast, have made a conscious decision to speak only for the 48% and the status quo by re-running the arguments of the referendum. As politics across the world continues to polarise, the British national interest urgently requires people to swim against the tide and find compromise. Labour has an opportunity to speak for a majority of people on both sides of the referendum divide by advocating a balanced approach to Brexit that starts with a change to free movement but preserves Britain as an open, welcoming place. An uncertain country needs to hear that voice of reason now, more than ever.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"What next for Syria, its allies and foes after fall of Aleppo?", "content": "While US and European politicians wring their hands and indulge in recriminations over the fall of Aleppo, Russia, Iran and Bashar al-Assad’s Syrian regime are celebrating a “historic” victory they believe has turned the tide in the six-year-old war. “Is there nothing you will not lie about? Do you have no shame?” demanded Samantha Power, US ambassador to the UN, accusing the three allies of barbarism and continuing atrocities as rebel territory fell to pro-Assad forces. Anybody who expected the Russians to show contrition over Aleppo has not studied the denouement of the second Chechen war in 2000. Vladimir Putin, Russia’s then newly installed president, ordered the extermination of separatist resistance. When the siege of Grozny ended, the UN described Chechnya’s capital as “the most destroyed city on earth”. Until now. Putin employed similar ruthlessness to destroy Aleppo from the air, determined to end the war by military means. Russian diplomats have mostly used on-off US- and UN-brokered peace talks to play for time, running out the clock on the Obama administration while pro-Assad forces advanced. Now the question arises: what next for Syria? While the conflict may have tilted decisively against the so-called moderate rebel forces backed by the west, Saudi Arabia and its Gulf partners, it is not over. Assad’s regime remains weak, and critically beholden to foreign powers. And there are signs his victorious allies are already falling out, like thieves squabbling over the spoils. Russia, whose forceful intervention in 2015 blindsided the US, may now seek to wind down its costly military involvement, while playing up its role as the premier Middle East power-broker. To this end, Putin announced on Friday that he would convene peace talks for later this month, attended by Iran and Turkey but none of the Gulf states or western powers. He will keep his air and naval bases in Syria. He will keep Assad under his thumb. But he will to try to disprove Barack Obama’s prediction that Russia will be sucked into an open-ended quagmire similar to Afghanistan in the 1980s. Russia’s current alliance of convenience with Iran could quickly become problematic. Iranian-backed Shia militias from Lebanon, Iraq and Afghanistan did most of the ground fighting in Aleppo. Tehran is in triumphal mood. It interprets Aleppo as a symbolic victory over its old enemy the US and the Sunni leadership of its arch-rival Saudi Arabia. There is revived talk of an Iranian “Shia crescent” stretching from Afghanistan through Iraq and Yemen to the Mediterranean. Unlike Moscow, Tehran views its successes through a sectarian prism. “We see it as our duty to support those trying to force takfiri [Sunni jihadi] terrorism out of their territory,” the president, Hassan Rouhani, told Assad in a celebratory phone call. The very real prospect of ongoing sectarian struggle in Syria is not attractive for Moscow. It carries uncomfortable echoes of the Sunni insurgency against US and UK forces in post-invasion Iraq. Now that the moderate rebel forces are sidelined and dispersed, Iran’s maximalist approach could strengthen support among Syria’s Sunni majority for al-Qaida-linked jihadis whose forces are now concentrating in Idlib, south-west of Aleppo. It could even boost Islamic State, which still controls a large swath of territory around Raqqa in the north. For Putin, the bigger picture includes indications that the incoming Trump administration may seek an accommodation with Moscow. Unlike Obama, Donald Trump has indicated he could accept Assad remaining in power if it advances the fight against Isis. But he and his hawkish new security team are fiercely hostile to Iran. In return for normalising relations, accepting Russia’s position in Syria and, for example, burying the hatchet over Ukraine, Trump could demand Moscow back away from Iran, end arms sales and nuclear industry cooperation, and help curb Isis and Tehran’s sectarian ambitions in Syria and Iraq. A grand bargain of this kind would suit Israel, where alarm is growing at the likelihood that Iranian-directed militias, notably Hezbollah, will soon deploy along its border with Syria, particularly the disputed Golan Heights. In a warning to Rouhani this week, Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel’s prime minister, accused Iran of plotting to destroy his country. “Don’t threaten us. We are not a rabbit, we are a tiger. If you threaten us, you endanger yourself,” Netanyahu warned. Israel counts Moscow as a kind of ally these days, a reflection of Netanyahu’s bad relationship with Obama. It would probably accept a Russian-imposed settlement in Syria if it brought stability and squeezed out Iran. Doubtless this possibility will be discussed during Netanyahu’s upcoming meeting with Trump and Rex Tillerson, Trump’s pro-Moscow nominee as secretary of state. Syria’s future integrity and stability will also be determined to a large degree by Turkey, which has established a military presence in the north of the country – the only Nato member to do so. Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, Turkey’s president, is one of the war’s losers. He pressed hard for Assad’s departure. He covertly backed Sunni jihadis. He sought to contain Syria’s anti-regime Kurds, but was thwarted by Washington. And he simultaneously exploited the crisis to suppress Turkey’s indigenous Kurds. His harsh tactics produced a spate of retaliatory Isis and Kurdish terrorist attacks on Turkish cities. Now, with his foe Assad untoppled and his own leadership shaken by last summer’s failed army coup, Erdogan’s priority is security, internal and external. To this end, he has patched up relations with Putin after Turkey shot down a Russian warplane last year. Excluding the western powers, Turkey and Russia arranged this week’s Aleppo evacuation deal. Erdoğan is also cooperating with Iran, majority Sunni Turkey’s historical Persian-Ottoman imperial competitor. Their shared interests include curbing Isis and quashing Kurdish autonomy. Like Turkey, Iran has a large ethnic Kurdish minority. But as a recent analysis by the independent International Crisis Group pointed out, this collaboration may fall victim to old rivalries and suspicions as both countries seek to shape a future Syrian settlement, competing for control, territory and resources. “The dynamics instead point toward deepening sectarian tensions, greater bloodshed, growing instability across the region and greater risks of direct – even if inadvertent – military confrontation between [Turkey and Iran] where their spheres of influence collide,” the ICG said, pointing to the recent killing of Turkish soldiers in northern Syria, allegedly by an Iranian drone. For the US and the EU, the fall of Aleppo, Assad’s survival and Russia’s and Iran’s ascendancy represent a generational foreign policy setback. Samantha Power’s attack reflected Washington’s impotent rage. American influence in the Middle East is now at a very low ebb, at the very moment when the region is at its most chaotic. By general agreement, Europe’s management of the crisis on its doorstep has been nothing short of disastrous. The consequences, in terms of terrorism, migration, instability and the damage done to the EU’s credibility as an international actor will be long-lasting. Over what happens next in Syria, Europe will have little or no say.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"UK Ebola patient was cleared to leave Heathrow despite health concerns", "content": "The Scottish nurse who contracted the Ebola virus was cleared to leave Heathrow earlier this week despite raising concerns about her own health, prompting questions over the effectiveness of the UK’s screening process. Pauline Cafferkey, a community nurse in Blantyre, South Lanarkshire, had told medics she was worried she had Ebola but was given the all-clear to catch a British Airways flight to Glasgow on Sunday evening, according to Public Health England (PHE). The 39-year-old, whose identity emerged on Tuesday, was receiving specialist treatment in an isolation unit at the Royal Free hospital in London on Tuesday night having been transferred from Gartnavel hospital in Glasgow. Dame Sally Davies, the chief medical officer, conceded there were questions over whether officials should have been “more precautionary” about Cafferkey’s concerns, but stressed that the risk to the public was extremely low. Pauline Cafferkey told medics she was worried she had Ebola before being given the all-clear to catch a BA flight to Glasgow. Photograph: PA A nurse for 16 years, Cafferkey was one of 30 NHS volunteers who spent five weeks helping to treat Ebola patients in Sierra Leone with Save the Children. She was described by colleagues as “terribly committed”. Before flying to the affected region, she told BBC’s Good Morning Scotland: “For me, it was kind of a natural thing; I couldn’t think of any reason not to go.” She wrote from Sierra Leone for the Scotsman about the “all consuming” nature of her work with victims there and of the sadness of seeing whole families who had died from the disease. Cafferkey had returned on Sunday night on a flight from Freetown to Heathrow via Casablanca. While at Heathrow, she was screened alongside the other health workers but asked for a second temperature test because she was worried she had contracted the virus. Health officials said she passed six extra checks and was cleared to catch her internal British Airways flight, BA 1478, from London to Glasgow. Asked why Cafferkey was allowed to fly, Davies said: “She was cleared to travel because she did not have a significantly raised temperature. It does raise a question about whether we should be more precautionary.” The development came after PHE vowed to review its quarantine procedures after they were branded “utterly illogical” by an NHS doctor who returned from Africa with Cafferkey. Dr Martin Deahl, who sat next to Cafferkey on a flight to the UK from Sierra Leone, told the Guardian public health was being put at risk by “totally inadequate” screening facilities at Heathrow airport. He also criticised PHE guidance that allows health workers who have had direct contact with Ebola victims to travel home on public transport from a UK airport, but tells them not to catch buses, trains or planes or enter crowded places once they are at home. In response, PHE confirmed it would review its screening procedures but said they were in line with other organisations that had sent volunteers to tackle the Ebola outbreak in west Africa. Officials are urgently trying to trace those who took the same flights as Cafferkey. More than 100 passengers have still not been traced. Davies confirmed that Cafferkey would be offered plasma from European Ebola survivors, including the British nurse William Pooley, who recovered from Ebola in September. Davies said the experimental drug ZMapp, which was used to treat Pooley, was not available. She stressed that the risk to the general public of contracting Ebola was still extremely low and called for accurate reporting of the ways that Ebola can be spread – through bodily fluids and not merely skin contact. Dr Paul Cosford, PHE’s medical director, acknowledged the authorities had come under criticism but said the government’s plans for containing Ebola were robust. He said everyone who sat within two rows of Cafferkey on the flight had been advised to take their temperature regularly until 18 January. In a statement to the Guardian, PHE said: “The Scottish patient was on the returning worker scheme and was screened at Heathrow airport on arrival, in line with standard procedures. At this point they were assessed as per protocol and cleared to travel home. This process was overseen by a medical consultant. “Naturally, we are keen to learn whatever we can from the emerging details of this case and will be reviewing what happened and the screening protocols, to see if anything needs to be changed.” At a press conference, Scotland’s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, said she believed the rules were robust, but would be kept under review. She said the risk to the wider public was negligible. Separately, it was confirmed that two other people who had been in west Africa were being tested for Ebola, one in Aberdeen and one in Cornwall. The “low risk” Scottish patient is a female healthcare worker who is not thought to have had direct contact with people infected with Ebola but became unwell after recently returning from a country affected by the outbreak. . She had been staying at a youth hostel in the Highlands and was expected to arrive at Aberdeen Royal infirmary for tests. She was photographed wearing a mask on her face as she was met by medical staff in protective suits at the hospital. Described by Scottish health authorities as “low risk”, she is not thought to have had any direct contact with people infected with Ebola but became unwell following her recent return from a country with an outbreak. Late last night, she was given the all-clear. The Cornish patient, who also recently returned from a country affected by Ebola, has been placed in isolation at the Royal Cornwall hospital in Treliske, Truro.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Alexei Navalny detained after breaking house arrest to join rally in Moscow", "content": "The Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny was arrested on Tuesday after breaking house arrest to join an opposition rally in Moscow, hours after a court gave him a suspended sentence for fraud. His brother, Oleg, was jailed for three and a half years for the same offence. Police arrested Navalny soon after he emerged from the metro. Officers detained him outside the Ritz Carlton hotel, in Tverskaya street, before he had a chance to join demonstrators trying to reach the heavily guarded Manezh square, directly in front of the Kremlin. Thousands of protesters gathered in freezing conditions to protest against the verdict on Navalny and his brother. They chanted anti-Putin slogans including: “No Putin, no war”, “Crimea is not ours”, “Putin is a thief” and “freedom”. More than 100 protesters were arrested, including a Wall Street Journal reporter, and loaded into waiting buses, to cries of “shame!”. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Pussy Riot, the Russian feminist punk band, has released a video calling for a protest against the Navalny verdict outside the Kremlin. “Look how much they fear us, as if we were enemies. Navalny and [Russian president Vladimir] Putin are now real enemies. Today’s verdict made Alexei very angry,” Svetlana Guseva, an oncologist and longtime opposition activist, said. “Anger will make us stronger,” she added. Some of those detained tweeted photos from inside police vans. Navalny tweeted that officials had taken him to a police station and then taken him back to his flat. Five police guards stood outside his door to prevent him from leaving again. In a case which critics say was politically motivated, the judge earlier handed Navalny – Vladimir Putin’s most high-profile opponent – a suspended three-and-a-half-year sentence. He had faced up to 10 years in jail. But in an unexpected move, the court jailed Oleg Navalny and sent him to a penal colony.

Photograph: Yuri Kochetkov /EPA It was unclear whether Alexei Navalny now faces a similar term behind bars after deliberately breaking his bail conditions on Tuesday. He is under house arrest following an earlier conviction. Setting off to the demonstration, he tweeted from the metro: “Yes, there is this house arrest. But today I want to be with you. So I’m coming too.” Navalny’s supporters said Tuesday’s verdict showed the Kremlin was returning to the Soviet-era practice of punishing the relatives of those it disliked. Both men were found guilty of stealing 30m roubles (about £334,000 under the current exchange rate) from the French cosmetics company Yves Rocher. Asked by the judge, Yelena Korobchenko, if the rulings against them were clear, Alexei replied: “Nothing is clear. Why are you imprisoning my brother? By this you punish me even harder.” Facebook Twitter Pinterest A group of police officers detain one of Alexei Navalny’s supporters at the rally. Photograph: Sergei Ilnitsky/EPA The sentencing had originally been scheduled for 15 January, but was abruptly brought forward to the day before New Year’s Eve, the main Russian holiday, in an apparent attempt to prevent large-scale anti-Putin demonstrations. Riot police and military vehicles flooded Manezh Square in anticipation of protests. The authorities had not given permission for the rally, so it was considered illegal. “Of all the possible types of sentence, this is the meanest,” said Alexei Navalny outside court after his brother was taken away. “The government isn’t just trying to jail its political opponents – we’re used to it, we’re aware that they’re doing it – but this time they’re destroying and torturing the families of the people who oppose them,” he said. Writing on his blog,, Navalny said his brother’s sentence would not stop him from political activity. He lambasted those at the top of Kremlin power as “thieves, scoundrels and traitors who must be destroyed”. He also said ordinary Russians were guilty of allowing the political elite to plunder the country. “We let them through our passivity,” he wrote.

Critics said the move was the latest attempt by the Kremlin to shut down Navalny’s long-running anti-corruption campaign against Putin. Navalny’s friend, the opposition leader Ilya Yashin, said: “By taking his own brother as a political hostage, the sinister Kremlin wants to squash Navalny’s spirit, so he shuts up.” The editor-in-chief of the liberal radio Echo of Moscow, Aleksei Venedictov, described the Kremlin’s perceived new strategy against Navalny as “sophisticated torture”. “The verdict is purely political. The Kremlin weakens Alexei by giving him thousands of little wounds. First they keep him for months under house arrest, forbid him to use the internet, then put him on trial, then throw his brother in jail – taking family members hostage is a sensational new strategy,” Venediktov told the Guardian.

Unlike his better-known brother, he has never played a role in the Russian opposition movement. His imprisonment in a penal colony seems to echo the Soviet-era practice of arresting the relatives of inconvenient people. The EU condemned Tuesday’s guilty verdict and said the case against the two brothers “appears to be politically motivated”. It said the trial had failed to substantiate the charges against them. The Russian tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who spent 10 years in jail before he was pardoned last year, dismissed the verdict as Putin’s revenge for Navalny’s activism. Facebook Twitter Pinterest This sign at the rally to support the Navalny brothers reads: ‘Free Navalny’. Photograph: Novoderezhkin Anton/Itar-Tass/Corbis Khodorkovsky said in a statement that he was “not even surprised that Putin and his entourage are capable of vile tricks, deception, forgery and manipulation. They are not capable of anything else.” Hugh Williamson, Europe and central Asia director at Human Rights Watch, said the sentencing might have been designed to warn off other Putin critics. “The sentence, and the imprisoning of his brother, Oleg Navalny, seems aimed not only at punishing Alexei Navalny himself and stopping his anti-corruption work, but also intimidating other critics of the government,” he said. “The Kremlin seems to be telling independent voices to expect a harsher crackdown in 2015. Many factors point to political motivations in the case against Alexei and Oleg Navalny. “By moving up the verdict, the Russian authorities apparently sought to diminish planned demonstrations. They also pushed those planning to protest [against] a guilty verdict to the margins of the law, by denying them enough time to comply with local regulations.”",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Fishing communities' Brexit hopes may be too high, peers say", "content": "The UK’s fishing industry has been warned it will have to accept difficult deals over foreign fleets in British waters if the country is to win favourable terms in next year’s Brexit talks. EU easing of fishing quotas raises scientists fears dwindling stocks Read more A House of Lords committee told fishing communities, who campaigned vigorously for a leave vote during the referendum, that they may have unrealistic hopes about the chances of reducing foreign fleets or cutting their catch sizes once the UK leaves the European Union. The UK’s trawlermen were among the most vocal critics of the EU during the referendum, fuelled by several decades of resentment against increasingly strict controls on fishing quotas, which are blamed on Brussels and the common fisheries policy (CFP), and claims that their interests are too easily traded away. Their campaign culminated in the famous “battle of the Thames” confrontation between a flotilla of trawlers skippered by pro-leave fishermen and led by Nigel Farage, the then Ukip leader, and a pro-EU flotilla led by Bob Geldof. Farage said this issue typified the need for the UK to take back control of its resources from the EU. The Lords energy and environment subcommittee said leaving the EU would allow the UK and devolved administrations to directly control access to the UK’s waters – the largest exclusive economic area in the UK – and its rich fishing grounds. But the fate of those fish stocks was closely linked to the UK’s wider interests, it said. Flexibility during the Brexit negotiations would be essential to protect British trawlers from retaliatory controls on access by its neighbours and also to preserve the UK’s wider trade and political interests in the talks. The peers told ministers that open and low-tariff access to the single market was essential for UK fisheries, because the industry was so integrated and dependent on European markets. The UK would also have to urgently negotiate new bilateral fisheries deals with two of Europe’s most powerful and competitive fishing nations, Norway and Iceland, and with the Faroe Islands. They all have substantial interests in mackerel and herring, the two most valuable catches to the UK. Fish map In 2010, a fleet of 50 Scottish boats blocked a Faroese trawler from entering Peterhead in a dispute over sharing out mackerel and herring stocks, after Nordic fleets decided their share was too small. The incident echoed the cod wars of the 1970s, where Royal Navy warships were confronted by Icelandic coastguard vessels when British boats were excluded from Iceland’s coastal waters, and was also a warning of the potential for future conflicts. “The vote to leave the European Union and, with it, the common fisheries policy has raised expectations for the future of fisheries policy that may be hard to deliver,” peers said. “In withdrawing from the EU, the UK will be able to develop a domestic fisheries policy and control fishing activity within its exclusive economic zone. However, the majority of commercial fish stocks in UK waters are shared with other states, rendering continued cooperation with the EU and other neighbouring states crucial to the sustainability of those stocks.” The committee said fish stocks were mobile and crossed international boundaries, which underlined the need to maintain existing management agreements. “The government should therefore pursue new, or interim, agreements as a matter of urgency, building on existing models where possible,” it said. The subcommittee said even though fisheries made up a tiny fraction of the UK’s GDP – contributing £426m to the economy - ministers had to be aware that they had substantial economic and cultural value to coastal communities. Fish we catch, eat, export The UK government should also collaborate with devolved governments on fisheries policy during the Brexit talks, peers said, to present a united front and prevent fisheries fragmenting into competing areas within the UK. The Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish parliaments legally have jurisdiction over fisheries in their waters through devolution settlements, raising the prospects that they could win full control over policy and quotas too after Brexit. The UK’s fishing industry bodies, who are frequently at odds with each other, signed a joint position statement in November calling on the government to take full control of access by foreign vessels to British waters. They also demanded a full revision of quotas and fisheries management policy, to further distance the UK from the common fisheries policy. The Lords committee said the UK would still need to base its fisheries policies and catch levels on objective scientific data, agreed and shared with neighbouring countries, and base its quotas on international protocols. Despite the industry’s attacks on the CFP, peers said recent changes – heavily influenced by the UK – meant it was now far better run. The rest of the EU would continue to operate under the CFP, making it impossible for the UK to ignore. Bertie Armstrong, the chief executive of the Scottish Fishermen’s Federation, the largest of the industry bodies, said although deals would need to be struck, it was clearly in the UK’s economic interests to greatly tighten up access to British waters. They are the richest and largest fishing grounds of any in the EU, yet 58% of fish was taken by other national fleets while only 17% of the UK’s overall catch came from other waters. “Every nation or state has a set of fundamental assets,” Armstrong said. “One of the UK’s fundamental assets are these exceptionally rich waters. It is not an act of aggression to wish to take up your rights and responsibilities [for those waters] under international law. It’s normal.”",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Arnaud Montebourg: 'French Bernie Sanders' plotting a shakeup", "content": "France cannot keep acting as “gatekeeper to the British crown” at Calais and must stop managing refugees and migrants for the UK, Arnaud Montebourg, a key contender to become the Socialist party’s presidential candidate, has warned. The flamboyant leftist told the Guardian he saw himself as a French version of Bernie Sanders, the US senator who made a bid to become Democratic presidential candidate on the issue of fighting inequality. Montebourg, who quit as economy minister two years ago after leading a rebellion against François Hollande’s pro-business stance, is now running in the Socialists’ open primary race to choose a candidate for the French presidential election next spring. Montebourg told the Guardian that when negotiations begin over the UK’s departure from the European Union, Britain should also be prepared to face discussions over the Le Touquet accords – the deal with France that keeps border checks, and thousands of refugees and migrants, on the French side of the Channel. Under the bilateral treaty signed in 2003, which is separate from any EU accords, British officials can check passports in France and vice-versa, meaning the British border is effectively in France and migrants and refugees trying to reach Britain have found themselves stuck in a no-man’s land in Calais and along France’s northern coast. Montebourg’s stance shows the French left is joining politicians on the right in pushing for a renegotiation of the border deal. He said the Le Touquet accords were “part of the points that will have to be discussed” in the coming months. He said: “Each country has to take its own responsibility, especially if they are no longer in the EU.” He added that it was natural that “while inside the European Union there is a reciprocal solidarity so we can do favours for each other”, but suggested that this would no longer be the case after Brexit and the UK should not assume the Le Touquet accords would remain unchanged. He described France as “a long-term friend, historical ally and good neighbour” of the UK, but said the “damage” from handling migrants and refugees for Britain had been considerable. On the Brexit discussions themselves, Montebourg said: “I want to say very clearly that I’m for a moderate position on the negotiations. But once you leave Europe, there have to be consequences. You can’t have your cake and eat it.” He added: “Our friends in Britain have to choose,” and he said Britain’s exit would have to be firmly fixed, with “no fluidity to their departure”. Montebourg, 54, is one of the most outspoken and controversial figures on France’s deeply fractured left. A staunch leftwing former lawyer with a theatrical style as a thunderous orator, he is an anti-austerity, economic protectionist who, as a government minister, posed in a striped Breton sailor top to insist more must be done to protect the notion of “Made in France”. The ruthlessly effective rebranding of Europe’s new far right Read more At a breakfast meeting in Paris with the Guardian and a handful of international reporters, he frequently banged his fist on the table over the importance of fighting what he called the ravages of globalisation. Born and raised in Burgundy, where he later served as an MP, Montebourg is the son of a tax inspector and a Spanish teacher. One of his grandfathers was Algerian and his French grandparents were local charcutier butchers. As a young lawyer, he became famous for his vehement anti-corruption campaigning, notably in 2001 when he tried but failed to impeach the president Jacques Chirac over an earlier party funding scandal as Paris mayor. As economy minister, Montebourg engaged in vicious spats with international business, telling the steel magnate Lakshmi Mittal in November 2012 that “we no longer want Mittal in France” and threatening to temporarily nationalise two blast furnace sites that were under threat. He was overruled by Hollande. Ousted from government in 2014 for his vocal criticism of Hollande, he went to business school and took a leading position in the furniture group Habitat. He is running for the Socialist nomination promising to end the EU’s austerity drive, raise state spending, lower taxes, fight globalisation and overhaul the French political system to found a new French Republic. He aims to appeal to leftwing voters who feel betrayed by Hollande. It is uncertain how he will fare. He faces the staunchly pro-business former prime minister Manuel Valls, as well as another young leftist, Benoît Hamon, and a former education minister, Vincent Peillon, who rushed to enter the race when the beleaguered and unpopular Hollande said he would not run for a second term. Current polls show that the governing Socialist party is so fractured and unpopular that whoever becomes its candidate has no chance of reaching the second round of the presidential race next May. Currently, the right’s François Fillon and the far-right’s Marine Le Pen are in the lead. Emmanuel Macron, a maverick, independent centrist former economy minister and the hard-left Jean-Luc Mélenchon are seriously eating into the left’s vote and threaten to limit the Socialist party’s chances. Montebourg said he wanted to reunite a French left that had been “chopped into pieces” by years of spats over economic policy. For him, the Socialists needed to drop any Blairite, pro-business shift to the centre and return firmly to the hard left. “The left moving right didn’t work,” he said. “So the left must be left if it is to stand for anything and fulfil its historic mission.” Describing himself as a pro-European who wanted to totally overhaul the EU, he said 2017’s French presidential election was the last chance to reform Europe and stem the rise of populism. “This election is the last gas station before the desert. Otherwise serious events will undo Europe. If France votes for Marine Le Pen, there will be no Europe left. Things are very serious, so if reformers who are passionate about the idea of Europe don’t succeed now, it will all be over.”",diasaster:0},

{ "title":"Don’t call it post-truth. There’s a simpler word: lies", "content": "Sixteen years ago, I sat in court 73 of the Royal Courts of Justice in London and felt the ground crumble beneath my feet. I was following the libel trial brought by David Irving, the Holocaust denier and “pro-Nazi polemicist” – to quote the judge’s eventual verdict – against Penguin Books, which had dared publish a text which told the truth about him. I watched as Irving discarded the usual rules of evidence. The eyewitness testimony of survivors was dismissed as lies. Confessions by the guilty were waved away as fake. Inconvenient documents were written off as forgeries. All that was left was what he wanted to believe. At the time, it struck me that Irving was threatening something greater even than the memory of the Holocaust: he was undermining the very idea of facts, history and truth. If every item of evidence could be rubbished as bogus, then how could anyone ever prove anything? How would we know that Henry VIII had six wives or that Napoleon fought at Waterloo? Donald Trump says CIA charge Russia influenced election is 'ridiculous' Read more Hence the queasy sensation the ground was falling away. As I wrote at the time: “If we start to doubt corroborated facts, how can we prevent ourselves being swallowed up in doubt, unable to trust anything we see? It might all be a conspiracy, a legend, a hoax. This is the bizarre, never-never world inhabited by David Irving. Now the court has to decide: is this our world too?” That feeling returned to me this week, brought back by a screening of the film Denial, released next month, which dramatises the Irving trial of 2000. But it was also prompted by the reaction to events in Aleppo and, more widely, by the way 2016 has punched truth in the face, leaving it bruised and bleeding. As Aleppo endured its final agonies, the simple act of circulating any account – a video, a photograph, a news report – would trigger an unnerving response. Someone, somewhere would reply that the photograph was doctored, the source was a stooge, the rescued child was not really a child or not really rescued. Of course, we’re used to people taking different sides on conflicts far away, arguing bitterly over who is to blame. At its most extreme, it results in a newspaper like the Morning Star sinking so low that it hails the human devastation of Aleppo – where every hospital was bombed and where the slaughter of civilians became routine – not as a crime, but as a “liberation”. But this is about more than assigning blame for this death or that bombing. This is about refusing to accept that the death or bombing occurred at all. This is about defenders of Bashar al-Assad, and his Russian and Iranian enablers, coming on television to say that what is happening on the ground is not happening, that it is all an illusion. The late US senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan used to say: “You’re entitled to your own opinion, but you’re not entitled to your own facts.” But that distinction seems to have broken down. Now people regard facts as very much like opinions: you can discard the ones you don’t like. This problem is not confined to Syria. This week the CIA joined 17 other US intelligence agencies in concluding that Russia was behind the hacking of Democratic emails, adding its conclusion that Moscow had done so in order to tilt the US election towards Donald Trump. “Ridiculous,” said Trump, who has not looked at the CIA’s evidence and has refused to receive the daily intelligence briefing provided for all incoming presidents on the grounds that he is “like, a smart person”. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Trump ‘flying blind’ if he ignores intelligence, warns Obama After Iraq and the weapons of mass destruction that never were, plenty are understandably wary of accepting the word of the intelligence agencies. But Trump’s scepticism – cynicism is a better word – operates on a different level. “Nobody really knows,” he says about the hacking charges, the very words he uses about climate change, in the face of a vast body of evidence. Recall that he also says that he won the US popular vote “if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally”, a flagrantly false claim for which there is no evidence whatsoever. We’ve been calling this “post-truth politics” but I now worry that the phrase is far too gentle, suggesting society has simply reached some new phase in its development. It lets off the guilty too lightly. What Trump is doing is not “engaging in post-truth politics”. He’s lying. Worse still, Trump and those like him not only lie: they imply that the truth doesn’t matter, showing a blithe indifference to whether what they say is grounded in reality or evidence. Back in 2000, such a posture left you isolated in that never-never world inhabited by Irving. Today you’ll have a US president, a British foreign secretary (never forget the £350m Brexit bus), as well as a ready army of fake news consumers to keep you company. How has this happened so quickly? Technology has clearly played a part. Social media allows fact deniers to spread their anti-history fast and wide. Distrust in elites is also central. People are no longer prepared to take their leaders’ word on trust. Iraq poisoned that relationship, but its roots go deeper. In the US, Watergate broke public faith; some suspect the rot set in even earlier, with the Kennedy assassination. But a crucial shift is surely the trend towards deeper and more bitter partisanship. Once people have aligned themselves with a tribe, studies show their first instinct will be to believe what favours their side and disbelieve what favours their opponent. One telling poll this week found Vladimir Putin’s approval ratings have shot up among US Republicans. They once hated him, but now their guy Trump is Putin’s buddy, they’re ready to see the Russian autocrat in a favourable light – and to ignore all evidence to the contrary. Post-truth? My word of the year is normalisation – as applied to Trump | Peter Bradshaw Read more This is making our public sphere a dizzying place. Without a common, agreed set of facts, we can hardly have any kind of public conversation at all. Writer David Roberts, who has a good claim to have coined the phrase “post-truth” [see footnote], says that these days: “There are no more referees. There are only players.” We have no group of non-partisan arbiters, trusted to define at least the factual basis for our collective discussion. When actual judges enter the picture, as they have in the Brexit article 50 case, one side rushes to discredit them, branding them as biased, ideological partisans, no less tainted and untrustworthy than everyone else: enemies of the people. What’s so odd about this is that we are happy to accept that there are facts, and judges of fact, in every other aspect of our lives. Philosopher Quassim Cassam notes if a car mechanic says your brakes have broken, you don’t denounce him as biased and drive on: you listen. If a doctor says you have a tumour, you don’t mock him as a member of the medical elite. We even accept expert judgment on reality TV: no one minds Mary Berry deciding who should win Bake Off. Only in the political realm have we somehow drifted into a world in which no one can be trusted, not on questions of judgment, nor even on questions of fact. But we cannot live in such a world. Evidence, facts and reason are the building blocks of civilisation. Without them we plunge into darkness. • This footnote was added on 20 December 2016.

{ "title":"The gift: small acts of kindness change the world for the better", "content": "Every December, my church fills about 2,000 cardboard boxes with turkeys, brussels sprouts, Quality Street and all the other edibles that make up Christmas. We personally deliver these hampers to local people who find it hard to make ends meet at Christmas. When I was a teenager, I gladly went knocking on strangers’ doors to deliver the red and gold boxes, but in my 20s I developed a new cynicism. I dutifully donated the £25 it cost to make up a hamper, but I balked at handing out the boxes in person. It felt too much like playing lady bountiful. Coming from an African context, charity can feel like a dirty word – synonymous with power and its abuse, with the pride of the benefactor and the belittling, even exploitation, of the recipient. Yet there is also an older meaning of charity, from the Latin caritas, a root of the word that is more synonymous with love. So one December, hearing we were short of volunteers, I decided to sign up and rediscover the meaning of caritas. Delivery day arrived, the Saturday before Christmas, and it was snowing as it never does in December. Surely it was a sign from the heavens that I should roll over in bed and pull my duvet over my head. I got to church certain the event would be cancelled, or at least subcontracted to professionals trained to carry heavy loads in the snow. No such luck. Most of the volunteers had shown up, the boxes were stacked in the vans, and we were ready to go. My group was sent to a council estate. Our instructions were simple. Knock. Smile. Explain. Deliver. It is easy to dismiss individual acts of kindness because they appear to change little in the grand scheme of things As some families had specifically asked for the hampers or received them in previous years, they didn’t need an explanation. Yet even families that were expecting us and were ready with mugs of tea still asked us why. Why did we wake up on a Saturday morning to hand out turkeys? And why, especially, did we do this in the snow? An attempt at love, we answered. A caritas that crossed race, religion, gender and every conceivable boundary. We delivered to a vegetarian family who wanted everything but the turkey. We delivered to Muslim, Sikh and atheist families. I delivered to a man who thought I was selling the hamper, and insisted that he didn’t want to pay for the whole box, just the shortbread. We delivered to pensioners. We didn’t all believe the same things, or share the same views, but nevertheless we had connected over a box of food. There were tears and hugs and enough warm, fuzzy feelings to melt a little more off the polar ice caps. At the end of the day I felt cold, but I also felt good. Too good, I thought. What exactly had we achieved? Two thousand households would have a nice Christmas lunch. So what? Had we fixed the structural inequalities that meant that more and more families each year were phoning the church because they could not afford a Christmas lunch? And if they couldn’t afford Christmas lunch, what of new year, and birthdays and anniversaries and all the other celebrations I took for granted? Where were the hampers for then? Yet this cold, statistical assessment of the day did not fit my experience of it. From a lofty, dispassionate height, it is easy to dismiss individual acts of kindness because they appear to change little in the grand scheme of things. But I had knocked on doors, and held hands, and smiled and seen how important it was for people to know they were remembered. I had seen how important it was to know that, even between strangers, there could be love. Can individual acts of kindness change anything? Surely the inequalities and injustices of this world are as fixed as the points of latitude. The hungry will always be hungry. The poor will always get poorer and the rich will always get richer. That is the way of the world. Yet every unjust system is built on a million acts of unkindness that solidify into the norm. Habitual unkindness hardens into the shrug that says: “Oh that’s how we’ve always done things.” In Nigeria, politicians have always stolen money. In Switzerland, bankers have always stashed their loot. In the UK, some CEOs have never seen fit to pay the right tax. In my neighbourhood, we always walk past each other without a smile. On the underground, there will always be people crying and there will always be people walking past. It is the aggregate of individual unkindness that has undone the world; it is the accretion of kindness that will change it. Small acts of love, replicated and duplicated and permutated, move the seemingly unmovable. Grain by grain, a different world is built.

{ "title":"Afghanistan's fight for Sangin: a key psychological battle for both sides", "content": "Sangin, a key town in Helmand province, Afghanistan, has for years been the scene of fierce fighting between the Taliban and Nato forces. Sangin is totemic for British and US troops, with both having suffered a high death toll there. Its loss would be a psychological blow as well as providing the Taliban with an important base. Afghan forces have been battling for days to prevent the complete fall of the town, according to government officials in Kabul. Residents report that the insurgents are in control of at least 50% of the town. Sangin assault is sign of Taliban confidence and warning to Kabul Read more With access by road difficult, the Afghan government has been forced again to resupply its troops from the air. Residents have reported that they are also running out of food and water, with the streets deserted after warnings from the Taliban to stay at home. Saifudin Sanginwal, a tribal elder in Sangin district, said: “There is no support for the Afghan national security forces from the central government. For three days, they haven’t had enough food or ammunition.” He added that some forces had defected to the Taliban because of a shortage of supplies. There was a serious lack of cooperation between the police, army and Afghan special forces, Sanginwal said, although he added that the situation had begun to improve for Afghan forces after an airstrike at about 3pm local time on Tuesday. Qari Yousaf, a Taliban spokesman, said the siege was continuing “and the government will soon announce [its] defeat”. The loss of Sangin would be a setback for the Afghan government, which is trying to retain control of the country, and for the US, the UK and others in the coalition looking for a way to extricate themselves from the country after 14 years of conflict. The Taliban takeover of Kunduz in the north in September for three days undermined the authority of Kabul. Sangin is psychologically important too for the UK, given that more than 100 British troops died preventing its fall to the Taliban. The UK sent a modest contingent of British military advisers to Helmand at the weekend to support the overstretched forces. The 10 British troops, part of a 300-strong Nato force, are based at Camp Shorabak, about 50 miles from Sangin. The MoD said they would remain inside the camp to provide advice and infantry training and would not be involved in combat. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Afghan security forces patrol near their base in the Marjah district of Helmand province. Photograph: Noor Mohammad/AFP/Getty Images Although the number of British troops is tiny, it is hugely symbolic – a return to the province 14 months after they pulled down their flag. US special forces have been supporting Afghan forces in Helmand for several months. Bilal Sarwary, a freelance journalist, tweeted that villagers in Greashk district in Helmand province said they had seen western special forces in the area on the ground on Monday morning. A US military source was quoted on Monday saying US special forces were also supporting Afghan forces in Sangin and that a British SAS unit was working alongside them. The UK’s Ministry of Defence said it never comments on the deployment of special forces, but the BBC said it understood that the reports of SAS involvement in Helmand were incorrect. The UK has 450 troops in Afghanistan, mainly engaged in officer training in Kabul. Mothers of British soldiers lament 'waste' after fall of Sangin Read more As well as Afghanistan, the UK is contributing small numbers of troops – also in advisory and training roles – to Iraq, Ukraine, Nigeria and possibly Libya, raising concerns about being overstretched. Lord Dannatt, former chief of the general staff, told the BBC the government would have to think long and hard about any expansion of its role in Afghanistan. “We can’t do all of those things – the government has got to decide what its priority is,” he said. A resident who fled Sangin, Haji Abdul Qader, told AFP that the Taliban had publicly executed at least three security officials after storming government buildings. “The Taliban dragged two intelligence officials and a local police commander from their homes and shot them dead,” he said. “Only the governor’s compound and the police headquarters are under government control. The rest have been overrun by the Taliban.” Qader said he fled to the Helmand provincial capital Lashkar Gah after a mortar bomb landed on his house, wounding his infant son and daughter. Another resident, Atiqullah Rehman, said he too wanted to flee the area but has been unable to. His family had not eaten for the past two days, he said. “Since the Taliban took over the district, all the markets have been shut. Everyone is trying to leave but we cannot step out of our homes,” Rehman told al-Jazeera. “We might get shot. This is how bad it is here.”",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Valerie Gell obituary", "content": "In the 1960s, Valerie Gell, who has died aged 71, was part of the all-female Liverpool teenage beat group the Liverbirds. They had their greatest success in Hamburg, with residencies at the Star-Club, where the Beatles had played on and off throughout 1962 before their chart breakthrough and where the Liverbirds were billed as “die weiblichen Beatles” (the female Beatles). Although presented as a gimmick, they could play well and were trend-setting in that other girls saw it was possible to be in a beat group. The proliferation of teenage groups had started in the mid-1950s with the advent of skiffle music on acoustic instruments and went electric with rock’n’roll. When, in 1961, the disc jockey at the Cavern Club in Liverpool, Bob Wooler, drew up a list of local beat groups, of the nearly 300 he identified, almost all were male. The audiences preferred it that way, it seemed: the girls wanted to see the lads, and John Lennon spoke for the lads when he told the Liverbirds that girls couldn’t play guitars. They set out to prove him wrong. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Valerie Gell, far right, with the Liverbirds outside the Star-Club, Hamburg, in 1963. Photograph: K&K Ulf Kruger/Redferns The daughter of Tom, a docker, and Joyce, a factory worker, Valerie was born in the Liverpool suburb of Seaforth. On leaving school, she worked in the local department store, Owen Owen. She learned to play the guitar and her friend Sylvia Saunders took up the drums. They saw a feature in the Mersey Beat newspaper about three cousins and a friend forming a beat group called the Squaws. When they contacted the Squaws, they found that they couldn’t really play, but Val coached two of the cousins, Sheila and Mary McGlory, and, with Irene Green on vocals, in 1963 they became the Liverbirds. They took their name from the heraldic symbol for Liverpool: the TV comedy series The Liver Birds did not start until 1969. Sheila soon left for another band and Irene became a club singer under the name Tiffany. Val (lead guitar), Mary (bass) and Sylvia (drums) recruited a new singer and guitarist, Pam Birch. They had a harder, more rhythm and blues outlook than most Liverpool bands. They supported the Rolling Stones, the Kinks, Alexis Korner and the Hamburg band the Rattles, who were seeking fame in the UK. Then, in early 1964, they were offered a residency at the Star-Club. The venue was in the tough St Pauli area of Hamburg, surrounded by sex clubs. The Liverbirds were pilloried in the People newspaper, as playing beat music was not considered a suitable occupation for young ladies from Liverpool, and certainly not in a red-light district. However, German teenagers loved them and they recorded singles and albums for the Star-Club’s own label. In May 1965, they had a German Top 40 hit with Diddley Daddy; other popular singles were Shop Around and Peanut Butter. In 1966 they appeared in the film Hurra! Die Rattles Kommen!, the Rattles’ attempt at A Hard Day’s Night. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Video: The Liverbirds performing their 1965 hit Diddley Daddy They performed many Chuck Berry songs and, when they opened for him at the Deutschlandhalle in Berlin, Berry’s manager was furious about it. When he tried to go on stage to stop them, Val pushed him off. Val sang many of the more raucous numbers, including Road Runner and Got My Mojo Workin’. Ray Davies of the Kinks described her as a “fantastic musician”. Val’s German boyfriend, Stephane Hausner, was due to watch the band on his 18th birthday. His parents had given him a new car and he crashed it. As a result of his injuries, he became paralysed from the neck down. He and Val married and settled in Munich. She spent the next 26 years looking after him, and quit the Liverbirds when they were offered some gigs in Japan as she could not leave him. In later years, Hausner became blind and developed multiple sclerosis, and they eventually separated. He predeceased her. Val moved back to Hamburg, with a new partner, Susann Nilson, and took part in occasional Liverbirds reunions. Susann survives her. • Valerie Ann Gell, musician, born 14 August 1945; died 11 December 2016",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Recycled bank accounts can mean sending money to the wrong person", "content": "A chartered accountant and his wife are £1,100 out of pocket after discovering that their son’s old bank account number has been given to someone else. The couple have learned to their cost something that every person who banks online should know: it’s not just things such as paper and glass that are recycled. Banks can, and do, recycle closed account details. David and Lyndsay Boyack from the Scottish city of Stirling are the latest people to discover that transferring money via online banking can be fraught with peril. But this wasn’t a fat finger error, whereby you erroneously key in the wrong account number and the money goes to an unintended recipient; and it also wasn’t one of those nasty email scams where someone is duped into paying money to a fraudster posing as their builder/carpenter etc. In this case, Lyndsay made several separate payments into what she thought was her 33-year-old son’s current account, but is actually now someone else’s account – and this person is refusing to give the money back. Her son’s name, account number and sort code were among the list of payees saved on her system, but unbeknown to her they were no longer her son’s banking details. In fact, he had closed that account some years previously and subsequently opened another one with the same bank, the Clydesdale. What shocked the couple were the revelations that both the same account number and sort code from their son’s old account had been given to someone else, and that no one within the banking system seems to be able to compel this individual to hand back money that isn’t theirs. The Boyacks’ experience shines a spotlight on the little-known world of current account recycling. Did you know, for example, that your bank account could be “second-hand”? Very little information is available on this, but it is understood that banks typically wait at least three years before recycling closed account details. Clydesdale has confirmed that once one of its accounts has been closed for four years, both the number and sort code can be given to a new customer. Not all banks do this – HSBC doesn’t, and neither does Santander. And it may be the case that of those banks that do do it, some split the account number and sort code. If all old accounts were recycled to different branches, this would presumably have prevented the Boyacks’ error. If proposed new rules for online payments outlined last month were in place now, what happened to the Boyacks would not have been able to occur. In future, when a bank customer transfers some money, they will receive a message matching the sort code and account number with the name of the recipient account holder, so they can double check they are paying the right person (see below). David Boyack, who is 64, admits the whole experience has left the couple frustrated. However, he says they will continue their efforts to recover the money because otherwise it would suggest to him and his wife that “crime does pay”. The Boyacks made four online transfers of funds from the couple’s Royal Bank of Scotland account over a period of 15 months, unwittingly using the details of their son’s old account, which he had closed in 2006 after moving to Glasgow. The first transfer was £50 in December 2014, followed by £100 in February 2015, £150 in December 2015, and £800 in February of this year. Recycling account numbers is common practice due to a limit on the amount of numbers available The couple only realised there was a problem when their son told them the £800 had not arrived. They then realised the same thing had happened three times previously. Initially the couple thought they were the victims of a fraud, and contacted their bank, RBS. When it became clear what had occurred they complained to the Clydesdale. It eventually told them in August that it was unable to give them any more help. In a letter it said it had written twice to the customer who now has those account details to request the money back, “but we have had no response”. The Boyacks then wrote a letter which they asked to be forwarded to the customer, but again there was no reply. Intriguingly, through a spot of detective work they managed to get hold of the customer’s name and also where he works (a cafe in the Manchester area), although they don’t know his home address. “He’s a young chap and we imagine he has spent the money,” says David. His son managed to contact the man via Facebook, without joy, and now David has sent him a recorded delivery letter, to his workplace, asking him to pay back the debt at a rate of £75 a month or £20 a week. The couple took their complaint to the Financial Ombudsman Service, but it ruled that the Clydesdale “hasn’t done anything wrong in this situation” and had “made a reasonable attempt to try to retrieve the funds”. David told Guardian Money that “we do accept some contributory negligence … we [made the transfers] four times”. He acknowledges that if their son had noticed that the first £50 had not arrived then they wouldn’t be where they are now. But he says the FOS has shown itself to be “toothless”, with no solution offered to prevent a recurrence. “Clydesdale ‘made a reasonable attempt’ – I would have expected more. They contacted their client twice. He did not provide debit authorisation, so that’s it?” he says. “The recipient’s crime is that of unjust enrichment, and I am very keen that he pays back what he has ‘taken’ from us.” Boyack adds: “Why is there no flag on recycled accounts? Or better still, why is there not a split of the old account number for re-use with a different sort code? Is there no way to validate the recipient’s name as well, to avoid depositing funds in the wrong account in error?” In a statement Clydesdale Bank told us: “The issues raised have been investigated thoroughly and, while we sympathise with Mr Boyack, regrettably, given the circumstances, we could not provide a refund, and despite our efforts we were unable to retrieve the funds in question. The Financial Ombudsman also upheld our decision not to refund.” It adds that recycling account numbers is “common practice due to a limit on the amount of numbers available. In this case, the account number had not been used for eight years”. New safety measures A system is being introduced in the UK aimed at preventing people from sending payments to the wrong account, either by accident or as a result of a scam. But the bad news is that it isn’t due until 2018-2020. The “confirmation of payee” system will mean that when someone types in a sort code and account number to transfer some money, they will receive an instant message saying something like “Is ‘Joe Smith’ the person/business you intended to send the money to?” Crucially, this will appear before the money leaves the person’s account. Many people are unaware that currently the name of the person/company they are paying is effectively irrelevant as banks don’t do any cross-checking. As the proposals require a major systems change to enable banks to instantly identify recipients, it will be a couple of years before people see it. So what can they do now? As Clydesdale Bank says: “Always double-check the account details you are sending funds to, and check the recipient has received those funds.” Perhaps it is time to do an end-of-year spring clean of your list of payees and check that everyone’s bank details are up to date.",diasaster:0},

And I’m not apologising’ Read more Following up a platinum-selling debut is no easy task, but the 1975’s approach to their difficult second album was spectacularly cavalier. At the start of 2016, they released the elaborately titled I Like It When You Sleep, for You Are So Beautiful Yet So Unaware of It, an audacious record so stylised and wilfully eclectic that it was not unlike listening to a Now That’s What I Call Music! compilation from 1986. It could have been an act of commercial suicide but proved to be anything but. Instead the album rocketed to No 1 both here and in the States, and catapulted the 1975 to a rarefied altitude where they’e able to launch this UK tour with two sold-out nights at the O2. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Like a rag doll with a messiah complex … Healy. Photograph: Matthew Baker/Getty Images This success is all the more remarkable as the 1975’s musical default mode is a strain of intelligent yet scratchy, mildly funky electropop that can recall long-forgotten mid-80s pop outliers: Johnny Hates Jazz. Red Box. Belouis Some. It’s an impression confirmed early in tonight’s set as force-of-nature singer Matt Healy lounge-lizards across stage in a tuxedo, a glass of red wine in hand, to sing Ugh!, about his former cocaine habit. Yet the 1975 get away with these acts of aggressive magpie archeology because they write great, sharp-edged pop songs with nagging, irresistible hooks. Combined with stellar lighting, it makes this a hugely classy state-of-the-art arena show that charms even as you play spot the influences. Loving Someone has trace elements of Scritti Politti’s arch, sumptuous meta-pop; the thrumming synths and choked vocals of Somebody Else could be Tears for Fears, were they fronted by a rag doll with a messiah complex. The (very) occasional lulls have you idly wondering if they’re just Haircut 100 with A-levels, but then Healy launches into an erudite lament about Brexit, Trump and “people who are disenfranchised by political systems” before beseeching his fans to turn off their phones, just for one song, and live in the moment.

{ "title":"Dear Jeremy – your work problems solved", "content": "Someone I recruited has been promoted above me – what can I do about it? I am a salaried solicitor in my late 40s, employed by a medium-sized firm. I was recruited to build and run a department 10 years ago, and by 2010 we were a team of six. One of those I recruited, who is younger, indicated he wanted a managerial role, and three years later the firm decided to appoint him as team leader after I indicated I was fed up with managing (which involved much tedious administrative work), and he showed enthusiasm to step in. I was offered a small performance-related bonus as an incentive to generate fees. Three years on the firm has announced this employee has been made a salaried partner on the basis of his managerial contribution. I now feel overlooked and under-appreciated. Although I no longer have a managerial role, I generate twice as much income as the team leader, have been in the company twice as long, and am much older. It also feels more hurtful as I was involved in recruiting this person. I know I am seen as quiet and compliant, and it is true that I tend not to make a fuss. I am not looking for prestige, but I do like to feel wanted and appreciated. Instead, I feel rather humiliated, but it feels petty to complain.  I really like my job and get on well with the rest of my team (including the team leader). Also, the salary is OK. Should I swallow my pride and simply soldier on, or raise the issue ? Jeremy says I can fully understand your feelings. On one hand, you know you can hardly complain since you chose to renounce your managerial responsibilities some years ago; on the other, your company’s pay structure is clearly based more on job title than contribution, and that rankles. I suggest you write a very carefully considered note to your management. Don’t try to address the issue in person – it’s a bit too complicated and you might find yourself getting flustered.) Say that you don’t regret having given up your managerial role several years ago, because it has freed you to generate income and you believe that other able employees might also choose to follow this path if it was openly acknowledged by the firm to be an accepted option. But point out that, at the moment, promotion to a management function is the only public recognition a staff member can expect or strive for, which may encourage some to follow the management route even though they are temperamentally less suited. What you’re suggesting is the creation of a new title (perhaps no more than the addition of the word “senior” to an existing title) that publicly distinguishes those who make a significantly greater commercial contribution. Say you hope this would provide an additional incentive to those, such as yourself, who hope to progress not through ever-greater management responsibility but through ever-greater income generation. Make it absolutely clear that you just believe that such an addition to existing internal signs of recognition could be of considerable benefit. You stand a good chance of a favourable response. Readers say • Circumstances change in firms, so new recruits may get better deals. Often we carve out new roles (and enjoy doing so), and when we move on to new challenges others may benefit. You knew yourself well enough to choose quality of life over admin, which was brave. It sounds to me like there is more to you than your job. Enjoy life, and if your nose is rubbed in your colleague’s success then leave. It is a big world out there. jjal44 • You need to swallow your pride. I work for an investment bank and it is often difficult for younger people to lead senior members. Try to be professional and learn from that team member rather than complain. Fulhamred • I made this choice 10 years ago having been a manager for many years and became a full-time consultant. While it felt odd for a while, I am now appreciated for my experience and knowledge (I am 61), the amount of earnings I bring in, and my ability to mentor and train new employees. Markanthony2 How can I attract more customers as I try to build my Tefl business? I am a self-employed Tefl teacher in London. I set up my business in 2012 and have been working hard on my website and blog. I really enjoy what I do, but the problem is that I don’t get that many inquiries because my website isn’t in the first few pages of Google. I advertise through Gumtree but it’s £100 a week for a featured ad. I’ve tried Google adwords but it’s also very pricey. How can I advertise or get funding to build my business. Jeremy says You shouldn’t be looking to raise more money until you know what you plan to spend it on. As you’ve discovered, search engine optimisation (or SEO) can be an expensive business. There are outfits online that offer to give your website more prominence for relatively little outlay. I’ve no idea if they deliver and maybe you’ve tried them. If not, you might give them a cautious look. My own suggestion is far more primitive but certainly a lot cheaper, and is based on the fact you’re not looking for vast numbers of students. You will know better than I do the areas of London where foreign students tend to congregate. You’ll also know which nationalities they tend to be. I suggest you publicise your website – and your phone number – on good old-fashioned postcards displayed (for very little money) in newsagents and other shop windows in the most promising areas. Write in the languages of the students whose business you were hoping to attract. It will involve quite a bit of initial legwork, but you should find out within a month or so whether it’s working. Readers say • Word of mouth is always good, so encourage current students to recommend you to a friend – maybe offer a discount if they do (10% for bringing someone new in). Tippingpoi • On funding, there may be small grants from charities or local authorities if you can phrase your proposal along the lines of: this is for the community/to help integration/to support women who are blocked from independence/employment due to lack of English language skills etc. christinej • Tefl teachers tend to go overseas to teach English. Foreign students who come to England to learn English tend to go to language schools. I do have one suggestion, however, and that is to explore foreign companies in the UK which may want an English teacher to visit and give lessons. Heliopower Do you need advice on a work issue?

After fleeing Syria and travelling through 10 different countries he reached the UK at the end of July. Mustafa, 37, an agricultural engineer, was interviewed by the Guardian in August, a week after he arrived in the UK and first claimed asylum. His hazardous journey away from his family began in Lebanon, where his wife and their five young children moved to a modest apartment in Hassbia in the south. Once his family were safe and settled in their new accommodation, Mustafa embarked on his journey, determined to bring his loved ones over once he had settled in the UK and found work. I will never forget the screams of one of my daughters who was buried in the rubble Ali Mustafa He passed through Turkey, Greece, Macedonia, Serbia, Hungary, Austria, Germany, the Netherlands and France, where he spent 24 days in Calais. After dozens of unsuccessful attempts he finally managed to jump on to a train, hiding under a lorry with a few others and reaching the UK. “Jumping the train in Calais was no big deal compared with all the bombing we ran away from. Every day in Syria I used to look up to the sky and see birds and sunshine, fruits and vegetables growing out of the earth and sheep and camels walking on it. When the war started we looked up to the sky and saw only airstrikes and helicopters. When we looked down at the earth we saw only bombs lying on the ground. When the trouble started we fled from Dera to Raqqa. But our house in Raqqa was bombed. I will never forget the screams of one of my daughters who was buried in the rubble. We managed to dig her out and fortunately she survived,” Mustafa said. “As soon as the train started to go fast and enter the tunnel without us being found we knew we had made it,” he said. “We did a kind of hug with each other as best we could under the lorry because we were so happy. We had struggled so hard – but we had achieved.” 'We hugged under the lorry, we were so happy': migrants tell of journey to UK Read more Mustafa was first given temporary accommodation in London by the Home Office and was then moved to Stockton-on-Tees while his asylum claim was processed. He endured a period of enforced limbo as asylum seekers are not allowed to work and are not able to access many educational opportunities or any mainstream benefits. Fortunately for Mustafa he only had to wait a few months before being given permission to work, study and get on with his life. Syrian asylum claims are generally processed more quickly than others but many asylum seekers are trapped in the system for several years. “In my interview I told the Home Office that I don’t need any financial support from the UK. I can work. I just need help to feel safe. When the war finishes I want to return to Syria to help rebuild it. Syria is my country,” said Mustafa, adding: “The person who interviewed me from the Home Office was very nice.” Mustafa got a job working in a Lebanese restaurant in Newcastle as soon as he was granted leave to remain. “I started paying taxes to the UK the day I was granted refugee status,” he said. The plight of refugees is the crisis of our times | Katharine Viner Read more He has worked hard doing a variety of different jobs at the restaurant and has learned how to make proper Lebanese flat bread. He had one bad experience when a customer came into the restaurant soon after the Paris terror attacks and asked him where he was from. When he told her he was from Syria, she accused him of being an Islamic State terrorist. “I was very angry and upset about this. I am not part of Isis. They are one of the reasons why I ran away from Syria. I asked her to look into my eyes and see if she could see a terrorist there. She apologised after that. She hugged me and offered to help me in any way she could,” he said. Mustafa has now enrolled at Newcastle College and wants to improve his English. He hopes to obtain a similar agricultural engineering qualification here to the one he had in Syria so that he can use his skills and expertise in the UK. While Mustafa is happy to be in a safe country at last and is looking forward to being reunited with his family, he is very traumatised by what happened and continues to happen in Syria.

I get updates about what is happening in Syria all the time on Facebook. Too many friends have been killed.

There are so many factions and so much happening now that I no longer know where the beginning is and where is the end. My father is still trapped in Dera and my heart breaks for him.

{ "title":"Further flooding worsens troubles for Cumbrian towns hit by Storm Desmond", "content": "Householders and businesses in Cumbria have once again been hit by flooding, just days after having finished cleaning up after Storm Desmond. Thousands of people’s Christmas celebrations face disruption as the Environment Agency warned that the rain will continue to fall over the coming days. ‘Hammering, grim, brainless’ – how Storm Desmond hit Lancaster Read more Worst hit on Tuesday was the market town of Appleby-in-Westmorland, which was also the first to be affected when Desmond first struck on 5 December. The main bridge was closed and homes flooded for the second time in just over two weeks as the Eden river burst its banks again. The town’s mayor, Hughie Potts, said: “We just hope and pray it recedes soon. We really need help. It is just too much to be struck again like this. Someone needs to get a grip. The obvious solution is to dig a deeper channel.” Potts spoke as 45cm (18in) of water filled his home in The Sands. “Outside it is 2ft 6in and rising,” he said as he ushered his family fromtheir home. He had moved upstairs in his terrace house after Desmond and installed dehumidifiers in the ground floor. “They’ll have to be moved now or they’ll be washed away,” he added. Elsewhere in Appleby, a town of 2,000, a pop-up Co-operative store had to be moved from the bowling green, which was swamped, to avoid it floating down the river. Prince Charles: Storm Desmond floods highlight need to tackle climate change Read more The flooding of the Eden river could also impact Carlisle, which lies further downstream and is usually affected by flooding about 12 hours after Appleby. The city, visited by Prince Charles this week, had more than 3,000 families made homeless during Desmond. For the third time this month the Glenridding hotel, by Ullswater, was inundated by the local beck. The hotel reported on Facebook that the beck is overflowing once again past the bridge and what was Ratchers Bar and the Kitchen were flooding again. Contractors are working to save their equipment, said the hotel. The Environment Agency had issued 24 flood warnings across England and Wales by early evening on Tuesday: five of them in the north-east and12 in the north-west and three in Wales. These are one step below the most severe category, which warns of risk to life, but still indicates immediate action is required. Already thousands of families face Christmas out of their homes. An Environment Agency spokesman said on Tuesday: “Rain falling last night and today has led to a rise in some river levels in Cumbria. This will continue throughout the day. Storm Eva and flooding in the UK: how have you been affected? Read more “The amount of rainfall forecast would not usually lead to disruption, but with saturated ground and river levels already high, there may be further flood impacts to roads and potentially to some properties. “Our operational activity is ongoing with teams taking action to reduce the potential impacts of flooding and supporting those communities affected. Environment Agency staff are on the ground ready to help residents in the event of flooding. “Persistent rainfall in Wales could also see parts of Herefordshire and Shropshire experience isolated flooding impacts from the River Wye and River Severn. “There is currently the possibility for further unsettled weather during the festive period which could lead to some disruption in the north of England. We are monitoring the situation closely and will issue further flood alerts and warnings if required. The rivers Eden, Greta and Kent and their tributaries were full to the brim and fields became waterlogged after another belt of heavy rain crossed the region. Appleby, Carlisle, Keswick and Kendal are likely to be the worst-hit. Storm Desmond has already left 6,000 families in those towns homeless, putting pressure on welfare organisations and housing stocks. Cumbria police said: “A multi-agency response group has been set up in order to combat an extended spell of consistent rainfall which is currently falling across the county. Flood warnings have been issued for Appleby, Carlisle, Kendal and Keswick. There are also 11 flood warnings and 14 flood alerts for all river catchments in Cumbria. “Whilst the rainfall is not likely to be near the amount that fell during Storm Desmond, it will be falling on already saturated ground and is likely to cause surface-water flooding on roads across the county. “Due to the potentially high winds and wet conditions advice issued to drivers is to slow down, plan extra time for your journey and to make sure that your car is equipped to deal with deteriorating weather conditions.” Facebook Twitter Pinterest Cumbria surveys damage after Storm Desmond flooding earlier this month",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Sale of Camden Town Brewery a sign of craft beer’s fizzing into the mainstream", "content": "Camden Town Brewery, Goose Island, Lagunitas IPA, Meantime and Blue Moon have two things in common – not only are they widely perceived as “craft beers”, they are also owned by sprawling multinationals. This week’s announcement by Camden Town that it has succumbed to a takeover by AB InBev, the world’s largest brewer, brought home this gap between branding and reality. Drinkers took to social media to admonish Camden Town’s founder, Jasper Cuppaidge, for selling out – at a price thought to be £85m. Rival BrewDog, the self-styled “punk” brewer that prides itself on flying the banner for the craft beer ethos, went even further. The company released a scathing video on social media, showing Camden Hells beer being ceremonially removed from the menu in one of its bars. Facebook Twitter Pinterest BrewDog’s video showing Camden Hells being removed from a drinks menu.. BrewDog dished out the same treatment to London brewer Meantime after it was snapped up by SABMiller earlier this year. Clearly the purists are concerned that – to paraphrase Gil Scott-Heron’s famous lyric – their nascent revolution has been televised. The genesis of craft beer’s journey into the mainstream in Britain was the introduction by Gordon Brown, as chancellor, of Small Brewers’ Relief in 2002. The policy slashed excise duty for brewers making less than 60,000 hectolitres (10.56m pints) a year. It works on a sliding scale, giving a bigger tax break to smaller scale businesses. It encouraged hundreds of willing amateurs to transform their own combinations of water, hops, yeast and malted barley into money-making enterprises. Where there were only a few hundred craft brewers 20 years ago, the Society of Independent Brewers (SIBA) now estimates that Britain boasts more than 1,500, with a market share of about 7% and growing. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Hells Lager move along the production line inside Camden Town’s brewery. Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty Images These include critically acclaimed London brewhouses such as Partizan and The Kernel, who throw open their doors on what is becoming known as the Bermondsey beer mile every Saturday. Further north, Manchester’s Cloudwater and Northern Monk from Leeds – as well as a phalanx of Yorkshire brewhouses – have also made names for themselves. Inevitably, the success of small players has alerted the likes of AB InBev and SABMiller, which will form one company producing more than 500m hectolitres a year once their £71bn tie-up is finalised. But SIBA’s managing director, Mike Benner, says that takeovers by brewing multinationals do not necessarily mean the craft beer revolution has been hijacked by the money men. “What we’re looking at is a success story,” he said. “The very fact that global brewers are getting in on the craft beer scene demonstrates they can see that consumers want more diversity, higher quality and a range of different flavours for different occasions.” Facebook Twitter Pinterest A bottle of Punk IPA by Brewdog. Photograph: Andrew Matthews/PA Increased diversity at the taps has also widened the love of good-quality beer beyond real ale aficionados, who frown upon anything not kept in wooden casks. Quality beers are now being produced in kegs, bottles and even cans, helping craft brewers offset the rapid decline of high street pubs. “Increasingly we’re seeing craft-brewed beers in the hospitality environment, casual dining and so on,” said Benner. “The link between quality beer and dining is here to stay.” It is not just domestic success that has attracted the big names though. Craft beer has gone global in recent years, with brewhouses opening up in all sorts of unexpected places. Whether it’s Great Leap Brewing in Beijing, Yasigi in Kampala, Uganda, or the Louisiane Brewhouse in Nha Trang, Vietnam, good quality beers have global appeal. That means big rewards for brewers that can find ways to tap into those fast-growing markets. The possibility of international expansion was one reason Cuppaidge gave for his decision to sell Camden Town Brewery. But even if small brewers are willing to swap their neighbourhood charm for global domination, drinkers do not have to be slaves to the multinationals. Shifting tastes have given rise to businesses that do more than just manufacture, such as London-based U Brew. This company allows customers to brew their own beer on its premises, rather than having to find space for the equipment at home. Thus the ultimate hipster badge of honour – a brew so exclusive it has your own name on it – is within reach. If that sounds like too much effort, drinkers can also plump for Honest Brew, a company that delivers a variety of bottles direct to the door, depending on customers’ tastes. The growth of the quality beer industry means that while major brewers are getting their claws into the action, there is still space for smaller companies to benefit from the growing thirst for originality. And for those who would rather have a dry Christmas than put money into the pockets of AB InBev and SABMiller, that choice will still be there. “Consumers now want beer with a story to tell, local beers that mean something to them,” said Benner. “There will always be a market place for genuine, locally brewed, high-quality beer.”",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"AirAsia flight QZ8501: details emerge of passengers on missing plane", "content": "There were vacationers and scholarship students, businessmen and missionaries, sons and daughters, husbands and wives. On Sunday morning, the only thing that connected them was a ticket on AirAsia flight QZ8501, a two-hour red-eye haul from the Indonesian city of Surabaya to Singapore. They would have been expecting to walk into the gleaming city state’s humid air in no time and get on with their lives. The fate of the flight’s 155 passengers and seven crew members is now uncertain: at 6.17am, about 40 minutes after takeoff, the flight vanished from radars over the Java Sea. No signs of the plane have been found, despite an elaborate international search and rescue operation. The hope of finding survivors is fading. In the meantime, a diverse portrait of those onboard has begun to emerge. The vast majority of passengers were Indonesian; there were also three South Koreans, one Malaysian, a French co-pilot, one Briton and one Singaporean. Among the crew were two pilots, four flight attendants and one engineer. The passengers included 16 children and an infant. Friends and family members have gathered in cordoned-off zones at Singapore’s Changi airport and Surabaya’s Juanda international airport to await briefings. At Changi on Monday afternoon, a young woman made her way up to a cordon around the relatives’ holding area and put a small square board covered in Post-It notes on the ground. Each Post-It held a message of hope and prayer for those within. “We feel your terrible sadness and pain,” said one note. “The rest of the world gives you a very big hug at this time.” Many family members are preparing for the worst. “I knew about this incident from watching TV and tried to get more information from my family,” Oei Endang Sulsilowati, whose brother Oei Jimmy Sentosa Winata was on the plane with his wife and two children, told CNN. “We don’t know what to do. We are just waiting for news.” The British passenger, 48-year-old Chi-Man Choi, was travelling home with his two year-old Singaporean daughter, Zoe; they sat in the flight’s first row, in seats 1B and 1C. Choi graduated from Essex University and worked for the French multinational company Alstom Power, according to his LinkedIn profile. He had originally planned to fly to Singapore earlier, with Zoe’s five year-old brother Luca and mother Wee Mei-Yi, and booked the seats on QZ8501 when he could not get other tickets. Choi’s brother Choi Chi-Wai, 46, told the Guardian that he would fly to Singapore in the next few days to support his sister-in-law and the rest of the family. “There’s been no news officially, but I guess you would kind of hope there’d be more information,” he said. “But obviously we are concerned and we are prepared for the worst. We also try not to speculate.” According to Singapore’s Straits Times newspaper, the three South Koreans on board – Park Seong Beom, his wife, Lee Kyung Hwa, and their 11-month-old daughter Park Yu Na – were a family of Christian missionaries travelling to Singapore to renew their visas for another year in Indonesia. The family was from Yeosu, a city on South Korea’s southern coast, the Straits Times reported, citing South Korean media. Park was a theology graduate and was dispatched to Indonesia three years ago. Another passenger was reported to be Nico Giovanni, an 18-year-old Indonesian national who had recently finished his first year at Singapore’s St Andrew’s Junior College on a scholarship from the Singaporean education ministry. He was travelling with his family, according to the Straits Times. “Nico is very reserved,” a friend named Michael told the newspaper. “He is hard-working and respectful.” Florentina Maria Widodo, a 26-year-old biology teacher at Singapore’s Hwa Chong Institution, was also on the plane, according to the Straits Times. Her Singaporean boyfriend Andy Paul Chen confirmed that she was on the flight, and said he was travelling to Surabaya to be with her family.",diasaster:0},

{ "title":"Greece at distinct disadvantage if incoming leaders look to exit eurozone", "content": "The bookies have cut the odds on a Greek exit from the eurozone to evens now that elections look likely to bring a leftist party to power with a mandate to wage war with Brussels. The betting is that the Syriza party leaders who are poised to dominate the post-election parliament will discover Athens no longer has the bargaining power it once held. Four years ago Greece was like the proverbial mouse to Europe’s elephant: tiny by comparison but with the capacity to frighten and destabilise. Today the eurozone, while still the lumbering giant, has acquired a shrewdness that puts Greece at a distinct disadvantage. Brussels has managed to put a firebreak between it and the potential austerity rebels. Syriza argues that the right-of-centre coalition’s determination to force through enough cuts to generate annual budget surpluses and thereby repay debt to Brussels, the International Monetary Fund and private lenders is a recipe for endless austerity and poverty. Greater forgiveness should be forthcoming from Brussels, allowing those debts to be repaid over a longer period. However, eurozone leaders have spent much of the last couple of years shoring up the finances of the other crisis-hit countries, Ireland and Portugal, and binding those nations that came close to collapse, especially Spain, closer to Brussels’ bosom. Eurozone bailout funds and infrastructure funds are often described as inadequate for the job of spurring growth, but are sufficient to maintain the currency zone’s stability. It was a different situation in 2010 when the threat of a Greek exit first spooked international investors. Back then the world’s dominant fund managers saw a void at the centre of the eurozone. Worse, they believed a vote by any country large or small to pull out would spell the euro’s demise. Now, investors believe their money is secure. Stock markets and debt markets, which freaked out in 2010, have discounted a Grexit in their forecasts for the coming year. It would have consequences, just not the seismic ones they once feared. So without the shock value in this game of brinkmanship, Athens is the only loser. Worse for Greece, many of the suits in Brussels believe that for all the bleating, it is a wealthy country that only need embark on some redistribution of its own to solve much of its poverty. The hardened eurocrat thinks Greece, like troubled Italy and Spain, could deal with much of its poverty with crackdowns on obvious corruption and a burgeoning hidden economy. With this in mind, demands for debt forgiveness from Syriza will be met with smiles and a firm no. From Berlin to Helsinki, there is little support for the voters of Greece. • This article was amended on 30 December 2014. An earlier version said there was little support for the voters of Greece from “Berlin to Oslo”. This has been corrected to “Berlin to Helsinki”.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Alexei Navalny fraud trial verdict brought forward", "content": "The verdict in the fraud trial of the anti-Kremlin activist Alexei Navalny will be announced on Tuesday. The decision of a Moscow court has been brought forward suddenly after thousands of his supporters pledged to take to the streets on the original date, 15 January. “The announcement of the verdict will take place on December 30 at 9am,” Navalny wrote on his blog. It may take more than a day to deliver the verdict. His lawyers said the move appeared to be unprecedented. “I am not aware of a single case when the announcement of a verdict was brought forward,” said Navalny’s lawyer Olga Mikhailova. Navalny and his team said the move was apparently intended to thwart his supporters who pledged to turn up on Manezhnaya Square near the Kremlin walls on 15 January. “There are no exceptions that cannot be arranged for good people,” Navalny wrote. Along with his brother Oleg, Navalny is accused of defrauding the French cosmetics company Yves Rocher of nearly 27m roubles, then worth more than £320,000, but the company has said it suffered no damages by working with the Navalny brothers. Navalny, who rose to prominence during the anti-Kremlin protests staged in 2011-12, faced a five-year prison sentence last year over alleged embezzlement but walked away with a suspended sentence. Authorities had warned that the Kremlin crackdown on Navalny could backfire amid mounting economic problems. Some said the January rally threatened to become the biggest demonstration against president Vladimir Putin’s rule since the beginning of Moscow’s confrontation with the west over Ukraine last year. The decision to expedite the verdict is reminiscent of the end of 2010 when a judge raced against time to wrap up a second trial of the Kremlin critic Mikhail Khodorkovsky. On 30 December 2010, Khodorkovsky was sentenced to a second term in prison over theft and money laundering. Last December, Putin pardoned Khodorkovsky after a decade in prison. Prosecutors last week called for Navalny to be sentenced to 10 years in prison.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"City Link private equity firm hopes to recover £20m despite job losses", "content": "The private equity firm behind City Link expects to recover £20m from the collapsed parcel carrier as it was confirmed thousands of employees would lose their job on New Year’s Eve. Although no redundancies were announced formally on Monday, administrators at Ernst & Young (EY) said they had briefed staff at City Link’s depots around the country that a “substantial” round of cuts would take place on 31 December. The company, which employs 2,727 staff as well as 1,000 self-employed drivers and agency workers, has stopped taking parcels but has opened its warehouses in order to allow customers to retrieve their parcels. Some staff will be retained into the new year to handle the 40,000 parcels still in its possession, EY said. The Coventry-based firm has three additional transport hubs – in West Drayton, Peterborough and Warrington – as well as 53 smaller depots throughout the UK. City Link’s owner Better Capital, which is run by veteran private equity investor John Moulton, told its shareholders on Monday that it expected to recoup around half the £40m it had ploughed into the troubled business it bought for £1 in 2013. In the autumn Better Capital wrote down the value of its investment in City Link to £20m – a figure based on how much it would recover if the business was liquidated. It stood by that figure in a statement issued to the stock exchange. Better Capital’s admission that it would recover some of its funds caused anger as EY confirmed staff would need to lodge their claims with the government-backed redundancy payments service. It is unlikely that the large number of self-employed or agency workers that City Link relied on will receive any compensation as the statutory scheme does not cover payments due to self-employed contractors. City analysts were less optimistic that Better Capital would recover its £20m as its shares fell 2.5% on Monday, suggesting investors believe its losses could be greater. Because it invested in City Link through a series of loans, Better Capital is classed as a secured creditor and is therefore at the front of the queue for recompense, ahead of staff and suppliers. The majority of the company’s properties and vans are thought to be leased, with funds raised expected to come from the sale of machinery and other plant to rival operators. The demise of City Link was deemed good news for Royal Mail with its shares gaining more than 4% to make it the biggest riser in the FTSE 100 on Monday. “We would like to be more conservative than this [£20m figure] with the expectation of a significant number of claims on the remaining assets of City Link,” said Liberium analyst, Rob Jones, who added that thought the administration could be “more lengthy and thus more costly than originally anticipated”. Administrators at EY were formally appointed on Christmas Eve, with many workers learning about their employers’ financial problems on Christmas Day. The RMT union has urged the business secretary, Vince Cable, to rescue the company but Moulton said the Department for Business was aware of City Link’s collapse before Christmas and did not request a meeting to discuss its future. It had proved impossible to save City Link, he said, stressing that the company’s directors would have been guilty of a criminal offence had they not filed for insolvency when it became clear “a couple of days before Christmas” that the firm would collapse. He estimated the company needed an injection of about £100m to turn it around. “We are very sorry about the failure of City Link and we’re very sorry about the horrible effects that follow for the workforce and contractors,” said Moulton in response to claims the business had been mismanaged. “I’m afraid that is the result of the company failing, nothing more and nothing less. The company was not viable.”",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Search for missing AirAsia flight to expand", "content": "The huge international search for missing AirAsia QZ8501 is set to expand on Tuesday with France, Australia, Malaysia, Singapore and China all sending ships and aircraft to join the operation off the Indonesian coast. At least 15 ships, seven planes and four helicopters searched on Monday for any signs of the Airbus A320-200, which vanished from radar screens on Sunday morning with 162 people on board as it approached violent weather about 40 minutes into a two-hour flight between Surabaya in east Java, Indonesia and Singapore. An Indonesian search and rescue official said the plane was presumed to be “at the bottom of the sea”. No wreckage has been found. Weather has impeded the search, with rough waves decreasing visibility on the water and intermittent rain clouds obscuring the waves from above. The airliner, operated by an Indonesian subsidiary of the Malaysian budget airline AirAsia, reportedly requested permission to increase altitude from 32,000ft (9,750 metres) to 38,000ft to avoid bad weather. The request was not immediately granted because of other aircraft in the area and the plane lost contact with Jakarta air traffic control five minutes later. It did not send a distress signal. On board were seven crew members and 155 passengers, including 16 children and one infant. The vast majority on board were Indonesian, the co-pilot was French, and the passengers included three South Koreans, a Malaysian and a British man with his two-year-old Singaporean daughter. Named in reports as Chi-Man Choi, the energy industry executive was understood to have boarded the flight at the last minute with his daughter Zoe. His brother Chi-Wai Choi, a 46-year-old optometrist from Alsager, Cheshire, said he was “prepared for the worst”. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Indonesia resumes a sea and aerial search at dawn on Monday for the AirAsia plane that went missing in the Java Sea with 162 people on board. More vessels and planes were expected to join the hunt on Tuesday as four more areas were added to the seven searched so far across the large but relatively shallow sea. Officials have asked the UK, US and France for sonar technology and underwater search assistance. Indonesia’s request for help from the US was conveyed on Monday via diplomatic note to the American embassy in Jakarta, said US state department spokesman Jeff Rathke, although he said it was too soon to say what form any assistance might take. “We are reviewing that request to find out how best we can assist,” he said. A US navy fleet off the coast of Japan said it stood ready to assist if requested. In a statement on its website, China’s defence ministry said it had sent a warship to the South China Sea and planes had begun preparatory work for search operations. Bambang Soelistyo, Indonesia’s national search and rescue agency chief, said: “Based on the co-ordinates given to us and evaluation that the estimated crash position is in the sea, the hypothesis is the plane is at the bottom of the sea. That’s the preliminary suspicion and it can develop based on the evaluation of the result of our search.” He added that “the capability of our equipment is not optimum”, and Indonesia would consult countries including the UK, France and the US about technology that might be required to retrieve the plane from the seabed. Aerial surveys on Monday located two oily patches off Indonesia’s coast. It is not known if they are related to the missing jet. Indonesian air force spokesman Hadi Tjahjanto said searchers were checking a report of an oil slick off Belitung, an area with heavy traffic. They had picked up an emergency locator signal off the south of Borneo but no subsequent signal was found, he said. Oil samples would be collected and analysed, said Tjahjanto, to see if they had come from a ship or the plane. Other objects spotted in the water, about 700 miles from the point of last contact, are not believed to be connected to the flight. The AirAsia chief executive Tony Fernandes tweeted on Monday: “My heart bleeds for all the relatives of my crew and our passengers. Nothing is more important to us.” The Indonesian president, Joko Widodo, ordered an immediate review of all aviation procedures and vowed to find the flight no matter how long a search operation was required. He told a press conference he was shocked to hear about the flight’s disappearance. “I could feel the concern, the frustration and the sadness experienced by the passengers’ families, and I believe also felt by all the people of Indonesia,” he said. Anger was growing among relatives of the missing who were gathered at a crisis centre in Surabaya. “We’ve been here for two days but the information is unclear,” Franky Chandra, who has a sibling and three friends among the passengers, told Reuters news agency. The search, which includes local fishermen, is focused on an area of 70 square nautical miles between the island of Belitung, off Sumatra, and Borneo island. The sea in the search area is between 50 and 100 metres deep. The pilot, Iryanto, who like many Indonesians goes by one name, had logged more than 20,000 flying hours, a significant number. Online discussions among pilots centred on unconfirmed secondary radar data from Malaysia that suggested the missing plane was climbing at a speed of 353 knots, about 100 knots too slow in such weather conditions. “At that altitude, that speed is exceedingly dangerous,” the Sydney-based aviation expert Geoff Thomas told Reuters. “At that altitude, the thin air, the wings won’t support the aircraft at that speed and you get an aerodynamic stall.”",diasaster:0},

The long hours during which the ferry was adrift and ablaze in the Adriatic brought out heroism and baseness alike: at one extreme, the Italian and Greek helicopter rescue crews who worked through the night battling winds gusting up to 40 knots (46mph); at the other, men alleged to have barged ahead of – and in some cases assaulted – women in an effort to be rescued first. Some of those saved from the ship gave vivid accounts of the terror and misery aboard. Nick Channing-Williams, 37, a British show-jumper who trains young riders in Greece, said he wondered at times whether he and his Greek fiancee, Regina Theoffili, would come through the ordeal alive. Theoffili told the Guardian she heard a bang early in the morning on Sunday, but did not think much of it until the ship started to smell of burning. Then there was an alarm. On the car deck, a fire that would cripple the Norman Atlantic was fast raging out of control. “We ran upstairs, leaving everything behind us, thinking we could return, but then we saw the fire was so big, we could see the flames. We could only stand on the deck and became soaking wet,” she said. “The flames were huge and the cars were on fire,” Channing-Williams told Sky News. “It was so hot we could only stand in the rain.” Many in Italy were keen to see in the ferry’s Italian captain, Argilio Giacomazzi, the last man to leave his ship, the hero of the hour. Social media were alive with comparisons between the shaven-headed 62-year-old skipper and Francesco Schettino, captain of the Costa Concordia, the liner that wrecked off the island of Giglio almost three years ago, who left his ship long before the evacuation was completed and is now on trial for multiple manslaughter. Prosecutors will nevertheless want answers over claims by several passengers that the alarm was given too late, and that the crew were unprepared for an emergency. Christos Perlis, a 32-year-old Greek lorry driver, told the Associated Press that the alarm sounded when most of the passengers had been driven from their cabins by smoke. He said there were no crew members in sight to direct passengers. Investigators will also be seeking to find out why so few liferafts were launched from the Norman Atlantic. Speaking from hospital in Brindisi, a Turkish passenger, Aylin Akamac, told the news agency Anadolu that only three were available. Regina Theoffili said that as the day wore on “there were little boats which came round to help us, but the weather was so bad they could not approach. Nobody could do anything.”Channing-Williams, who was pictured on TV covered in soot and grease, described how he and other passengers tried to tie a tow rope from tugboats on to the front of the ferry but gave up after failing for a third time. As the 26,900-tonne Norman Atlantic drifted towards the Albanian coast, nudged by south-westerly winds, the rescue services in Italy and Greece decided they had no option but to order helicopter sorties to take the passengers off in pairs. Antonio Laneve, a 44-year-old pilot, said: “In 20 years of flying I have never seen anything like it. The ship was enveloped in flamesThey were almost everywhere.” He told the Italian daily Corriere della Sera that at first people were more frightened of being winched into a helicopter than of staying aboard the ferry. But as night fell, misgivings turned to panic. Christos Perlis said he and another man tried to impose order. “First children, then women and then men,” he said. “But the men, they started hitting us so they could get on first.” His account was borne out by Dimitra Theodossiou, a Greek soprano who had been on her way to Rimini for a production of Verdi’s opera Nabucco. She said some of the men had been put below to give precedence to women and children. “But they climbed up and punched and tugged and pulled you out of the way, elbowing their way to safety. It was very ugly. I shall never forget it.”Major Lanete described a scene when a mother reached his helicopter with a baby in her arms and told them: “There are still two of my children aboard. They too are little. I beg you. Go back and take them.” But, he said, “the helicopter has its limits. We couldn’t load it any more.”",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Football governance needs new independent review", "content": "“Without government support, a shakeup of football’s archaic regulatory structure will achieve nothing,” you say (Editorial, 13 December). That is why in 2004 Lord Burns was asked to review the governance of football jointly by the government and the FA. This government-initiated independent review resulted, contrary to press speculation, in the FA accepting the Burns report recommendations, ie appointment of an independent chair; creation of a new board with two non-executives; establishing a new regulation and compliance unit to carry out the enforcement of the FA; creation of two new subsidiaries – the Community Football Alliance and the Professional Football Alliance; and expanding the current FA Council into a “parliament of football”, which will include players, managers, referees and supporters. As the sports minister in October 2006, I welcomed the FA Council’s acceptance of the Burns recommendations as “a step in the right direction”, but fully acknowledging that more would need to be done. So it’s unfortunate that the three past independent chairs of the FA have chosen to write to the select committee, after leaving the job, calling for government intervention rather than to have initiated a further review with government support to build on the modernisation changes that brought them into office. The present government proposal to modernise the governance of sport, including the FA and making compliance dependant on government funding, is welcomed. But it is true that even these reforms may not be adequate to address the power of the Premier League, which is the main point of the past chairmen’s letter to the select committee, a power in football which has successfully grown financially four-fold in the 12 years since Burns. I would suggest these concerns and others in football should be addressed by an independent review similar to the one led by Lord Burns. In my experience sport is better self-regulated with government support rather than by government-imposed regulation.

{ "title":"Murdoch at the centre of power again as Cameron drops round for drinks", "content": "He once admitted to using Downing Street’s back door to celebrate the prime minister’s electoral victory, but on Monday night Rupert Murdoch was expected to welcome David Cameron through the front door of his home to a Christmas soiree for just a “few dozen” friends. Four years after the phone hacking scandal, which rocked the media and political establishment, Cameron’s appearance at the party is understood to be his first meeting with Murdoch since his re-election in May. Proof that the head of News Corp is back at the centre of power in the UK. The event at Murdoch’s London flat in St James’s is also set to reunite Cameron with Rebekah Brooks after the News UK chief executive was cleared of all phone hacking charges and three months after she returned to her old job, running Murdoch’s newspapers in the UK. Sir Martin Sorrell, the chief executive of ad group WPP, said of the media mogul, recently divorced and now 84: “He certainly hasn’t been diminished. If anything, he has more vim and vigour than ever. He is just as powerful a figure and in the future will be even more so.” Since his re-election in May, Cameron has met the editors of Murdoch’s papers, the Times and the Sun, and has visited parties given by other media moguls – Lord Rothermere, the owner of the Daily Mail, and Evgeny Lebedev, whose father owns the Evening Standard and Independent titles. Downing Street did not return calls asking for comment on Cameron’s evening plans but his expected appearance was confirmed by News Corp insiders: a decision to return to the Murdoch inner sanctum that is all the more remarkable given the embarrassment his proximity to the Murdoch empire caused him at the height of the hacking scandal. Full details of the last Christmas party Cameron attended at the Oxfordshire home of Brooks in 2010 only emerged at the Leveson inquiry 18 months later, when the prime minister admitted to “briefly” discussing the company’s bid for the satellite broadcaster Sky as well as his frequent “country suppers” with Brooks and her husband. One senior Labour party source who had been involved in the hacking inquiry said of Cameron’s appearance at the drinks party: “This is the PM embracing him with open arms, celebrating his victory.” While some Murdoch associates credit his renewed vigour to the 84-year-old’s new relationship with the former model Jerry Hall, who will also attend the drinks party, the chief reason appears to be a sort of corporate annus mirabilis for Murdoch. At the start of 2015, the head of the company that controls more than a third of British newspaper assets, as well as 40% of Sky, still faced the possibility of corporate charges on both sides of the Atlantic, while many of his employees faced criminal charges for paying public officials. While nine journalists were convicted over hacking, none where convicted over corrupt payments to public officials, and Murdoch has seen corporate charges dropped on both sides of the Atlantic. He has also put Brooks back in charge of his British newspapers despite initial reports in the Guardian being met with disbelief. Having returned to the top job in September, Brooks did not go to any of the main political party conferences and is only now ready to get “reacquainted” with people, according to company insiders. After splitting the two arms of his media empire into a film/television and publishing businesses, ostensibly to prevent the phone hacking scandal tarnishing his more lucrative 21st Century Fox franchise, Murdoch has watched as both companies have grown in value on the stock exchange. He has also elevated both of his sons, Lachlan and James, into the top jobs at each company over the past year. Even the decision to close the 168-year-old News of the World has resulted in a far cheaper seven-day operation for the Sun, which, though facing an advertising and circulation decline, is still the UK’s biggest selling tabloid. He may have spent $500m (£336m) on settling hacking claims, closed a national newspaper and lost several of his staff but, after four years, Rupert Murdoch appears to have emerged a winner. He is rumoured to be considering a returned offer for the whole of Sky he does not own but his interest in Time Warner, the US media giant behind the Harry Potter films and the CNN news network, suggests he may now have far bigger fish to fry. For some, Cameron still has questions to ask, of course. The government has indicated that it will not officially axe plans for a Leveson part 2 on police corruption until all criminal cases are complete. With phone hacking victims lodging an appeal last week, the cases may drag on. Evan Harris, executive director of campaign group Hacked Off, said that Cameron has yet to implement Leveson’s “modest recommendations” about disclosing the details of his meetings with media executives despite telling the Leveson inquiry “that the relationship between ministers and editors/proprietors was too close for the good of the country”. “Until he does so,” he added, “his relationship with the house of Murdoch will continue to reek of sleaze.” With the upper echelons of the Conservative party – George Osborne and Michael Gove as well as Cameron – all more vocal supporters of the Murdochs than the current leadership of the Labour party or Liberal Democrats, Murdoch’s views on Europe, press regulation and more besides is expected to be listened to more intently than it was during the years of the coalition. Later this week, Murdoch is also due to attend what is believed to be his first British pantomime alongside Hall, who starred in last year’s production at Richmond Theatre. When told “he’s behind you”, Murdoch could be forgiven for thinking that the traditional phrase could be used to describe the prime minister’s relationship to him.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Make up for benefit cuts by working 200 more hours, government says", "content": "The Department for Work and Pensions has admitted that people will see cash losses to their in-work benefits under the new universal credit system and suggested they could make up for it by working an extra 200 hours a year. In a new document on universal credit, published after parliament has broken up for Christmas, the department said people could “recoup the loss” caused by lower in-work benefits from April 2016 by taking on an extra three or four hours of work a week at the new “national living wage” of £7.20 an hour. Iain Duncan Smith, the work and pensions secretary, has repeatedly insisted that people on universal credit will not be worse off because of changes to in-work benefits announced at the summer budget. He told parliament: “Those who are on universal credit at present will be fully supported through the flexible support fund, which will provide all the resources necessary to ensure that their situation remains exactly the same as it is today.” But the government response to its independent advisers on the Social Security Advisory Committee (pdf) admits people are due to see losses from April. It said: “We expect many claimants to respond to the changes to work allowances announced in the summer budget by actively seeking more work, and we will support them with this. For example, someone could recoup the loss from the work allowance changes by working three to four additional hours a week at the national living wage to which they are entitled.” Owen Smith, the shadow work and pensions secretary, highlighted the difficulty of getting extra hours of work for many people. “Working families set to lose thousands of pound next year because of cuts to universal credit will be livid at the Tories’ offhand suggestion that they just work more hours,” he said. “It’s the measure of Iain Duncan Smith that he is trying to shift the blame for the cuts on to the victims. His Christmas message is work an extra 200 hours a year and you’ll be no worse off. “A single mother working full-time with two children is set to be up to £3,000 worse off as a result of the cuts, while 2.6 million working families stand to lose an average of £1,600.” An extra four hours a week at the new minimum wage of £7.20 an hour would make someone another £1,500 a year. Universal credit has come under scrutiny since George Osborne, the chancellor, cancelled his billions of pounds of cuts to tax credits under political pressure from Labour and some of his own Conservative MPs. The new universal credit system – which rolls six benefits into one monthly payment and replaces tax credits with work allowances – will come into force gradually over the next five to six years. Labour has previously claimed the tax credit cuts are merely being delayed rather than cancelled because it says government figures show it is intending to cut £100m from the universal credit work allowance next year, £1.2bn the year after that, and then £2.2bn, £2.9bn and £3.2bn by 2020. People who currently claim tax credits will be transferred to universal credit without any cash losses, but they will get the lower work allowance rate when their circumstances change. New claimants will be also put on the new lower rate from April, and those who are already on universal credit will see their work allowance entitlements fall at that point. Around 500,000 will be on universal credit by April but it is not known how many of those claim the work allowance. A DWP spokesman said: “Universal credit is at the heart of our welfare revolution. It ensures work always pays, and supports people to progress. And it is working – under the new system people are significantly more likely to be in work, and earn more than under the old system.”",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"The Guardian view on snap elections in Greece", "content": "The election that the Greek prime minister, Antonis Samaras, has called after losing his gamble over the presidency on Monday represents the start of an even more uncertain era in Europe. The political forces set in motion by austerity policies designed to cope with the still unresolved economic crisis are coming to the fore everywhere, undermining established parties, changing the way countries are governed, and reshaping popular attitudes. New parties, as well as older but previously marginal ones, have grown apace. Some are getting closer to power, or at least to a share in it. If Syriza, the Greek radical leftist party, wins the elections scheduled for 25 January – and its chances of doing so are deemed to be good – it will have achieved such power, even if it has to rule in coalition. It will perhaps go down as the first true anti-austerity, as well as unashamedly anti-capitalist, party to come to office in Europe after 2008 changed the rules of the game. It might well set a precedent for other new parties, notably Podemos in Spain, which has burst from nowhere to become a serious rival to the ruling People’s party and the opposition Socialists. The question a Syriza victory could raise is whether a specifically anti-austerity party in a small country can force a change in an economic strategy for the whole eurozone that has been largely crafted by Germany, and which that nation has until now shown little readiness to change. Until now, the European austerity regime has been administered by mainstream parties, such as the Socialists in France, even though they have argued with Berlin and Brussels over the degree and extent of such policies. Greece is a small country which had been storing up, and hiding, its economic problems for years before the larger global crisis tipped it over the edge, or would have done had the European Union not intervened. Since then it has been on life support by way of repeated injections of European money, but it has also had the life drained out of its society by the policies it has been forced to implement. Every Greek government since has had to try to square this dismal circle. The Samaras administration had been under intense pressure in recent negotiations over what support Europe would offer after the current bailout ends in February and what fresh cuts and economies it could give in return. Mr Samaras, uncertain whether he could sustain another austerity round if he left things as they were, chose the risky course of turning the choice of a new president into what was in effect a vote of confidence that would have strengthened his fragile two-party coalition, had he won it. He lost it in part because Europe pushed too hard, and Europe must now face the consequences. It is still conceivable that he and his allies could win the election. But whatever government emerges, the immediate question will be, as before, what deal can be made between Greece and Europe on economic support. The context, however, will be different, first because Greece will by then be very close to completely running out of money, and second because, if it is Syriza, it will be demanding far softer terms, as well as pitching for early debt forgiveness. Europe, which in essence means Germany, will then have to decide whether to continue to play the hard man or to give Greece room to manoeuvre. This is exactly what Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, does not need. The German view has been that the problems of the southern tier, while far from solved, had been contained and that it was now possible to concentrate on the structural and competitiveness issues faced by France and Italy, and indeed Germany itself. Now the Greek issue is back at the top of the agenda. The new European commission, under Jean-Claude Juncker, who has already sought to buy more time for the French and Italians, is likely to try to blunt the sharp edges of German rigour and may even relish the opportunity presented by Greece to demonstrate independence of Berlin. Even if Syriza fails to gain a victory, it will almost certainly not fall very far short of one. For Brussels and Berlin, this will pose in a sharper form than before the question of how they can go on demanding the implementation of policies that have been passionately rejected by electorates in member countries.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Diet advice from overweight GPs more likely to be ignored, finds survey", "content": "Britons are much less likely to follow advice from health professionals such as GPs and nurses if the health professionals are overweight or obese, a new survey shows. Polling commissioned by the Royal Society for Public Health (RSPH) found that 41% of people would be less likely to take advice about adopting a healthy diet from an NHS member of staff who was carrying extra pounds, while just 17% said they would heed it. Similarly, 48% would be less likely to take advice about exercise and diet from an overweight GP and just fewer than one in 10 – 9% – would heed it. In comparison, 59% would follow such advice if it came from a GP who was not overweight. Just over half (51%) of the 2,100 adults polled said they would listen to advice from an overweight nurse. And while 38% would be less likely to take advice from an overweight health professional on the need to undertake regular exercise, 16% said that would make them more likely to heed it. Populus’s survey for the RSPH also found 32% of people would take exercise and diet advice from a firefighter of normal weight, as would 44% from a pharmacist with a healthy body mass index, and 16% from a hairdresser the same weight. “It’s clear that the public are more inclined to take advice from those of us who are a healthy weight,” said Shirley Cramer, the society’s chief executive. “It appears that healthcare professionals need to be role models in order to help convince the public of the importance of losing weight.” The readiness to listen to a firefighter, pharmacist or hairdresser was encouraging and would become more important as non-traditional public health personnel started giving healthy lifestyle advice, she added. Women are more likely to accept such tips from a celebrity (18%) or hairdresser who is not overweight (20%) than men. Just 11% and 12% of males said they would do that. The findings pose a challenge to the NHS. Some 700,000 NHS staff in England, more than half its 1.3 million-strong workforce, are estimated to be overweight or obese. About two-thirds of the population as a whole are the same. Simon Stevens, NHS England’s chief executive, has urged the service to make it easier for personnel to lead healthier lives by making the food in hospital canteens more nutritious and introducing gyms and incentives to lose weight. Meanwhile, a separate survey has found that 20% of Britons would do without one of their fingers in return for gaining the perfect body shape. The finding, from responses by 2,000 adults surveyed by the body confidence organisation Be Real, came as campaigners warned people to beware diets, many of which do not yield weight loss. “People are increasingly obsessed with diets. But actually, at the same time as a nation we are getting bigger. It is obviously a fixation that doesn’t work,” said Conservative MP Caroline Nokes, the chairwoman of Be Real. Young women are most likely to become fixated with losing weight, though young children – even pre-teens – can also become affected, added Nokes, who is also chairwoman of the all-party parliamentary group on body image. The survey found that a fifth of adults had skipped meals to try to lose weight, while a quarter admitted they found it hard to maintain exercise and diet regimes. Charlotte Dickens, a GP in London and chairwoman of the campaign’s health committee, said those who diet were risking their health by striving for perfection that cannot be achieved.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Leo Tindemans obituary", "content": "Leo Tindemans, the former Belgian prime minister and veteran centre-right politician, who has died aged 92, will be best remembered as one of the fathers of European integration. It was his report in 1976 that laid down the idea of a “people’s Europe”, foreshadowing ideals such as economic and monetary union and common foreign and security policies, which would later alarm theoretically natural allies such as the British Conservatives, but which at the time earned him the sobriquet Mr Europe. He was once heard musing that what he would really have liked to have been was foreign minister of a large European country. Tindemans, tall, thin, naturally courteous and dignified, was a dominant force in Belgian politics for many years, prime minister from 1974 to 1978 and minister for foreign affairs for most of the 1980s. He was the architect of the constitutional settlement in which was rooted a Belgian federal state whose three language groups, the Wallonian French-speakers, the Flemish of the north and Germans in the eastern fringes, together with the capital, Brussels, had their own regional governments. This project has in recent years inadvertently caused significant difficulties in forming a stable, collaborative, national government, a stasis that grieved his generation. Tindemans was from a long line of Flemish prime ministers broken only recently. He was mayor of the small town of Edegem, near Antwerp, a post he retained for 11 years even while he was prime minister. He lacked the spikiness of other Flemish politicians towards the francophone community and was fluent in French and English. As someone who grew to maturity during the second world war years, he was a natural anglophile, despite the trials of having to deal with Thatcherite British ministers and the contrariness of Tory MEPs. He was the son of a diesel mechanic in the port of Antwerp, Frans Tindemans, and his wife, Margaret (nee Vercruyssen), in a society where politicians are not only either francophone or Flemish, but also either Freemasons or Catholics – traditionally alternating in office; he was definitely in the latter camp. At 18 he became a refugee – an experience that helped shape many postwar politicians’ attitudes to Europe – fleeing the German invasion in 1940 and witnessing the British army’s retreat to Dunkirk amid the ruins of his country. After the war, Tindemans studied economics at Ghent, Antwerp and the Catholic university of Leuven (then called Louvain) and, after briefly becoming a journalist and civil servant in the ministry of agriculture, entered politics as secretary general of the Flemish Christian Democrats in 1958. Thereafter, his rise through party ranks was rapid. He was elected to the Belgian chamber of deputies in 1961, minister of community affairs from 1968, then minister of agriculture and, quaintly, the middle classes, before becoming deputy prime minister, then two years later, in 1974, prime minister, just as the oil crisis took hold. During this period he also became involved in wider European affairs, with broader international connections, with elder statesmen such as the French economist Jean Monnet and, thanks to a year at Harvard, with Henry Kissinger, who became a lifelong friend. As prime minister he presided over a coalition government with the more rightwing, business-orientated Liberals, commanding a joint majority of 155 in a 212-member parliament. That position of strength did not stop him coming under physical threat from Belgian hunters as he tried to implement a Common Market wild birds directive – they were sufficiently intimidating to force him to sleep away from home for a while – or from seeing his government buffeted by the oil price rises. “This is not a thunderstorm, it is a climatic change,” he remarked perceptively. In the same year, at the December EEC summit in Paris, Tindemans was charged, following an initiative by Harold Wilson, with setting out the definitive future of Europe. His report, published two years later, characteristically called Europe, Ideal of Our Generation, was seminal in setting out a goal of long-term integration and was accordingly sidelined at the time by European leaders. It suggested a gradual ending of the national vetoes of the then nine member states, the establishment of a common defence policy, the creation of an internal single market, and the appointment of one Europe minister to represent the community to the US. Far from being the hidden agenda later ascribed to the EU by British Eurosceptics, the report spelled it out: “European union implies that we present a united front to the outside world. We must co-ordinate our action in all the main fields of our external relations ... its aim is not only to defend our interests but also to use our collective strength to support whatever is just and legal in world discussions. “European union recognises the interdependence of the economic prosperity of our states and accepts the consequences of this: a common economic and monetary policy to cope with this prosperity, common policies in the industrial and agricultural sector and on energy and research ...” When, two decades later, Margaret Thatcher complained she had not realised what was involved in signing up to the single market, Tindemans commented wryly: “That is probably true.” Re-elected in 1977, Tindemans resigned as prime minister a year later as the governing coalition, now including the socialists, fell out over the need for economic austerity measures to combat oil price rises and the decline of the old Wallonian – hence francophone – heavy industries of iron, coal and steel. The centre-right proposed cuts in welfare benefits; the socialists favoured tax hikes – and perennial proposals to improve the efficiency of the country’s notoriously lax tax-collecting effort. When a new government finally emerged in 1979, it was with Tindemans’s one-time protege, and later, rival, Wilfried Martens in charge, as he was to be for the next 13 years. Tindemans himself eventually became foreign minister in 1981, briefly entangling with Britain over the Falklands, and, later, in that graveyard of Belgian foreign policy, Zaire. Thatcher was understandably incandescent at the height of the Falklands crisis when a junior functionary of the Belgian government who was on duty one weekend declined a request to supply ammunition to the British expeditionary force. The move was swiftly rescinded and the anglophile Tindemans personally played a significant part in rallying European support for the British case, but the incident long rankled with Thatcher. Tindemans was a natural co-founder of the European right’s attempt to establish a multinational political group, the European People’s party (EPP) – from which David Cameron withdrew Britain’s Tories in 2009 – and, increasingly, his attentions turned to the Strasbourg parliament. He was sufficiently distinguished in a gathering of placemen and second-raters to be known as Million Vote Man, because of the size of his majority in Belgium in the parliament’s first direct elections in 1979, the EPP becoming the dominant force in the parliament throughout most of the 80s and 90s. Elected leader of the EPP in 1992, he was brought down two years later over the thorny issue of British Tory MEPs’ membership of the group. He was replaced by his nemesis Martens, who had himself then fallen from power in Belgium. As an elder statesman, Tindemans remained true to his European ideals, calling for a US-style constitution for Europe and predicting at an early stage that an indefinite military presence would be needed in the Balkans. In 1995 he was instrumental, along with the US media mogul Ted Turner, the financier George Soros, the former French prime minister Michel Rocard and others, in creating the London-based International Crisis Group, to monitor nascent trouble. He is survived by his wife Rosa Naesens, whom he married in 1960, and their four children, Thomas, Pia, Nora and Bruno, and 12 grandchildren. • Leo Tindemans, politician, born 16 April 1922; died 26 December 2014",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"We need a dose of cool, calm liberalism", "content": "The recent heated flurry of letters about Christianity and tolerance (29 December) understates the disastrous impact of Christianity upon the world. Voltaire and an array of sceptical philosophers pointed out the inconsistencies in the New Testament. The Gospels and Paul’s letters are a virtual diatribe against the Jews as Christ-killers. To the persecuted Jews, Christ is the traitor who has hunted them down for two millennia. Within Christianity, sects have turned on each other. Across continental Europe, Roman Catholicism was associated with pitiless royal absolutism and, eventually, with the brimstone of fascism. The Church of England, as the religious establishment, schemed to beat down for centuries the radical dissenters – Quakers, Baptists, and then Methodists. There would simply be no compassionate, level-headed, moderate civilisation without the advent of liberalism as exemplified by John Stuart Mill, who loathed the monopolistic tendencies inherent in Anglicanism. Liberalism, under threat from unrepentant Tory critics, seems the guarantor of tolerance, of which Christianity has always been the enemy. Cool, calm liberalism should be described as the answer, while Christianity is the essence of conservatism at its most vindictive. Zekria Ibrahimi London • Freedom to worship is the expression of wider rights: the freedoms of expression and of association. It is these that require upholding. The focus on religious worship is not only a distraction from those rights but also a weakening of inner spiritually and devotion.

{ "title":"Resurrecting the railways killed off by mistakes of yesteryear", "content": "Thanks for Ian Jack’s interesting piece (Amid the weeds, this new rail line will be clattering through 75 miles of history, 10 December). However, he was perhaps incorrect in stating that the Oxford University railway club never travelled the line. A book of the line shows photographs taken on the University Railway Society (presumably the same) rail tours in 1981 and 1982 that passed through Verney Junction. The book also records other special passenger trains that ran on the line up to the early 1990s. I once travelled from Paddington to Corby on one such train. Ironically, the line was closed to passengers in 1967, the same year that saw the creation of the new town of Milton Keynes through which it ran. Such was the lack of vision in those days that Milton Keynes was not the only new town that saw its railway passenger services withdrawn soon after designation. The Milton Keynes Development Corporation tried to encourage rail travel by sponsoring Christmas shopping trips from Aylesbury and elsewhere during the 1980s. These called at many of the old stations, including I am sure Verney Junction. Sadly, like Ian Jack, locals share his pessimism over whether we will see the line restored in our lifetimes. Typically, the government is funding a Cambridge-Oxford road upgrade at the same time. Philip Ashbourn Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire • Ian Jack’s wonderfully evocative article highlighted the potential of the now committed Varsity or East West Rail line to serve the six fastest-growing cities in England. But “Verney Junction’s days are over” was, we hope, unduly pessimistic as we are promoting this old station and its flat, relatively empty landscape as a new garden village and, we hope, new town. The location’s clearly apparent strengths can, we are arguing, be the basis for relieving the surrounding towns and villages of never-ending development pressures and unsustainable new housing. We hope to make maximum use of the government’s commitment to this new infrastructure and its non-green-belt location to provide an environmentally as well as economically supportable new community. If we can succeed this would perhaps, at last, fulfil the vision of those who have gone before and give Ian Jack his reason for the station to exist. Jonathan Naughton Partner, Garden Cities LLP • “The ‘Varsity Line’ … did people ever call it that?” So asks Ian Jack. About 40 years ago, in a campaign to cut car use, the Milton Keynes Transport Users’ Group (MK Tug), urged the restoration of the railway which could make connections with the universities at Cambridge and Cranfield, the Open University at Milton Keynes, the University of Buckingham and the two universities in Oxford. Of course, we called it the Varsity Line. Christopher Nankivell (Former chair, MK Tug), Birmingham • Re Chris Grayling’s Oxford-Cambridge line, let’s be clear. This was not on the list of lines to be closed in Beeching’s report. Even more clear (and I am ashamed) is that it was closed by Labour (Barbara Castle has a lot to answer for). Worse, the trackbed was not preserved. Houses were built at Potton station and other areas towards Cambridge – all of which increases the cost of reinstatement. Add this to the loss of the Midland Main Line Derby-Matlock-Manchester and the original HS2 – the Great Central through Leicester and Nottingham to Sheffield and Manchester – the first of which again was not proposed for closure – and we look incredibly shortsighted. And now we complain of lack of capacity! By all means close uneconomic lines, but don’t build on the right of way. New businesses and new housing can change the economics within a decade. Remember too that what was closed might have been an inefficient labour-intensive steam-era semaphore-signalled railway, not a modern diesel or electric line. Robert Bracegirdle Gawsworth, Cheshire • The apparent “brainwashing” of children in schools along the HS2 route, supposedly encouraging them to support the scheme (HS2 rail firm stands accused of ‘Orwellian’ bias in schools’, 13 December), carried a whiff of deja vu. In the heady and distant days of plans to have Eurostar trains coming directly from France to Manchester via Crewe, Cheshire schoolchildren took part in art competitions, producing wonderful colourful paintings, based on French artists’ styles, extolling the virtues of getting on a train in Crewe and getting off at some exotic place like the south of France. Many of these were even displayed on the stations, and on an immense sign at Longsight locomotive depot in Manchester, where the Eurostar trains were going to be based, bearing the caption, in a great visual fanfare, “Eurostar est ici…” Sadly, the art, the sign, and the promise gradually began to fade, peel and fall off. The trains never arrived, never departed, and aspiration and enthusiasm were crushed. So I’m not holding my breath about HS2, nor do I believe I have enough breaths left in me ever to see it happen. The criminality here is – and was then – to build up young hopes, and then knock them away again.

{ "title":"Reality check: will it take 10 years to do a UK-EU trade deal post Brexit?", "content": "Britain’s ambassador to the European Union, Sir Ivan Rogers, has said it could take up to 10 years to negotiate a post-Brexit UK-EU trade deal – and even then it risks being rejected by national parliaments. Are trade deals really that complicated to negotiate? Trade deals are monumentally complex. When Greenland, a country with a population smaller than that of Uxbridge and an economy based essentially on a single industry (fishing), withdrew from the EU in 1985, it took three years to negotiate its future relationship with the bloc. Ceta, the EU-Canada deal, took seven years to negotiate and was about 22 years in the making. But this was a relatively simple trade agreement that does not include the services provisions and deals on non-tariff barriers that a big exporter of professional services such as Britain will almost certainly require. Deals between larger economies such as the US/EU Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) and the US/Asia deal known as the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) proved so complicated and controversial that they have collapsed under their own political weight. Can a future trade deal be discussed during article 50 exit talks? The two-year article 50 talks, due to begin before the end of March next year, deal with the divorce arrangements: the exit bill the UK must pay to cover past and future budget commitments; the rights of EU citizens living in the UK and vice versa; the fate of the EU agencies located in Britain. Article 50 says the exit deal must take “the framework of the future relationship” into account, so there will need to be some clarity on a broad post-Brexit outline. But EU leaders are adamant there can be no concrete “shadow negotiations” on trade as part of the article 50 process, and the union cannot conclude a free trade agreement with another country while it is still a member. So it seems likely substantive talks on the detail of the new deal will not start until at least March 2019. How long could ratification take? EU procedures for ratifying trade agreements are much tougher than for ratifying the article 50 withdrawal deal, which needs only a qualified majority in the council and a majority in the European parliament. A trade agreement cutting across policy areas in the preserve of member states would be classed as a “mixed agreement” and require unanimity in the council, a majority in the European parliament, and ratification in all 27 national parliaments as well as in some regional parliaments (including that of Wallonia, which almost derailed the Ceta deal). That is 36 legislatures, each with a veto. Donald Tusk, the European council president, has said repeatedly the negotiation and ratification process could take between five and seven years. Brussels insiders, particularly trade specialists, think this is highly optimistic. Wouldn’t it be quicker to start from scratch? Even the nuclear option – a hard Brexit followed by reliance on existing World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules – could take years to achieve. The first, and more surmountable, problem is that Britain is a signatory to WTO deals through its membership of the EU. Assuming other WTO members agree to overlook this and transfer existing rights to Britain without seeking to unpick unpopular elements, there is an even bigger problem. This relates to the import and export quotas shared among EU member states. In the case of lamb, for example, the WTO schedule permits 283,825 tonnes of sheep and goat meat to be imported duty-free into the EU from 14 countries, ranging down to just 100 tonnes from Greenland. British farmers would need to fight to secure their share of this existing schedule to export into EU and non-EU markets, a fiendishly complicated prospect just in one small agricultural category. What would a transitional deal contribute? British business leaders as well as the chancellor, Philip Hammond, have argued that a transitional deal will be essential to smooth over the Brexit bump, ease uncertainty, and prevent the UK economy plunging off a cliff edge should Britain exit the EU at the end of the article 50 process with no future deal in sight. Several EU politicians, including the Luxembourg prime minister, Xavier Bettel, have expressed reluctance, saying the union is not prepared to create a new status of “‘a little bit member’, ‘pending divorce’, ‘nearly divorced’.” For the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, an interim deal would have “some point and usefulness” only once Britain has explained exactly what it wants from its future relationship with the EU, and the bloc had established what it could accept. At present, it was “difficult to imagine”, he said.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Czechoslovakia spied on Donald and Ivana Trump, communist-era files show", "content": "The secret service of communist-era Czechoslovakia spied extensively on Donald Trump, it has emerged, with one informant alleging in 1977 that the future US president-elect “is completely tax-exempt for the next 30 years”. The Státní bezpečnost or StB – the then communist state’s intelligence agency which dealt with any activity considered dangerous to the state or of western influence – spied on Trump and his Czechoslovak-born wife, Ivana, in the 1970s and 80s when she made regular trips back to visit her father, Miloš Zelníček. Stamped “top secret” and bearing the code names “Slusovice”, “America” and “Capital”, the files detail the obsession Czech spies had in gathering as much information about the US property tycoon as possible. Uncovered by Czech television and the German tabloid Bild, the dossiers include one that concentrates solely on the pre-nuptial agreement made between the Trumps. In the case of a marriage breakdown, he agreed to pay her $1m, according to the StB file. An informant with the cover name “Lubos” reported to his superiors in 1977 how Ivana had begun work at a petrol station in Austria, where she had met her first husband in 1968. She had then emigrated to Canada, where she married Trump. A tale of many Trumps: book reveals the showman, womaniser and slick operator Read more Another spy reported in 1977 that Trump’s businesses were “absolutely safe” because they received commissions from the state. The informant added: “Another advantage is the personal relationship [he has] with the American president [presumably Jimmy Carter] and the fact that he is completely tax-exempt for the next 30 years.” During this year’s election campaign, the New York Times obtained tax records that the paper said showed Trump could have used a $916m loss reported on his 1995 tax return to avoid paying income tax for up to 18 years. Asked about the story during one of the presidential debates, Trump acknowledged that this was accurate. In 1988 a further informant working under the cover name “Milos” reported that Trump was being put under considerable pressure to run for the US presidency. The Czech authorities should be made aware, he said, that Ivana was under pressure herself to not put a step wrong during visits to Czechoslovakia, or else she risked putting her husband’s potential candidacy in jeopardy. “Any false step of hers will have incalculable consequences for the position of her husband who intends to run for president in 1996,” Milos wrote. He added that Trump was convinced he could win the presidency. An earlier report on the 1988 US election campaign noted that Trump had donated two payments of $10,000 each to the Democrats and the Republicans. Ivana Trump had been convinced that George HW Bush would win and had been proved right, the report added. The StB went so far as to send a spy to the US to monitor Trump, believing that if he was to succeed in becoming US president it could have a significant impact on Czechoslovak-US relations. A note by an StB spy named “Al Jarda” of 10 October 1989 details a visit made to Trump by a delegation from a communist agricultural production cooperative from Slusovice, the village where Ivana Trump’s father lived. “They were given a welcome by one of the richest men in New York, Mister Donald Trump. He got them to explain to him extensively about the work of the cooperative and its further plans in the field of trade,” Al Jarda wrote. At the end of the visit Trump was invited to visit Slusovice. It is not believed that he ever took them up on the offer. Details of how the Trumps were to be spied on are also held in the StB’s archives. One order dated 1979 states that the phone calls between Ivana and her father are to be tapped at least once a year and their mail is to be constantly monitored. It is noted that Ivana speaks to her children in Czech even when she is in the US as well as detailing the friends and acquaintances of the Czech branch of her family. A Czech historian said the fact that Ivana’s father was registered as an “StB confidant” did not mean he worked as an agent for them. “Rather the CSSR authorities forced him to talk to them because of his journeys to the US to see his daughter. If he hadn’t spoken to them he would not have been given permission to fly,” Tomáš Vilímek told Bild. Donald and Ivana Trump were married in 1977 and divorced in 1992. They have three children. The StB was dissolved following the collapse of communism in 1990. The Trump transition team has been contacted for comment.",diasaster:0},

Pay@Pump allows drinkers to order and pour their own pint and pay with a contactless card or device touched on a pad at the base of the pump. The technology has been devised by Barclaycard – and a prototype designed and installed in a Central London pub, Henry’s Café Bar - to help reduce queuing time for customers buying drinks during busy periods. The average waiting time at the bar during the Christmas party season is 12 minutes per order, according to research carried out for Barclaycard, totalling 35 minutes per person during a festive night out. Almost one in four (24%) of bar-goers admitted they had considered abandoning a drinks purchase because of long bar queues, while 20% have gone elsewhere when facing a lengthy wait. “I’m sure everyone has been stuck behind the person who orders the most complicated cocktail on the menu or a round of 10 drinks for their group of friends,” said Tami Hargreaves, the commercial director, digital consumer payments, at Barclaycard. “When people told us that waiting time was one of their biggest annoyances, we wanted to help solve a common problem with a simple solution.” Facebook Twitter Pinterest Beer will only be served following a successful contactless payment. Photograph: Yui Mok/PA The pump incorporates Barclaycard’s contactless technology and electronics to allow the beer supply to be regulated and turned on following successful payment. It is hoped it will be rolled out nationally next year, not only in bars and pubs but also at large music festivals and concerts to help speed up service. One in five card payments by Britons are now contactless, a technology that launched in the UK in 2007. At that stage, tap-and-go or touch-and-go was largely confined to coffee shops and sandwich chains but is now widely available in shops and bars.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Judaism brings God into the home in a way that Christianity rarely does", "content": "I’m writing under the bedcovers, metaphorically speaking. I’m supposed to be on paternity leave but don’t like the idea of not doing this column, so I’m working in a few snatched moments between nappy changes and feeds. Nonetheless I’m keeping my promise to stay at home and so am taking a break from all the activity of the church in the run-up to Christmas. Not only that, but my mother-in-law is over from Tel Aviv to coo over her new grandchild and take charge of the kitchen. And with her arrival, the common language of the vicarage has shifted to Hebrew, with me struggling to keep up. All of which draws my attention to something that sociologists of religion often remark upon: that many of the great liturgies and festivals of Judaism centre on the home in a way that they do not with catholic Christianity – Christmas being the only possible exception. With catholic Christianity – and that includes my part of the C of E – religion is for church. Very occasionally, I say prayers before meal times. Usually, it has to be said, when we have the bishop round for supper. And when a parishioner is too ill to make it to Sunday service, I take the eucharist to them at home. But all this is small beer compared with the wealth of liturgical and semi-liturgical stuff that goes on in the Jewish home: from the three-line whip of eating at home on shabbat, to the grand meal of the passover seder, from the ceremony of circumcision (traditionally performed at home unless too many people want to come), to sitting shiva for the dead. When Jews fix the mezuzah on the doorpost of their home, they are declaring their homes holy in a way that Christians rarely do. And while Jewish weddings don’t commonly take place at home, they do take place under the chuppah, which symbolises the home. This year, the festival of Hanukah begins on Christmas Eve, which further emphasises the contrast. My wife will light Hanukah candles at home. I will light Christmas candles in church. One common explanation for the catholic emphasis on church as opposed to home is that catholic Christianity maintained a firm distinction between the sacred and the profane. To be holy was to be set apart. To be a priest was not to be involved with worldly stuff. God was seen as more intensely present in special places and at special times. What dramatically changed all this was the Reformation and the rejection of the idea that the church is the middleman between human beings and God. With the Bible in the vernacular, you could read about God at home and not have to be told about God in church. This sucks power away from the church and begins its relocation to the home. Thus George Herbert could write, in 1633, words that became a much-loved hymn: “A servant with this clause makes drudgery divine: who sweeps a room as for Thy laws makes that and th’ action fine.” With the Reformation, the profane makes a religious comeback. In his magisterial Sources of the Self, the philosopher Charles Taylor calls this shift in sensibility “the affirmation of ordinary life” and links it to the Protestant deification of profane work, the Protestant work ethic, and ultimately as setting the scene for capitalism. For as God broke out of his imprisonment in churches, he came to be seen not just in the profane home but also in profane work. Thus hard work, making money work, previously distinguished from God’s holy work done by religious people, came to be invested with some higher religious purpose. But this affirmation of profane work became too successful. For even when secularisation took God out of the picture, the Protestant idea persisted that not working hard enough is some sort of secular sin or moral failing. And now we are slaves to that idea. Which is why I’m going to enjoy a guilt-free paternity leave, messing around with my son, eating my mother-in-law’s borscht and lighting our candles. My Jewish relatives are all secular Israelis – yet it is they, not I, who have introduced religious liturgies into our house. And I thank them for bringing God home.

In Spain immigrants make up about 15% of the population but represent less than 1% of the country’s lawmakers. 'We are in uncharted waters': readers react to the Spanish general election Read more Born in Equatorial Guinea, 50-year-old Bosaho moved to Spain more than three decades ago, working as a nurse before she made the jump to politics. Motivated by what she calls an “obsession” for human rights and worried about what kind of world she was leaving behind for her child, she decided to add her name to the list of Podemos candidates in the coastal city of Alicante. “It’s a window that’s open to the future,” she said of her party. The amount of attention she has received in recent weeks has surprised her, she told Spanish news agency Efe. “Why is it so striking that a black woman could end up in parliament? What does that say about us all being integrated?” The dearth of diversity in Spain’s institutions, she said, comes down to a lack of opportunities. “It’s a structural problem that needs to be put in context, looking at the social panorama of Spain.” Known in Alicante for her activism in gender issues, one of her goals is to push the central government to do more to address violence against women and raise the profile of women in government. “We talk about rights and equality and the constitution protects us,” said Bosaho. “But what happens with institutional representation or women in business? Why aren’t our voices being heard there?” Sunday’s election saw a record number of women voted into the country’s lower parliament, with about 138 female MPs as compared with the 125 women elected in the 2011 general election.

{ "title":"10 things you need to know about the price of oil", "content": "The price of oil has fallen to a fresh low, with a glut of production coming not just from US frackers but also from Iran as sanctions are lifted. Supermarkets are fighting each other to offer unleaded petrol at below £1 a litre, and economists are pencilling in higher growth as consumers feel the benefit. On Monday morning the price of Brent crude fell another 1.6% to hit just $36.30. So what does this mean for motorists and everyone else? 1. Crude oil is back to 2004 levels, but petrol is not When Brent crude oil was last at $36 in summer 2004, motorists were paying 79p a litre for petrol and 80p for diesel. Today, the average is 102p for petrol and 106p for diesel, although both can be found at 99p a litre in some supermarket forecourts. 2. Motorists are generally not being ripped off by garages There is a floor on how far the price of petrol can fall. The government takes 57.95p in fuel duty for every litre sold, plus charges another 20% in VAT, so even if the cost of oil was zero, petrol prices would still be around 70p a litre. 3. Diesel drivers probably are being ripped off The wholesale price for diesel is around 3p per litre below that of unleaded petrol, but the average forecourt price is 4p more. The RAC reckons some retailers are using price falls to increase margins on diesel. 4. It’s good for the economy and borrowers Inflation, currently just 0.1%, is being held in check by falling oil prices. This takes pressure off the Bank of England to increase the base rate, which is unlikely to start rising until next summer at the earliest. If oil stays at or below $50 a barrel, then it adds 1% year to the size of the economy, according to consultant PwC. It reckons it adds 90,000 to 120,000 jobs, and increases consumer spending. The government makes more from taxing the additional income than what it loses from tax on North Sea oil producers. And as the North Sea fields run dry and Britain imports more, the falling oil price cuts our yawning trade gap. 5. Not everyone drives or spends that much on petrol It’s good financially for two-car households where both have long commutes, with the AA estimating that the price of filling up the average tank is down £9.60 this year. But the average spend on petrol was just £23 a week in 2014, according to the latest official Family Spending survey, down 50p a week from a year earlier. That compares with a total weekly spend of £531, so while price falls are good, it’s not going to have an incredible impact on household budgets. Motorists doing the typical 7,500 miles a year will save around £150 in 2015 compared with 2014. 6. It’s bad news for the environment Ford’s Lincoln Navigator is a “full-size luxury SUV” and manages just 15 miles per gallon in town, yet sales were up 88% in November, as drivers cast off worries about gas prices. In the UK, consumers are dumping estate cars for smaller “crossove” SUVs, with the Vauxhall Mokka and Nissan Qashqai among the top 10 sellers in the market, although the “super-mini” sector has shown the fastest growth. In Australia, the Nissan X Trail is leading a big increase in SUV sales, up 16% over the year. But while petrol consumption has risen in the US – by around 500m barrels a day compared with last year – and is up sharply in India, the experts are puzzling over what’s happening in the UK. From January to November 2014, UK vehicle oil consumption ran at around 1.47bn litres per month, but over the same period this year it has fallen to around 1.44bn litres per month, despite the drop in petrol prices. At the AA, economists wonder if this is because of other pressures on household budgets, such as rising rents. 7. Airlines are loving this, and so are frequent flyers Aviation fuel makes up around 46% of Ryanair’s operating costs, and 33% of costs at British Airways. Many airlines have been locked into pricey contracts, but with jet fuel prices down by 35% over the past year, and the hedged positions unwinding, their costs are falling dramatically. Already in 2015, airlines have saved nearly $90bn on fuel. Look for signs of an airline price war in early 2016, with Ryanair already predicting price cuts. 8. Your pension manager is worried Shell and BP are the second and fourth biggest payers of dividends on the UK stock market respectively, and are traditionally the major holdings in any income fund. Sustaining dividends with oil at $36 is going to be a near impossible task. BP’s share price is down from 484p to 344p since May, while Royal Dutch Shell is down from 2,100p to 1,475p. It partly explains why the FTSE 100 has performed so abysmally in recent months – it is peculiarly vulnerable to commodity price falls, with so many of the giant oil and mining stocks listed in London. 9. India, China and Japan gain; the middle east, Russia and Venezuela lose India imports around 75% of its oil, so price falls are beneficial to its economy. China is also a net importer. The Russian government loses around $2bn for every $1 fall in oil prices, but for crisis-hit Venezula, it’s catastrophic, with 90% of the country’s exports being oil. It is estimated that Iran needs an oil price of around $134 to balance its national budget, and even super-rich Qatar needs $77. The conventional wisdom is that Saudi Arabia is keeping the pumps flowing to destroy the US fracking industry. But it doesn’t seem to be working; US fracking production peaked in April at around 9.6m barrels per day, but has fallen only slightly since, with new technology enabling many fields to make money even with lower oil prices. 10. Your insurance company will swipe some of the gains Drivers pocketing savings at the petrol pumps will be passing some of that cash over to their insurers. After several years of declining premiums, the industry is aiming to push through rate increases of around 8% in 2016, according to consultant Ernst & Young.",diasaster:0},

But data protection watchdog the Information Commissioner’s Office found the newspaper’s parent company, Telegraph Media Group, broke direct marketing rules. Daily Telegraph backs Tories with email to marketing database Read more The watchdog said subscribers might have signed up to receive a daily email, but promoting the Tory election campaign “crossed a line”. “People may well perceive the paper’s editorial content to have a political bias, but when the Telegraph emailed people directly calling them to vote for a political party they crossed a line,” said Steve Eckersley, head of enforcement at the ICO. In his letter, Evans described the 7 May general election as “the most important since 1979” and urged Telegraph readers to vote Conservative. It added: “Do we continue under the Conservatives with the open, enterprise-led economic approach that has underpinned our prosperity for nearly 40 years? Or do we revert to an old-style, ‘government-knows-best’ culture championed by the most leftwing Labour leader for a generation?” Eckersley said: “People signed up to the Telegraph’s email service so they could catch up on the news or find out about subjects they were interested in. They did not expect to be told who they should be voting for.” The ICO said it accepted that Evans’s letter was only added to the usual mailing after a “last minute instruction from the editorial team”.

The press watchdog said the paper had made “significantly misleading” claims in its front-page story, published on 15 September and had only made an offer to correct them at the eleventh hour. The Sun reported that Corbyn “will kiss the Queen’s hand on bended knee in a humiliating personal climbdown”. It said he had become a privy counsellor so he can “grab £6.2m” of state cash.

The committee upheld the complaint.” However, complaints that the Sun’s depiction of Corbyn as a jester and its reference to him as a “leftie who hates the royals” were not misleading, Ipso said, because the image had been made to “lampoon” the Labour leader and because Corbyn himself had given public statements opposing the monarchy. Ipso said that, while the Sun accepted that it “could have been clearer in certain respects, the newspaper defended its coverage overall as legitimate speculation based on accurate information”. Nick Sutton (@suttonnick) Tuesday's Sun front page: Christmas Humpers #tomorrowspaperstoday #bbcpapers pic.twitter.com/2NRTQRbQhg December 21, 2015 The Sun argued that it could demonstrate a direct link between Corbyn’s acceptance of a place on the privy council and short money because “around £700,000 of the total would be allocated to the running costs of its leader’s office and would be available only if he secured his position as leader of the opposition by joining the privy council; had Mr Corbyn failed to do so, the entire £6.2m available to Labour could have been at risk”. But Ipso ruled that the article had “referred repeatedly to the sum of £6.2m in the context of Mr Corbyn’s role as opposition leader, but had not clarified that the great majority of the funding relates to the party as a whole, as an opposition party, rather than the leader of the opposition specifically”. It added that the paper had “also failed to clarify that Short money is allocated based on the number of seats won by a party in opposition, rather than any specific role leading the opposition, and would therefore be unaffected by any concerns over Mr Corbyn’s status as opposition leader. This represented a further failure to take care not to publish misleading information”. News of the decision was first published by the Independent on Monday. Reacting to it, a spokesman for the Sun told the Guardian: “The only publications that will write about this decision have chosen not to abide by the press regulator, which is an irony worth noting.” The Guardian did not sign up to the regulator, writing in a leading article in September last year that it would “wait to see whether [its chairman] succeeds in reforming some of the governance issues that still cause anxiety”.

{ "title":"Spain edging towards Socialist-led coalition as negotiations begin", "content": "A Socialist-led coalition is shaping up to be the most likely to rule Spain as rival politicians laid down ground rules on Monday ahead of what are expected to be marathon political negotiations needed to form the country’s next government. Spanish election: national newcomers end era of two-party dominance Read more The conservative People’s party (PP) won 123 seats in Sunday’s election and 29% of the vote, leaving it a long way short of a majority in the 350-seat legislature. As the results came in, the party leader, Mariano Rajoy, vowed he would try to stay on as prime minister, despite a set of results that left him with few options to do so. “I will try and form a stable government,” Rajoy told cheering supporters on Sunday. “Spain needs stability, security, confidence and trust.” But with leftwing parties holding the balance of power in Spain’s parliament, the result is likely to mirror recent political events in Portugal, where the conservatives won the October election but fell to a socialist government backed by leftist parties just days later. Billed as Spain’s most vibrant and plural election in recent years, the vote chipped away at the country’s decades of two-party dominance and yielded a result that thrust the country into weeks – if not months – of political horse trading. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Owen Jones on the campaign trail with Podemos. In the coming days and weeks, King Felipe VI, who took over from his embattled father last year, will reach out to all parties to hear their positions and name the party that will have the chance to try and form a government. If the candidate fails to obtain an absolute majority, followed by a simple majority in a vote of confidence, the king must put forward a new candidate. If no government is formed within two months, new elections must be held. On Monday morning, as many in Spain waded through the potential scenarios, the Socialist party ruled out any possibility of backing the PP. “The Socialists will vote no to Rajoy. We’re going to vote no to the PP,” said César Luena, one of the party’s senior officials. The Socialists came second in Sunday’s election, earning 90 seats and 22% of the vote. Despite a result that ranked as their worst ever, the party is now central to the question of what comes next. “Spaniards voted for change and the left and we’re going to translate that to the confidence vote,” said Luena. Podemos: how Europe’s political centre is being eaten by the radical left and nationalist right Read more Anti-austerity party Podemos, which won 69 seats and 21% of the vote, said it would also block any attempt by Rajoy to form a government. “On no account will Podemos allow the PP to govern,” the leader, Pablo Iglesias, told reporters on Monday, ruling out the possibility of even abstaining during the vote of confidence. “The PP cannot form part of the future government of this country,” said Iglesias. By contrast, Ciudadanos’s leader, Albert Rivera, said his party would abstain from the confidence vote to allow the PP to form a minority government and urged the Socialists to do the same. “The Socialists need to show that they’re thinking more about Spain than what’s left of their party,” Rivera told Spanish media on Monday. “Spain cannot allow itself to be Greece. Spain cannot allow itself to be a chaotic country.” Facebook Twitter Pinterest Mariano Rajoy celebrates People’s party election result in Spain In the lead-up to the election, analysts predicted that Ciudadanos would be a key player in propping up a PP minority. The centre-right party won only 40 seats on Sunday, however, not enough to shield the PP from the no votes promised by the Socialists and Podemos. Rivera has consistently said he will not enter any kind of pact with the PP. As a result a Socialist government backed by Podemos seems increasingly likely. The Guardian view on the Spanish elections: the end of an era | Editorial Read more While both parties will find common ground in the appeal for change, the pairing comes with its perils; whereas the Socialists have pushed for constitutional reform to address the issue of Catalan independence, Iglesias said on Monday that a referendum on independence would be crucial for any party to secure Podemos’s support. Both parties will also have to weigh the risk of alienating their voter base, made up of rural, older voters in the case of the Socialists, and for Podemos, voters intent on doing away with the establishment parties. As Podemos ran under coalitions in several regions, any agreement with the Socialists could potentially be complicated by the stamp of approval needed from several other leftist movements, such as Barcelona en Comú or Compromís in Valencia. An alliance of the Socialists and Podemos would likely still need the support of other parties to advance their agenda, whether it be Ciudadanos or regional parties, such as the Republican Left of Catalonia and Artur Mas’s Democratic Convergence party. The necessity of more votes could amplify the importance of the smattering of separatist parties in the parliament and see the Socialists wrestled into concessions on Catalan independence as the price of gaining support. The option of Ciudadanos as a partner is complicated by Rivera’s strong stance in backing Rajoy as leader of the next government.

'We are in uncharted waters': readers react to the Spanish general election Read more On Monday, the PP urged its rivals to take a step back and consider the bigger picture. “I am asking everyone to show responsibility, because the stability of Spain is at stake, progress in the economic recovery is at stake,” PP official Fernando Martínez-Maillo told broadcaster Cadena Ser. The messy affair has shone new light on the role of King Felipe. While his father Juan Carlos’s abdication sent tens of thousands of Spaniards into the streets to demand a referendum on the future of the monarchy, polls suggest Felipe’s approval levels have since risen. His growth in popularity has been explained by his careful prudence, with speeches that steer clear of the push for democratic and institutional regeneration in Spain. But Sunday’s election result will likely force the king to wade into the crux of the issue, with the monarch central to what comes next. With Felipe set to deliver his televised Christmas eve speech on Thursday, many will be watching carefully for clues on what the future of the country’s government could look like.",diasaster:0},

The blazes follow a period of increased tension in the country, as politicians struggle to stem the rise of the anti-immigrant far right. The Säpo were called in after a blaze at a mosque in the southern town of Eslöv in the early hours of Monday morning. It followed a similar incident on Christmas Day in Eskilstuna, near Stockholm, in which five people were injured when a fire broke out during prayers. “It’s probably Islamophobia,” an Eslöv imam, Samir Muric, told Swedish media. “I live close and do not feel safe anymore.” Elvir Gigovic, chair of the Muslim Council of Sweden, said there had been a spate of “systematic” attacks on Muslims this year, many of which were marked by their violence and severity. The justice minister, Morgan Johansson, described the Eskilstuna fire as a “heinous atrocity” and said it was difficult to believe the incident was anything other than violence directed against Muslims. Heightened concern about attacks on Muslims comes after Saturday’s decision by Sweden’s leftwing coalition government to call off elections due in March after a last-minute compromise with centre-right parties. The deal enables both blocs to avoid potential humiliation at the polls by the far-right Sweden Democrats, which forced the crisis after blocking the government’s budget in parliament, where it holds the balance of power. Sweden Democrats leaders have likened Islamism to Nazism, and the party wants to cut the number of asylum seekers by 90%. This month, the leader of Sweden’s Jewish community condemned as “good old rightwing antisemitism” remarks by the party’s secretary that Jews could not be Swedes unless they abandoned their religious identity. The Sweden Democrats more than doubled their vote to 13% in September to become the country’s third-largest party; opinion polls suggest this month’s budget crisis further boosted support for the party to up to 18%. Surveys suggest a substantial majority of Swedes back this weekend’s compromise between the main left and right parties, seen as a welcome return to the country’s tradition of cross-party cooperation after a period of political turmoil. However, Sweden’s main business newspaper said cancelling the elections was “playing with fire” and “an insult to voters”. The Sweden Democrats said the deal confirmed it was the only genuine opposition force. The party has been shunned by mainstream politicians for its focus on immigration, but its pariah status has turned it into a martyr in the eyes of many supporters. There have been at least 13 suspected arson attacks on mosques in Sweden this year, according to Expo, an anti-racism magazine. A members-only Facebook page claiming to be a Sweden Democrats discussion forum posted comments praising the mosque fires, equality campaigners said. “What is happening now is an escalation due to the political success of parliamentary racism,” said Henrik Arnstad, a Stockholm-based author of research on fascism.

{ "title":"Miami battle over McMansion sparks plan to preserve historic houses", "content": "When millionaire entrepreneur John Jansheski decided he wanted to build a modern home to replace the ageing building that occupied his newly purchased lot on one of Miami’s most exclusive islands, he had two choices. The first was a solution becoming increasingly popular to wealthy owners seeking to upgrade, that of razing the old building irrespective of any architectural merits, historical significance or aesthetic considerations. Instead, Jansheski chose a highly unlikely and expensive option: lifting the structure from its foundations in its entirety and shifting it a hundred yards across the lot, serving the dual purpose of preserving a small slice of the city’s architectural past and preparing a space for its future. The relocation of the seven-bedroom Mediterranean-revival style mansion, Jansheski admits, cost him “hundreds of thousands of dollars”. But for the same money he calculated he would have spent on lawyers’ fees and demolition costs, he gets to save the 1924 Star Island villa designed by Walter DeGarmo, the famed architect credited with helping to shape the face of early to mid-20th century Miami, and earns considerable goodwill with the city’s vocal preservation movement into the bargain. “A lot of people thought we were stupid and crazy, it’s a lot of money to be spending,” said Jansheski, whose fortune came from founding oral care product company DenTek. “But it made my heart race looking at the old house in its new location and we feel very smart. We’re in a good situation, but I know it’s not for everyone. It’s not like we’re the saints and the demolishers are the sinners.” That is not how the preservationists see it, however. Earlier this year they lost a well-publicised and long-running battle to save a neighbouring period Star Island mansion owned by Jansheski’s close friend Leonard Hochstein, a prominent Miami plastic surgeon. Together with his wife Lisa, star of the reality TV series The Real Housewives of Miami, the doctor known colloquially as “the Boob God” for his “enhancement” of a largely celebrity clientele faced down two lawsuits during an often personal fight, and finally won permission for demolition in March. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Dr Leonard Hochstein and his wife, Lisa. Photograph: CW Griffin/MCT via Getty Images Already going up in its place is a 20,000 sq ft waterfront palace, complete with an enormous games room, walk-in wine cellar and 17-seat cinema. Such oversized homes, frequently occupied only by successful professional couples or their small families, have become known as McMansions. “Look, it wasn’t Vizcaya,” Hochstein said of his now flattened 8,000 sq ft house, referring to the extravagant and elegant Italian Renaissance villa built on Miami’s waterfront early last century and now a popular museum listed as a national historic landmark. “It was a very unspectacular property with no significance other than it was old. It was in very poor condition. Back in the 20s and 30s they mixed concrete with sand so it wasn’t very strong, and it didn’t meet any of the current building codes. There was really nothing to preserve. “I knew I had the law on my side and we were always confident we would win. But these people [the preservationists] dragged it along,” he told the Guardian. Ultimately, the preservationists lost because Star Island, home to celebrities including rapper Sean Combs and singer Gloria Estefan, and where properties change hands for tens of millions of dollars, is not a designated historic district of Miami Beach and the Hochsteins’ old house was not “architecturally significant” as per the city’s code for refusing demolition permits. Yet the contrasting tales of 42 Star Island, owned by the Hochsteins, and Jansheski’s residence at number 27, are symbolic of the growing push towards demolition of period houses, and the subsequent backlash and momentum towards their preservation. City of Miami Beach figures show that from 2005 to 2011, only 20 requests for the demolition and reconstruction of architecturally significant pre-1942 homes were submitted; another 20 more came in for the calendar year 2012; and from January to October 2013, the latest period for which figures are available, a further 40 applications were received. A Star Island residence is lifted in preparation for being moved. Photograph: Cesar Torres James Murphy, principal planner for the municipality, described the trend towards development as “off the chain” and said that the city’s Design Review Board, the ultimate authority in decisions of destruction versus preservation, was trying to keep up. “Development in Miami Beach, like many other cities, is resurgent and we are seeing many projects,” he said. “The city values the preservation of historic and architecturally significant homes and structures, and continuously strives to balance the need and desire to preserve our urban fabric while allowing for iconic new development to occur. We continue to support historic preservation while encouraging only the highest and best architecture for new development.” The preservationists, meanwhile, have been here before. The Miami Design Preservation League, which fought and won a battle in the late 1970s to save the curvy art deco facades of Miami Beach hotels and condominium blocks, is eyeing a way to convert what it claims to be a groundswell of support over the Hochstein villa into new legislation. It is discussing with city commissioners a proposal that would require any application involving a property more than 50 years old to automatically go through a formal review process before demolition could be approved. “McMansions don’t contribute anything to Miami Beach,” said Daniel Giraldo, preservation officer with the MDPL. “What happened with Hochstein made the community realise what we stand to lose and that buildings nobody thought would ever disappear did because people don’t care about history and care only about building their dream home. Miami Beach is a symphony of beautiful buildings, and just like an orchestra where you take out one piece, you take out one building and it doesn’t sound as good. “We have a treasure trove or remarkable architecture from the 1920s through to the second world war and it needs protection. There has been some progress but a lot more is needed, or much of our history is simply going to disappear.”",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"More than 400,000 schoolchildren being taught by unqualified teachers", "content": "More than 400,000 schoolchildren are being taught by unqualified teachers, according to research revealed by the shadow education secretary, Tristam Hunt. Labour’s education spokesman has made the issue of ending the use of unqualified teachers one of his central campaigns and this is the first time he has put a figure on the extent to which they are being used in schools. Michael Gove, the former education secretary, introduced the right for free schools and academies to use unqualified teachers in 2012. Labour claims the use of teachers who are not qualified leads to children in state schools being taught by people who have had no guaranteed training in safeguarding children, controlling a class or adapting teaching to respond to the strengths and needs of all pupils. Hunt said there were 17,100 unqualified teachers in state-funded schools – a rise of 16% in the past year. The number in academies and free schools rose by 50%. In November 2012 , there were 5,300 unqualified teachers in academies, technology colleges and free schools, according to Department for Education figures, but the number has since risen to 7,900. Hunt said 430,000 children were being taught by unqualified teachers, based on a class size average of 25.3. He said: “David Cameron’s decision to allow unqualified teachers to be permanently employed in schools is seriously threatening standards for hundreds of thousands of children – and the figures are rising. “Labour will reverse the unqualified teachers policy and put teaching standards first, with our ambition of a world-class teacher in every classroom. We will ensure that all teachers become properly qualified, continue to build their skills and are able to pursue new career pathways that keep the best teachers in the classrooms.” Hunt promised that a Labour government would ensure all permanently employed teachers were qualified and claimed Gove changed the rules despite massive polling evidence showing the reform was unpopular with parents. Gove argued that the change would make up the shortfalls in subjects such as computer science, engineering and languages, bringing state schools more in line with private schools where qualified teacher status is often desirable but not mandatory. Gove’s successor, Nicky Morgan, has set about rebuilding relations with teachers, but has not yet indicated she will drop the policy. However, a Gove-commissioned review into initial teacher training would provide a possible route to removing one of Hunt’s effective lines of attack. He claims Cameron is increasingly isolated on this issue and refuses to listen to the concerns of education experts, who describe the policy as retrograde. In June, the Liberal Democrats finally broke with their Tory coalition partners on the issue and gave a commitment that its manifesto would require all teachers to be working towards qualification or be qualified. Sir Michael Wilshaw, the chief inspector of schools, has said that unqualified teachers should be accredited as soon as possible after their appointment. Chris Husbands, the director of the Institute of Education, said the decision to remove the requirement for teachers to gain qualified teacher status in state-funded schools “flies in the face of evidence nationally and internationally”.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Downing Street files reveal how Oliver Letwin kept poll tax plans alive", "content": "A young adviser to Margaret Thatcher who is now a minister for David Cameron explicitly suggested that Scotland be used as a testing ground for the introduction of the poll tax, the flagship policy that was eventually to topple her as prime minister. Oliver Letwin, now a Cabinet Office minister, emerges in official papers publicly released on Tuesday as the man who single-handedly kept the idea of the poll tax alive in the mid 1980s despite attempts by two senior ministers to strangle it at birth. Downing Street files for 1985 and 1986 released at the National Archives show that it was Letwin, then just 29 but already working in Thatcher’s policy unit, who argued that the poll tax – then known as the residence charge – could be introduced in two stages. “If you are not willing to move to a pure residence charge in England and Wales immediately, you should not introduce a mixture of taxes but should rather use the Scots as a trail-blazer for the real thing,” Letwin told Thatcher in a memo written in November 1985. Letwin, whose parents knew Thatcher, had got his job on the recommendation of the cabinet minister Sir Keith Joseph. “If the Scottish experiment worked, it could make a pure residence charge look sensible rather than extreme, and thereby pave the way for its introduction in England and Wales,” said Letwin, confirming the long-made but never confirmed charge that Thatcher treated people in Scotland as “guinea pigs” for England and Wales. The reference to “a mixture of taxes” was no idle speculation as even Ken Baker, then environment secretary and Thatcher’s most ardent poll tax supporter, was having sufficient doubts to lend his support to a compromise solution. The 1985 cabinet papers show those doubts were fuelled by the combination of dire warnings from the then chancellor, Nigel Lawson, and the then home secretary, Douglas Hurd and by environment department tables of “winners and losers” which showed the devastating impact of a flat-rate poll tax not only on the poor but also on Conservative voters in the English shires. While Lawson warned that the introduction of the poll tax would be “politically catastrophic” for the Conservative party, Hurd even went so far as to compare the likely enforcement difficulties to the problem of collecting BBC licence fees in west Belfast. Lawson bluntly told the rest of the cabinet that the poll tax was “completely unworkable and politically catastrophic” in a cabinet committee memorandum in May 1985 which he later described as “the most strongly worded attack” he had launched on any policy proposal while he was in government. He described the official “specification report” published for the first time today as giving a “horrifying picture of the impact” with more than 7 million losers: “A pensioner couple in inner London could find themselves paying 22% of their net income in poll tax, whereas a better off couple in the suburbs pay only 1%. We should be forced to give so many exceptions and concessions (inevitably to the benefit of high spending authorities in inner London) that the flat-rate poll tax would rapidly become a surrogate income tax.” On 30 September 1985, Hurd tackled the problems of collection and enforcement of a local government tax that was to be widely attacked as making a ‘duke pay the same as a dustman’. He said it would be represented as a tax on the right to vote even though it would be based on a separate register from the electoral register. The home secretary warned it would be impossible to check whether everybody living in a certain house had been declared to pay the tax. “One can expect to find evasion and fiddling among all classes of people,” he warned before predicting the residents’ charge would be seen by the public “as being widely evaded and would bring the new system quickly into disrepute”. The difficulties of trying to operate the television licence system in west Belfast illustrated the problems that it might encounter in difficult areas, he added. The cabinet papers also show that the poll tax was not the brainchild of the Adam Smith Institute, as has been widely credited, but of Lord Victor Rothschild, who had headed Edward Heath’s Downing Street thinktank in the 1970s. Thatcher’s local government ministers, Patrick Jenkin and William Waldegrave, turned to Rothschild when Thatcher asked them to find an alternative to the rates. Lawson described this in his memoirs as a ‘fatal invitation’ – “Rothschild prided himself on having no political judgement. He was above that sort of thing. William Waldegrave seemed to regard this as an advantage.” The Downing Street files show that Thatcher herself saw Rothschild as the author of the poll tax and at one point asked him to “take a fatherly interest in the infant’s development.” The Cabinet papers show that in April 1985 after a Chequers summit where Thatcher had pressed ahead despite Lawson’s opposition, Rothschild had written to the prime minister telling her: “The community charge (as it was officially to become) is, I believe, a winner. But I am nervous lest it is accidentally or deliberately misinterpreted, for example: ‘Tories hit the poor again’, ‘No compassion for the have-nots’.” When further Department of Environment ‘winners and losers’ figures came in showing there would be 7.5m losers or 44% of the population, including significant numbers in low-spending English shire counties, even Ken Baker was prepared to consider alternatives. Rothschild again intervened with what he called Operation Gynandromorph – “I don’t know if the prime minister did Greek”, he asked before explaining it meant hybrid – involving a new mixed tax based on the square footage of a property and the number of people in the home to deal with the problem of a poor pensioner couple living in overcrowded accommodation. The idea was rapidly seized on by Baker and Waldegrave as a possible answer. In November 1985 Letwin told Thatcher however that while it dramatically reduced the number of losers it was still “electorally dangerous”. Instead he seized on the situation in Scotland where George Younger, the Scottish secretary, was desperate for an alternative to the rates after a politically disastrous domestic rating revaluation had laid waste to Tory fortunes north of the border. Letwin told Thatcher: “You have an apparent dilemma: a sudden move to residence charges in England and Wales is too dangerous; but a gradual transition via a mixed tax is unattractive. We believe that George Younger may offer us a way out of this dilemma. He is extremely keen to use Scotland as trail-blazer for the pure residence charge,” reported Letwin. What sold it to Thatcher however was the fact that as Letwin pointed out it would also unite the cabinet as “since the radicals would be able to trumpet the Scottish experiment, and the sceptics would be comforted by the absence of any turbulence on the English domestic front.” Letwin told Thatcher, using a helpful table showing just how deeply split the cabinet was on the issue. Thatcher could only count on the definite support of five ministers to press ahead the poll tax in England and Wales first – including Younger, Baker, Nicholas Ridley, Nicholas Edwardes and Lord Whitelaw. Three more ‘might be pro’ – Norman Tebbit, Leon Brittan and Sir Keith Joseph. Four – Lawson, Hurd, Michael Heseltine and Lord Hailsham – were listed as definitely against. The remaining ten, including Ken Clarke and Geoffrey Howe, were put down as waiverers. Letwin was proved right in that the Scottish pilot scheme united the cabinet and kept the idea of the poll tax alive. By January 1986, Baker had published a green paper on scrapping the domestic rates with the poll tax at its centrepiece. The steamroller was to prove unstoppable all the way to the mass riots of 1990 after its introduction into England and Wales – and its role in triggering Thatcher’s downfall six months later.",diasaster:0},

John, who has died of cancer aged 62, was the quiet, unassuming heart of the peace movement in Scotland for the last 25 years. As well as putting himself on the line, he became an authoritative and internationally respected nuclear researcher. He was the author of 20 reports on aspects of nuclear policy, starting in 1992 with Cracking Under Pressure, about defects in nuclear submarine reactors. Scottish CND’s giant puppets, CiNDy and Big Sandy. Photograph: John Ainslie/Scottish CND His most recent report, in July, written with Dan Plesch from the University of London, argued that successive UK governments had deceived the public by pretending that Trident was a British bomb when it is actually American. Other reports exposed Trident’s safety flaws, its targeting strategies, and its secret workings. In 2008, he discovered problems with a mysterious top-secret warhead ingredient known as fogbank. He backed Scottish independence as a way of triggering UK nuclear disarmament. In the run-up to the referendum in 2014 he showed how Trident warheads could be removed from the Clyde within two years – and how they could not safely be based anywhere else in the UK. John played a crucial role in breaking the story of the Trident submariner, William McNeilly, who went on the run in 2015 after alleging 30 safety and security flaws. John was a skilled user of freedom of information law, and helped to prise open the MoD’s secretive nuclear citadel and expose its inadequacies. He was a son of the manse, born in Fraserburgh, Aberdeenshire, the sixth child of Emily (nee Peters) and the Rev Duncan Ainslie. After attending high schools in Kirkcaldy and Arbroath, in 1971 he joined the army. He served with the Scottish infantry regiment, the Black Watch, studied international relations at the University of Keele in Staffordshire, and became a junior officer. According to his family and colleagues, he was involved with military intelligence in Northern Ireland, though he never spoke about it. In 1980 he had a big falling-out with the army and resigned his commission, as a conscientious objector. Before he was allowed to leave, he had to argue his case before a tribunal, and to pay back some of his university fees. He then became a youth worker with the Church of Scotland, and studied divinity at the University of Glasgow. He worked for more than five years in the late 1980s as a community minister in Easterhouse, a deprived area of Glasgow. He was appointed coordinator of SCND in 1991.

Many of those in the besieged areas have been living without functioning hospitals or much running water or electricity. They faced a choice of making a last stand or surrendering to the regime’s allied militias, who the UN said had killed civilians in newly reclaimed areas. The departures marked the beginning of the closing chapter of the rebellion in Aleppo.

He said some locals were burning their belongings in their homes so they would not be looted by pro-regime forces. “Most of them are happy they are going out. Some of them are angry they’re leaving their city.

The latest agreement allows for the evacuation of civilians and wounded, as well as rebel fighters bearing small arms, from besieged areas of the city, with Turkey and Russia acting as guarantors. The deal began with a ceasefire at midnight local time in Aleppo. As a concession to Tehran, which is backing the militias spearheading the offensive into Aleppo, wounded civilians will be evacuated from Fua and Kefraya, two Shia villages in the province of Idlib that have been surrounded by rebels for years. Syrian state media said on Thursday that 29 trucks and ambulances were heading to the villages. Sources in east Aleppo said shelling in the city had stopped at midnight local time, but gunfire was reported on Thursday morning before the ICRC said the evacuation had begun. The White Helmets civil defence force, which is based in east Aleppo, said one of its members had been injured by a sniper while clearing an evacuation route and its ambulances in the enclave had come under small-arms fire. Assad is thriving on the west’s hesitation. The time for standing back is over | Ranj Alaaldin Read more The effort to treat and house tens of thousands of civilians, many of whom have had no access to medicine or much food for the past several weeks, is likely to be immense. The Turkish government has said it is prepared to receive the wounded and is readying refugee camps to house as many as 80,000 people in northern Syria and inside Turkey. The aid organisation Mercy Corps said its workers were ready to provide food, blankets, money and other supplies to the civilians arriving in the western countryside of Aleppo, which is under opposition control. Assad hailed the fall of Aleppo as a historic turning point. In a video released by his office, the Syrian president said: “What is happening today is the writing of history.” In a philosophical and whimsical message, he talked about the fall of Aleppo in the context of the birth of Christ and the fall of the USSR. The reclaiming of Aleppo would be of similar historical significance and a key turning point in the conflict, he said. The UK foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, summoned the Iranian and Russian ambassadors to convoy his “profound concern” over the humanitarian crisis, telling them that they had failed to uphold their obligations under international law, specifically by failing to facilitate the delivery of humanitarian aid to civilians during the siege. Facebook Twitter Pinterest John Kerry: Assad regime carrying out nothing short of a massacre in Aleppo “They deserve no credit for the fact that an evacuation appears to be under way today,” Johnson said, adding that it was vital that the UN now oversaw the evacuation process and that all civilians and non-combatants were not punished. Johnson said he was deeply disturbed by reports that some of those being evacuated had been taken away by government forces. Graffiti left by residents in the city for the militias and pro-Assad forces who were expected to enter after their departure highlighted the mixed feelings of those who had to abandon their homes. One message said: “We will return, Aleppo. Our destroyed buildings are a witness of our resistance and your criminality.” Another condemned the destruction meted out by the Assad regime and its allies on east Aleppo: “Under every destroyed building are families buried with their dreams by Assad and his allies.” Additional reporting by Patrick Wintour",diasaster:0},

The film obtained by the Guardian shows Grayling swinging open the door of his ministerial car as it sat in traffic outside the Palace of Westminster and the unfortunate Jaiqi Liu attempted to cycle by. Chris Grayling: Southern rail strike is 'palpable nonsense' Read more Grayling sent Liu flying and his bicycle crashing into a lamppost, leaving him dazed and bruised on the pavement. Liu said his bike sustained a damaged wheel, brakes, mudguard and lost its lights. The transport secretary left his car immediately to speak to the shaken cyclist and check on his wellbeing, apologising and putting a hand on Liu’s shoulders as he sat up on the floor. Liu said he was in shock and became aware of the pain later. “One thing he did say was that I was cycling too fast, which was not true,” Liu said. “That made me really upset. He made out it was my fault.” Passersby recovered the bike. After asking if he was all right, and watching him return slowly to his feet, Grayling shook Liu’s hand. Footage shows that Grayling then left the scene. Liu says he did so without leaving any name or details, less than two minutes after the collision. Liu said he reported the incident, which occurred just before 6pm on 12 October, to the Metropolitan police, still not knowing who had been in the car. Liu, 35, works at the World Bank and is a regular cyclist who has not had an accident before or since. He said he suffered pain to his back, legs and head after the incident. He said that Grayling ignored the state of his bike, which he had to check in for repairs. Liu said: “It’s my first and only accident and it came out of the blue. Definitely he should stay a bit longer to check on me. But maybe he had something more important than this to rush to.” Footage shows Grayling was accompanied by his fellow transport minister Paul Maynard, who left the scene, while Simon Jones, a former Conservative parliamentary candidate and now special adviser to Grayling, is seen watching the scene unfold as he puts his identity badge in his jacket pocket. Liu said he did not expect police to investigate, but he had wanted the incident to be logged in case his injuries proved more serious. “Also,” he said, “I think it’s important to report all these incidents to the police so they are recorded, and they can make the roads safer.” The footage came from a camera mounted on the handlebars of a bike belonging to Laurence de Hoest, a cyclist who was just behind Liu when he was hit. De Hoest, a business analyst, said he was concerned about the conditions cyclists face. “I ride into London every day and I’ve had a couple of close calls,” he said, “so I record everything. This is the minister of transport and here he is swinging his door out.” He added that the incident, which occurred on a stretch of road 20 metres before a cycle lane is restored, showed that “your cycle lane is only as good as your weakest link. We need to make sure they are properly connected”. De Hoest said he was concerned that the transport secretary was insufficiently alert to the risks that his policies, as well as actions, posed. He too was unaware of Grayling’s identity at the time of the incident, but sent the video to the Guardian after seeing the minister in an interview reported in Cycling Weekly earlier this month, where Grayling had complained that cycle lanes in London “cause too much of a problem for road users”. The minister added: “Motorists in London have got to be immensely careful of cyclists.” Liu, having learned who Grayling is, told the Guardian: “And he says cycle lanes are the problem, which makes me angry. If he is still in the position to make cities safer for cyclists, he needs to do something.” A spokesperson for Grayling said: “This was an unfortunate accident. Mr Grayling got out of the car, checked the cyclist was OK and waited until he was back on his feet. Mr Grayling spoke to the cyclist and apologised; they shook hands before he left.”",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Why Spain's hung parliament won't dent the economy … yet", "content": "Spain’s dramatic election result – a hung parliament and a roughly equal split between left and rightwing parties – was followed by only modest drama in financial markets. The Ibex-35 index of leading companies lost 3.6% and the yield on 10-year Spanish bonds rose eight basis points to 1.78%, but these are not big moves in the face of what is being billed as a momentous shift in the political landscape of a large eurozone country. Complacency on the part of investors, or a rational assessment that political uncertainty probably won’t derail an economy forecast to grow by about 3% this year? On balance, the latter. The political map is messy, no doubt about it. Almost any combination of the four leading parties would look unstable. The conservative People’s party of the prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, could form an alliance with newcomer Ciudadanos, from the centre right, but would still fall short of an overall majority. An administration led by the Socialists could enlist the anti-austerity Podemos party but would still need support from pro-independence Catalans. Alternatively, a grand coalition of PP and the Socialists is possible but would not address the apparent message that Spaniards want change. Fresh elections next spring are possible. Spanish elections: what happens next after the unprecedented result? Read more For all that, Spain is not Greece, or even Portugal. The European commission’s latest forecasts suggest growth this year of 3.1% will be followed by 2.7% next year and 2.4% in 2017. If the next government lightens up on austerity, those projections might look more solid, not less. Meanwhile, a low oil price and a weak euro are strongly supportive and the European Central Bank will still be buying Spanish bonds. And, remember, none of the main parties is arguing for an exit from the euro. On the other side of the ledger, official unemployment in Spain stands at the appalling rate of 22% and public debt is roughly 100%. Those factors help to explain why the political landscape is so confused. But to translate a messy election result into a fresh economic crisis, or an automatic slump in inward investment, is a step too far. On day one, markets were right not to panic. Morrisons, a matter of convenience and delivery There was fresh indignity for Morrisons as it departed the FTSE 100 index: its founder and grocery supremo Sir Ken Morrison, a thorn in the side of the former chief executive Dalton Philips, was revealed as the owner of 2.6m shares in Sainsbury’s. His son William is in for 2.1m, meaning the pair have £11.9m backing Sainsbury’s. “It is a well-run company,” Sir Ken told the Times (£). True, and is Sainsbury’s also the company Sir Ken wishes Morrisons could have been? The great man didn’t say that, but it is hard to avoid the contrast between the relative stability at Sainsbury’s and the stop-start strategy pursued by Morrisons in recent years. Morrisons has more than twice as much debt - £2bn at the last count – as it did five years ago when it was taking its first steps in convenience stores and contemplating its online options. The adventure into convenience stores has been abandoned by the new chief executive, David Potts, and the online offer seems to many outsiders to be more beneficial to Ocado, to whom delivery has been outsourced, than to Morrisons. Sainsbury’s, of course, does both convenience and delivery. The difference is that it got into both markets early; with Tesco, it bagged most of the best high street sites. Morrisons, it now appears, came so late to both battles that it should have avoided them altogether and focused on combatting the more potent threat from discounters Aldi and Lidl. That, of course, is roughly what Sir Ken was arguing all along. Keep going, Shell shareholders Get your skates on, Shell shareholders, if you want to lobby the chief executive, Ben van Beurden, to renegotiate the terms of the planned £36bn takeover of BG Group. Even as the price of oil fell to a new 11-year low on Monday, the oil giant took another step towards completing a cash-and-shares deal it negotiated last April when the price of a barrel of Brent was $65, not today’s $36. It set a date for its shareholders to vote – 27 January. Among major fund managers, only David Cumming, head of equities at Standard Life Investments, has gone public with his misgivings, saying last week the takeover “doesn’t make financial sense” at the current oil price. If that is the extent of the rebellion, the deal will glide through. It’s a very odd of state of affairs, though, since BG’s board, if pushed, would surely be obliged to give some ground on the price to reflect changed circumstances. Yet nobody – Cumming apart – seems prepared to turn up the heat. Activism in fund management remains conspicuous by its absence.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Prosecutors indicate they might push on with Greville Janner trial", "content": "The Crown Prosecution Service has indicated that it may seek to press ahead with the “trial of facts” in relation to the child abuse claims against Greville Janner, despite the peer’s death at the weekend. In a statement on Monday, the CPS said it was considering “the procedural implications” of the case and that it would not be commenting further until a court hearing in January. The CPS set out its position only hours after Ken Macdonald, a former director of public prosecutions, said that there was a credible case for carrying on with the “trial of facts” even though Janner, a former Labour peer, died on Saturday. Lord Janner had dementia and it was accepted that he was unfit to stand trial for the alleged sexual abuse of nine boys and men. But, in an unusual move prompted in part by the high level of public interest in the case, there was to be a trial of the facts – a special criminal hearing for suspects unfit to defend themselves in the normal way. In an interview on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme on Monday, Lord Macdonald said that although criminal proceedings normally come to an end when a defendant dies, a trial of the facts was different. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Ken Macdonald. “The whole point of a trial of the facts is that it does not exist to determine the guilt or innocence of anyone,” he said. “There’s no question of a penal sanction at its conclusion. So it doesn’t, I suppose, require the presence of the defendant. In fact, it only takes place when the defendant is incapable of taking part, as Lord Janner unfortunately was.” Macdonald said it was a difficult decision for the current DPP, Alison Saunders. “The argument for continuing is that [Janner] was not going to play any part in these proceedings in any event even if he had not unfortunately died,” he said. But there were also strong arguments for dropping the case, he said. “You would have to acknowledge that part of this process is a culmination of the proceedings in which the court is required to consider some form of disposal, whether it is a hospital order, a discharge, or a supervision order, and none of those is possible in the case of a man who has unfortunately died,” he said. “And that may call into question the whole purpose and legal justification for the proceedings. That is the argument against continuing.” Macdonald said that on balance his preference would be to drop the case. “In the end I think there’s something unseemly about a criminal process to determine the acts of a person who has already died,” he said. “That would be a groundbreaking proceeding, and probably groundbreaking in an unfortunate way.” In its statement, issued in response to questions about whether or not it intended to drop the case, the CPS said: “When a defendant dies during criminal proceedings, it is usual that the case no longer goes ahead following formal confirmation of the defendant’s death at a hearing before the court. “However, we are considering the procedural implications of this specific case. As the high court will close today until January 11 2016, there can be no hearing before that date. “It is right that this matter is considered properly in open court, and we will therefore not be commenting further ahead of a court hearing.” Earlier Liz Dux, a lawyer from Slater and Gordon who is representing six of Janner’s alleged victims, said that her clients would want the trial of the facts to go ahead. Although the Janner allegations are also due to be considered by the Goddard inquiry into child abuse, Dux said her clients were worried this could take too long. The trial of the facts was due to be heard in April, she said. “What they don’t want to see happen is to wait five years to have the opportunity to have their say,” she told the Today programme.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Spain needs broad consensus to go forward after messy election result", "content": "Spaniards wanted change, and at Sunday’s elections they got it. The two discredited parties that have run the country for three decades sank to historic lows while bright newcomers stormed their way into parliament. The upturned two-party system was tired and prone to cronyism, but it had one major advantage: much like Britain, it almost always produced stable governments. Sunday’s vote created an unprecedented mess, with the next government needing the support of up to five different parties. The now acting prime minister Mariano Rajoy began to discover on Monday that, despite his conservative People’s Party gaining most votes, it will be almost impossible for him to form a government and Spaniards were left wondering whether they will have to vote again by May. Spain has been divided not just along left and right lines, but also over visions of how centralist or federalist it should be and, more recently, whether it needs old parties mired in corruption allegations or new squeaky-clean ones. In these conditions it is hard to find common ground between two parties, let alone five. That said, an era of cross-party consensus is what Spain needs as it seeks new models of all kinds, for its political system, its economy and the balance between its regions. Spanish election: national newcomers end era of two-party dominance Read more The most dramatic change is the appearance of anti-austerity Podemos, a party that only 19 months ago placed the pony-tailed profile of its leader, Pablo Iglesias, as its symbol on ballot papers for the European elections because, without it, many voters would not have known who they were. Meanwhile, Albert Rivera’s centre-right Ciudadanos has proved that the high-handedness and blatant cronyism of Mariano Rajoy’s People’s party (PP) was increasingly unbearable to rightwingers and liberals who want a system where power does not bring the right to bend, manipulate or ignore the rules. The breath of fresh air blows in both directions and Podemos should recognise that the desire for regeneration is not a narrow ideological one. Amid all the hype about insurgents and with the PP ahead in the polls, it was easy to ignore the clean-cut but unexciting Socialist leader, Pedro Sánchez. He was clearly leading his party to it worst drubbing in recent history and it duly sank to just 22% of the vote. Yet as Spain wakes up to its most fractured parliament since the restoration of democracy in 1977, Sánchez holds the key to government. Rajoy has the most deputies but if he governs, it must be with the Socialists’ permission. Sanchez made clear on Monday that this will not be forthcoming, so it will be up to him to try stitching together a government backed by Podemos, the communist-led Popular Unity and either Ciudadanos or separatists from Catalonia. If he cannot do that, Spaniards must vote again. Spanish election results graphic A Podemos-backed Sánchez government would open a new anti-austerity breach on Europe’s southern flank, as Spaniards reject a new economic model based on low wages and extreme job instability. Unemployment is still 21% in Spain, and the country’s economy is smaller than it was in 2008. A vote for Podemos was also, in a confused and erratic European Union, a vote for increased sovereignty. Yet Spain is not Greece. Not only has its economy survived without being taken over by the troika – the European Central Bank, European commission and International Monetary Fund – but the eurozone’s fourth largest economy is much harder to bully. The last laugh belongs to separatists in Catalonia. For the first time there is now a large separatist bloc which holds the balance of power between the left and the right. That is, perhaps, the most powerful proof that the status quo is bust. Basques and Catalans have held the balance of power before, backing both Socialist and PP minority governments. But back then the core bloc of Catalans termed themselves “nationalists” – basically regionalists demanding more money and autonomy without leaving Spain – rather than all-out separatists. The rise of separatism, like the rise of Podemos and Ciudadanos, has much to do with Europe and the economy. An electorate that has suffered a double-dip recession and unemployment that peaked at 26% needed hope. Both Podemos and Catalonia’s growing separatists urge their followers to “smile”. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Podemos leader Pablo Iglesias after the results of Spain’s general election were announced in Madrid on Sunday. Photograph: Gerard Julien/AFP/Getty Images Part of the secret of Podemos’ success at these elections was to promise a referendum to Catalans, enabling it to win the race there. This appealed not just to separatists but to many of the majority of Catalans who wish to stay Spanish (support for a referendum is at 80%). On Sunday night Iglesias insisted that Spain was a “plurinational” country and that Catalonia needed special consideration in a rewritten constitution. 'We are in uncharted waters': readers react to the Spanish general election Read more Yet the People’s Party, which tacks right when in opposition, has just enough deputies to block constitutional reform. Agreement has to be truly cross-party, or not at all. In all the heady talk about changing the constitution to enshrine social rights and find a place for Catalonia, however, it is easy to lose sight of the everyday priorities of many Spaniards. They want jobs, preferably secure ones rather than stumbling between short-term, low-pay contracts. This cannot be the long-term model for Spanish growth. Four decades ago Spain surprised the world with a dynamic transition from rightwing dictatorship to democracy, catapulting itself in to the first division of world nations. The edifice built then is crumbling under the weight of abuse by a political establishment of parties, employers groups and trade unions who were handed exaggerated quotas of power to prevent the return of the authoritarians who had imposed their will for four decades. The messy, fractured parliament elected on Sunday is as much an opportunity as a challenge. Politicians are obliged to do two things: talk and reform. Rajoy was right when he said: “It won’t be easy, but difficult times call for real politicians.” If Spain’s politicians can reach broad, long-term agreements on everything from education to Catalonia, Spain’s second transition could start now. That may be too much to hope for. All depends on the calibre of those elected on Sunday.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Home Office dismissed nuclear winter threat as scaremongering, files show", "content": "Threats that civilisation would be devastated by “nuclear winter” after conflict with the Soviet Union were dismissed as scaremongering, according to Home Office files. Officials were more interested in monitoring the activities of campaigners opposed to cruise missiles, documents released by the National Archives in Kew reveal. A confidential file on “Nuclear winter – global atmospheric consequences of nuclear war” shows that civil servants in the department’s emergency planning section, F6, decided they did not need to research the disputed phenomenon. An internal memo in December 1984 records: “It was agreed with F6 that no assessment of the [nuclear winter] theory would be carried out by the branch and as such our interest is limited to general reading which could not be regarded as following the subject in any depth.” The theory predicted that multiple exchanges of nuclear warheads would result in firestorms generating massive black smoke clouds that would rise into the stratosphere, blocking out sunlight and depressing temperatures at ground level around the Earth for months if not years. It had gained popular currency with the release of the US television film The Day After in 1983 and the BBC’s Threads in 1984, both of which dramatised the consequences of a nuclear conflict. After newspaper reports that American scientists had confirmed the hypothesis, MPs who sought advice were provided with a briefing note informing them: “The government believes that the outbreak of war is extremely unlikely and our policy of deterrence is aimed at keeping it that way.” Another Home Office memo records: “This theme has been taken up with enthusiasm by the anti-nuclear movement, which has tended to present the nuclear winter … as accepted scientific fact ignoring important qualifications expressed even by scientists working on the theory. Unfortunately such a presentation has been generally accepted by the public.” Closer attention was paid to anti-nuclear activists. “CND is planning to … recapture its earlier momentum by major campaigns against cruise and Trident in 1985,” the Home Office files note. ”The main focus of its protest activity will switch to RAF Molesworth and will involve increased willingness to use tactics of civil disobedience to disrupt construction work at the site.” Faslane Peace camp, according to one memo, “is reported to be bankrupt”. CND itself, the Home Office, concluded, “is no mere front organisation and there is no evidence of Soviet funding”. The Greenham Common women, it was said, received support from CND and other organisations, “although some are clearly uncomfortable about their strident all-female attitude”. Anti-nuclear groups were under surveillance. “Data is now collected on demonstrations and incidents by anti-nuclear groups at MoD establishments,” the file states. In the battle for public sympathy, pro-nuclear groups received official help. “Continued government support – both financial and through the provision of nuclear PR material – will be necessary,” one report records. “Co-ordination of [their] activities … is best left, in general, to the groups themselves although periodic advice and encouragement from ministers will continue to be valuable.” Architectural drawings of DIY nuclear blast-proof shelters were commissioned for the latest edition of the Protect and Survive pamphlets. They suggested householders excavate holes in their living rooms and build “igloo shelters”; the components cost £554 – about £1,500 in today’s money. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Drawings of a nuclear shelter from the pamphlet Preparations for BBC emergency broadcasting in the event of a war came up against the realisation that it would be difficult to protect transmitters against the destructive effects of electromagnetic pulses caused by nuclear explosions. “The primary purpose of broadcasting to the outside world after a nuclear attack,” one letter remarked, “would presumably be to let the world know that organised society still existed in the UK.” The corporation’s World Service submitted a plan to provide a 24-hour, worldwide service from six sites that would have to be nuclear “hardened”. It included rations for “10,000 man days” and protective clothing. The estimated cost was £15.8m (about £44m now). “Our immediate reaction is that these proposals are based on a much too ambitious specification which we simply cannot afford,” a Foreign Office official responded. A separate memorandum was headed: “Spontaneous evacuation of civil population in a future war.” A weary civil servant observed: “Another hare, the breakdown of public morale in a war emergency and consequent flight from the capital, was let loose. “This is a hoary subject in the civil defence planning world (as opposed to the real world) on a footing with others such as ‘will staff turn up for duty on the day?’ “No one doubts the need to maintain a war effort … If the public is not with the war effort then the war would be loseable without a single nuclear weapon being exploded on England’s green and pleasant land. “The guts of the matter is that in a war emergency a task of the police would be to ensure that, as it does in peacetime (eg peak holiday weekends), that the country does not come to a grinding halt through traffic congestion howsoever caused.”",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Virgin Atlantic pilot lands 447 passengers safely in Gatwick drama", "content": "A Virgin Atlantic plane carrying 447 passengers was forced to make an emergency landing at Gatwick after landing gear problems hit a US-bound flight. Hundreds of holidaymakers applauded in relief after their pilot returned the Boeing 747 to base safely following an unconventional journey that included dumping fuel at sea and flying low over the Gatwick control tower twice so that air traffic controllers could scrutinise the main undercarriage with binoculars. A spokesman for Gatwick airport said that all the passengers had disembarked from the plane – originally headed to Las Vegas – and that “some minor injuries” had been reported. The runway at Britain’s second largest airport was closed for several hours, with incoming flights diverted to alternative airports and departing aircraft delayed as the drama affected the travel plans of thousands of passengers. Sir Richard Branson, the Virgin Atlantic president, praised the crew of flight VS43. In a Twitter posting, he said: “Well done VirginAtlantic pilots & team for safe & skillful landing of VS43. Thoughts with passengers & crew, thanks for support & patience.” Emergency services had been on standby as the giant aircraft came into land. Eyewitnesses reported that the jet was flying at a relatively low altitude, as the pilot appeared to be trying to shake the landing gear down. Describing the mood on the plane, Dan Crane, 24, from Bromsgrove, Worcestershire, said it was “anxious, a lot were worried, some crying. The mood was quiet and [we were] just waiting for the captain’s next announcement.” Facebook Twitter Pinterest A close up of the landing gear of a Virgin Atlantic jumbo jet landing at Gatwick airport after the plane developed a landing-gear fault. Photograph: Gareth Fuller/PA Fellow passenger Holly Jackson said the crew tried to “deliberately bounce” the plane to get the faulty landing gear back into position. She told Sky News: “They said this was a precautionary procedure, or something like that. But it didn’t work and we were told we would have to get into the brace position for a landing and it was then that everybody did start to get scared.” The passengers’ ordeal began four hours previously, when Flight VS43 left for Las Vegas at 11.44am with 447 passengers and 15 crew on board. However, it hit problems before it reached the edge of UK airspace. The pilot had identified a problem with the landing gear, a technical issue that meant one of the five wheel sets would not descend. Instead of completing its transatlantic journey, the plane would, the captain announced, be turning back. Facebook Twitter Pinterest The flight crew are helped to disembark the Virgin Atlantic Boeing 747 at Gatwick airport. Photograph: Jordan Mansfield/Getty Images The vagaries of landing one of the world’s biggest passenger jets meant that fuel had to be dumped en route, to bring it down to the target weight for a safe return. But the pilot was also attempting another part of what Virgin Atlantic termed a “non-standard landing procedure” – hoping the movement of the plane could shake down the landing gear where automation had failed. So began hours of circling around Gatwick and the South Downs, tracing a dense, bright green circle on flight tracking websites and alerting a small army of planespotters. At the airport there came the relatively routine statement that emergency services were on standby “purely as a precaution”. But passengers reported that the mood on the aircraft had changed when the announcement came that there would, after all, be an emergency landing, and that they would have to adopt the brace position. Crane said some passengers had cried. Passenger Mike Kaufman, speaking to Sky News from his seat on the plane back at Gatwick, said: “This was one of the greatest emergency landings in history. It was very smooth.” Facebook Twitter Pinterest Emergency vehicles attend to the Virgin Atlantic Boeing 747 at Gatwick airport.

But, he admitted: “We didn’t realise there would be such a fuss, because it had been such a calm experience. It was probably less dramatic than watching it on the TV.” He said: “The fact everything went so well shows just how professional the flight crew were. The crew were calm. We had a safety briefing two hours before we landed and when we were told we would have to go into the brace position for landings a sigh went around the plane.” He added: “We were talking about going on a rollercoaster ride when we got to Las Vegas. That is off the menu now.” A spokesman for the British pilots’ trade union, Balpa, said: “Pilots train hard for exactly this kind of situation. It goes to show that well-trained pilots are vital.” Chief Superintendent Martin Walker of Sussex police said: “Our co-ordinated partnership response is part of a well-rehearsed emergency procedure. We are delighted that the plane has landed safely and we will continue to support the operation where we’re needed.”",diasaster:0},

The Blinkbox brand is an umbrella for a handful of companies acquired by Tesco over a three-year period: Blinkbox Entertainment, founded by former Channel 4 and Vodafone executives to rival Amazon’s LoveFilm and Netflix; digital book service Mobcast and music streaming service WE7. Together the three businesses lost close to £25m last year, a performance that would be reflected in any deal’s value, according to the Financial Times which first reported the talks. Earlier this month Vodafone was also mooted as a potential suitor and industry experts say the service’s value rests in its relationships with content providers. Telecoms groups are trying to increase the appeal of their broadband, landline and mobile packages. BT, for example, is thrashing out the terms of a deal that will see it swallow mobile phone network EE for £12.5bn. Lewis has promised to update investors on his plans to turn round the retailer when it updates the City on Christmas trading next week. Investors would welcome the disposal of a small business that is viewed as a distraction but are more concerned about how he will strengthen the company’s fragile balance sheet which could involve selling or spinning off bigger assets such as its Asian hypermarket chains or Clubcard operator Dunnhumby.

{ "title":"Just Eat online takeaway service pays £200m for UK rival Hungry House", "content": "The online takeaway food service Just Eat is to spend up to £300m on a buying spree, swallowing up its smaller rivals Hungry House and SkipTheDishes. Just Eat is paying £200m upfront to buy Hungry House, its biggest UK competitor, from the German group Delivery Hero. It has promised to hand over another £40m if the company hits performance targets. “Through this transaction, we would extend our market presence in the UK and sustain high levels of growth given the considerable opportunity in this market,” said Just Eat’s chief executive, David Buttress. Just Eat, which listed in 2014, earns commission on restaurant orders placed via its website and apps. Hungry House, which is the second-biggest player in the UK market after Just Eat, operates a similar model. Just Eat said Hungry House would generate topline operating profits of £12m to £15m in 2017 excluding exceptional integration costs of about £1m. The Hungry House deal will have to be cleared by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA). After initially touching a new high of 623.5p Just Eat shares were down more than 1% at 591.5p by lunchtime. The Jefferies analyst David Reynolds said consolidation was a good thing for online marketplace models, with the purchase of Hungry House removing the possibility of the rival combining with the likes of Deliveroo. “While it may be some time before the CMA bless this deal, the strategic imperative for Just Eat makes sense,” said Reynolds. “We do not underestimate the importance of Just Eat taking Hungry House off the table.” Separately Just Eat announced the acquisition of the fast-growing Canadian outfit SkipTheDishes in a cash and shares deal worth CAD$110m (£66.1m). The business, which has 350,000 customers, is expected to have sales of CAD$23.5m in 2016. It handled 1.6m orders in the 10 months to October, which was up 186% year on year.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"White House says Vladimir Putin had direct role in hacking US election", "content": "The White House on Thursday went its furthest yet in joining the dots between Donald Trump and Russian president Vladimir Putin. Donald Trump risks damaging intelligence agencies, warns former CIA chief Read more Press secretary Josh Earnest indicated that he shared the view of US intelligence officials, reported by NBC News, that Putin had a direct role in hacking during the presidential election. He also argued that Trump knew Russia was engaged in malicious cyber-attacks that boosted him and damaged his rival, Hillary Clinton. But asked directly if the White House believes that Russia successfully rigged the US presidential election, Earnest told reporters “there are a variety of potential explanations” for Trump’s surprise win. It was a question for political analysts, he said, not intelligence analysts. Although there is no evidence that Russians hacked voting machines on election day, intelligence officials have claimed Russians were behind the raid on Clinton campaign chairperson John Podesta’s emails, which were published by WikiLeaks and featured regularly in media coverage of the race. Earnest pointed White House reporters to a unanimous statement from all 17 intelligence agencies, issued in October, that found “only Russia’s senior-most officials could have authorized these activities”. The press secretary said that in his personal view, that sentence was “not intended to be subtle”, adding that it was “pretty obvious that they were referring to the senior-most government official in Russia”. Ben Rhodes, Obama’s deputy national security adviser for strategic communications, agreed in an interview on MSNBC. “I don’t think things happen in the Russian government of this consequence without Vladimir Putin knowing about it,” he said. The Kremlin rejected the claim of Putin’s involvement, spokesman Dmitry Peskov dismissing it as “amusing rubbish that has no basis in fact”, in a conference call with reporters. Despite outward cordiality between Obama and Trump, the issue is straining relations between their teams. Trump himself weighed in on Thursday, using Twitter to ask: “If Russia, or some other entity, was hacking, why did the White House wait so long to act? Why did they only complain after Hillary lost?” Earnest, who normally swerves past Trump’s tweets, noted that the intelligence community had in fact issued its statement on 7 October, a month before polling day. “It was obvious to everyone who was paying attention,” he said, “including the gentleman whose thumbs authored that tweet, that the impact of that malicious activity benefited the Trump campaign and hurt the Clinton campaign. “That is, after all, why the president-elect called on Russia to hack Secretary Clinton’s email. “That is presumably why the coverage of the hack-and-leak operation that Russia carried out was focused on emails from the Democratic party and Clinton campaign staffers and not the Republican party and Trump campaign staffers.” He added: “That is why, in the day leading up to election day, the Republican nominee himself was encouraging people to check out WikiLeaks. He thought it would help his campaign. “And he knew that when people went to WikiLeaks, they weren’t going to find damaging information about [his allies] Steve Bannon or Reince Priebus or the RNC [Republican National Committee].” Donald Trump to Russia: hack and publish Hillary Clinton's 'missing' emails Read more At his last press conference, in July, Trump effectively asked a foreign power to carry out cyber-espionage, entreating Russia to find Clinton’s 30,000 “missing” emails, from the private server she used while secretary of state. His aides have since claimed he was joking, but Earnest said pointedly on Thursday: “I don’t think anybody at the White House thinks it’s funny that an adversary of the United States engaged in malicious cyber activity to destabilise our democracy. “That’s not a joke.” Later on Thursday, Trump launched a brazen attack on Earnest at a post-election rally in Hershey, Pennsylvania, branding him “foolish” and speculating, without evidence, that he might be “taking orders from someone else”. At the rally, Trump moved to stop the boisterous crowd booing when he mentioned Obama’s name, waving his hand and saying, “No, no, no!” But then, seemingly as a fresh thought occurred to him, he digressed: “Although this foolish guy, Josh Earnest, I don’t know if he’s talking to President Obama. You know, having the right press secretary’s so important because he is so bad, the way he delivers a message. “He can deliver a positive message and it sounds bad. He could say, ‘Ladies and gentlemen, today we have totally defeated Isis,’ and it wouldn’t sound good, OK, all right? I have a feeling they won’t be saying it but we will be saying it.” The crowd cheered. The Republican nominee added: “The president’s very positive but he’s not positive and I mean, maybe he’s getting his orders from somebody else. Does that make sense? Could that be possible?” Although Obama and Trump have been studiously polite about each other, their lieutenants seem to be taking the gloves off. Trump aide Kellyanne Conway, who is said to have turned down the job of press secretary, described Earnest’s criticism as “breathtaking”. She told Fox News: “I guess he’s auditioning to be a political pundit after his job is over soon. That is incredibly disappointing to hear from the podium of the White House press secretary.” But David Axelrod, a former senior adviser to Obama, said it was “highly unlikely” Earnest was acting without the president’s approval. “A press secretary doesn’t go out and make statements like that on an unauthorised basis,” he told CNN.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Better Capital supremo shows humane side with City Link failure apology", "content": "There is an A to Z of private equity jargon on the website of Jon Moulton’s company, Better Capital. U is for unions, the “greatest ally” of private equity firms, it says. “Particularly helpful in restructuring dying businesses to meet the needs of the market economy. We are all capitalists now.” It is perhaps a reflection of the lighter side of the outspoken 64-year-old, who apologised on Monday for the Christmas collapse of City Link, the delivery business which his firm bought last year for £1. The RMT union is now battling to save the jobs of 2,000 workers. In three decades of buying and selling companies that have helped him amass an estimated £100m fortune, Moulton has become best known for the deal he failed to pull off – the acquisition of the troubled car company Rover in 2000. Bought by John Towers’s Phoenix, Rover then became embroiled in controversy over payments to its rescuers. Moulton got a taste of what was to become a lucrative career in private equity while working in Liverpool as a trainee accountant on companies going bust. Accountancy was not his first choice of profession; he might have been a scientist, having set up a laboratory in the family garden shed in Stoke when he was child. He has described himself as being a sickly child - including suffering from aplastic anaemia, a disease of the bone marrow. His father was a master engraver in the local pottery industry and Moulton has said that this grandfather – who ran his own engineering business – was his mentor. After a false start at Aberystwyth University, Moulton did his degree at Lancaster and joined Coopers accountants – now part of PricewaterhouseCoopers – before a stint in New York. His break into private equity came when he set up Schroders Ventures, later to become Permira, before setting up Alchemy in 1997 after a brief period at Apax. It was while at Alchemy that he tried to bid for MG Rover, and at one point proved prescient when he warned in 2006 that the economy was overheating and heading for crisis. He walked out of Alchemy in 2009, a year before he was due to retire, after falling out with his anointed successor. His resignation letter ended with the words: “I’d do it again, but better.” The phrase reportedly provided the name for his latest firm, set up in 2010. It has a range of investments including the recently-acquired Walkabout drinks chain, the Everest double glazing business and the high-end fashion brand Jaeger which its former boss Harold Tillman is said to be trying to buy back. Moulton is now based in Guernsey and told the Financial Times that he can still get up at 6am and be in London by 8.55am each day. “The government provides the same services as the UK but without a deficit and much less tax. Life expectancy exceeds the UK and unemployment is very low,” he said. Moulton has been a donor to the Conservative party in the past.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Plantwatch: Leaves versus the tide", "content": "The storms this month brought back memories of a year ago when the biggest storm surge for 60 years battered the East Coast and flooded land and houses. The cry went out for more manmade sea defences, but these are not the only protection. Salt marshes are the unsung heroes of coastal flood protection. These flat expanses of wild plants grow in muddy channels and creeks, flooded and drained by the tides. Only special types of plants can tolerate this briny environment, such as the pretty purple flowers of sea aster and sea lavender, and the spiky shoots of marsh samphire, much loved as a vegetable with fish dishes. These plants have evolved ingenious ways to cope with the saltwater, such as packing away the toxic salt into special glands. And although salt marshes may look unglamorous, they are home for all sorts of worms, insects, shellfish, fish and wild birds. Salt marshes can also help to hold back storm surges by absorbing energy from the tides and waves. A recent study found that salt marshes can slash the height of storm waves by nearly 20%, and even when the plants are battered by waves, the muddy soil underneath remains remarkably resistant to the onslaught. Land needs to be sacrificed to create new salt marshes though, and after centuries of reclaiming the marshes for farmland, that sacrifice is often difficult to accept. But as the climate continues to warm and sea levels carry on rising, every defence will be needed to hold back the tide.",diasaster:0},

It was indeed the defining image of the 2014-1914 commemorations. But none of it would have happened without the assistance of the skilled potters of Stoke-on-Trent. All of the 497,000kg of clay used for the project – a slightly sanded, red earthenware – was supplied or sourced by the Etruria-based Potclays company. Help with the firing regime, kiln space, slab rollers, and production came from a range of Potteries businesses. Drawing on hundreds of years of ceramic skills, these world-class designers, technicians and manufacturers were honoured to work with Paul Cummins on his inspirational vision.

{ "title":"Cabinet papers show Thatcher advisers’ ‘struggle’ with Heseltine over Westland", "content": "The open hostility between Margaret Thatcher’s Downing Street and Michael Heseltine at the height of the Westland affair is laid bare in newly released cabinet papers from 1985 and 1986. They show how Thatcher’s two closest advisers plotted against the then defence secretary, talking about his “game plan” and his “new trick” and of getting intelligence from a “friend” within Heseltine’s Ministry of Defence. The two Downing Street files released by the National Archives on Tuesday show that Thatcher’s foreign policy adviser, Charles Powell, and press secretary, Bernard Ingham, considered themselves to be involved in what they openly referred to as a struggle with Heseltine and that they kept her informed every step of the way. The papers on the Westland affair also show that Heseltine made clear to Thatcher that he would resign over Westland before he quit by walking out of a cabinet meeting on 7 January 1986. The warnings may explain how Thatcher was able within half an hour to replace Heseltine with George Younger as defence secretary and resume the cabinet meeting. They also show that at the height of the affair, Heseltine even went as far as to claim that a previously unknown Libyan involvement in the American consortium bidding to takeover the West Country helicopter company could inflict “grave embarrassment to the national interest”. But six crucial No 10 files dating from January 1986 which could contain the “smoking gun” of the Westland affair have been temporarily withheld. They are expected to detail the role of Thatcher and her closest advisers at the time of the leak of the solicitor-general’s letter and the subsequent resignation of Leon Brittan from the cabinet. A National Archives spokesman said it is intended they will be available in the near future. The Westland affair was ostensibly about a struggle in government over whether a US-led Sikorski-Fiat consortium or a European-led Agusta consortium should take over Britain’s last remaining helicopter company. It was to prove a major power struggle between Thatcher and Heseltine and her moment of greatest political danger until she was eventually brought down in 1990. At one point just before a crucial Commons debate on the affair, she confessed to friends: “I may not be prime minister by 6pm tonight.” Powell constantly kept Thatcher in the loop, telling her in one typical note: “Although not strictly for your eyes, you might like to glance at this helpful account of the lengths to which the MoD are going.” In another note, Powell reports that “inquiries of my friend in the MoD” confirm that Heseltine had lunched that day with political journalist Tony Bevins, that the MoD believed Brittan has misled the Commons, that Jim Prior’s GEC would put in extra cash, and that if the European consortium had not won by 27 December, Heseltine would cancel his holiday to Nepal. He did. The file shows the first warning to Thatcher was delivered indirectly on 23 December with her parliamentary private secretary, Michael Alison, reporting that Heseltine had given Lord Fanshawe, a former pro-European Tory MP and a Westland director, the impression that he would resign if the European option was not adopted following his “humiliation” in cabinet. The second warning came in the form of a handwritten letter to Thatcher from Heseltine himself on the same day following a note in which he raised the security problem posed by a 13% minority Libyan shareholding in Fiat and the presence of two Libyans on its board, and a third in its senior executive team. Heseltine said he had asked the joint intelligence chiefs to report on the security implications of something “which could cause grave embarrassment to the government” and urged her to support the rival European bid. “I know that the last sentence of my note will not be an easy one for you. I also think that you will understand the depth of my convictions on this matter,” he told her. Thatcher’s aides dismissed the Libyan angle, telling the PM that: “The Americans are even more sensitive about both security and Libya than we are. They seem content for Fiat to be involved with Sikorski.” The file also reveals one previously unknown bizarre twist in the Westland tale: earlier in 1985 an order for 12 helicopters “to tackle elephant poachers’’ was mooted by Kenneth Kuanda’s Zambia to save Westland helicopters from going bust. This move, which was initiated at the suggestion of the controversial businessman “Tiny” Rowland, was firmly rejected in Downing Street saying it would provoke a major overseas aid scandal as it was to be financed by 100% grants from Britain’s overseas aid budget.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"NHS out-of-hours care is out of cash, out of luck", "content": "My father started out as a single-handed GP, was on call 24/7 and would know all of his patients. Sleepless nights reduced to one in three as other doctors joined his surgery. Then two surgeries combined to share on-call duties between around 14 doctors, but they would still know most of the unwell patients. Across the UK, out-of-hours provision was provided by similar-sized GP co-operatives. The 2004 GP contract did not provide GP surgeries with adequate funding for out-of-hours service provision. Consequently, this shifted to larger providers. These days, in an attempt to create economies of scale, out-of-hours services cover even larger geographical areas, with contracts given to private providers. GPs, as shift-workers, visit patients who they have probably never met before and will never meet again. Over Christmas I did several out-of-hours shifts in Hampshire. The waiting times for home visits were often in excess of 12 hours (the “target” is six). The majority of these patients were frail and elderly, vulnerable and often unable to speak out. In one tragic case I was greeted by the patient’s grieving son and daughter. She had called the out-of-hours service 12 hours previously, complaining of breathing problems; by the time I arrived, her body had already been taken to the undertakers. Service pressures over the Christmas period are entirely predictable.As an insider, I can see under-resourced out-of-hours services having a knock-on effect on ambulances and hospitals. There is an urgent need for adequately funded, local and responsive out-of-hours services, run by GPs providing care for patients in their local area. Dr Chris Smith London • Why does Francis Maude (Health mutuals are not private firms, Letter, 26 December) continue to deny a Tory agenda of NHS privatisation? In doing so, he contradicts his fellow Cabinet Office minister Oliver Letwin, who defines privatisation in his 1988 book, Privatising the World, as: outsourcing public sector services to private sector companies; deregulation of public sector monopolies; and “trade sales” into the private sector of public sector bodies deemed to be “failing”. Reform of the NHS so far satisfies all of Letwin’s privatisation criteria, so this should not be in any doubt. More doubtful are the prospects for any of Maude’s envisioned “mutuals” in the non-free-market environment of NHS tendering. Maude should know better than most that social enterprises – which are companies, not public sector bodies – won’t last two shakes of a reindeer’s tail trying to compete with international healthcare giants looking for business in the UK. Social enterprises for community services – once taken out of the public sector – have already lost out in a big way to the likes of Virgin, resulting in another set of NHS services permanently lost to the public sector. At this point in the argument, ministers tend to resort to claiming “it’s up to GP-led clinical commissioning groups to decide who gets awarded contracts”. Aggressive and expensive litigation by private providers claiming that they were unfairly denied NHS contracts, together with the stringencies of EU competition law, mean that CCGs’ hands are too tightly tied and it is the market that decides instead. There is no free market in health. The direction of travel is one-way, stepwise, towards privatisation under foreign healthcare giants who want into UK business. Dr Nick Mann (GP) London • There is no need to spin off large chunks of the NHS into not-for-profit mutual firms. There is a long track record of mutuals being bought/taken over/converted into commercial firms, often fuelled by large debts. This has made a few individuals very rich while those who work in the ex-mutuals get poorer pay and pensions, and frequently redundancies. The ill now leave hospital not as patients but as clients whose continuity and coordination of care become difficult. It does not serve them well. Fragmentation of services is a result of political ideology and, frankly, a deceit. Mr Maude will surely remember the enthusiasm for the conversion of mutual building societies into plcs. Dr James Chang Cheadle Hulme, Cheshire • Despite the mandatory mild scepticism, you are still taken in by the flashy big science and personalised medicine rhetoric of the “genomics revolution” (Editorial, 23 December). Some revolution: it’s been running 30 years, and the UK still has the worst common adult cancer outcomes among comparable countries, with no evidence of improvement relative to the others. Countless have died prematurely because we cannot deliver the same level of conventional care as Canada or Australia. How spending £300m on the luxury of the 100,000 genome project is practically going to help anyone isn’t easy to understand. It may uncover or refine diagnoses in the 70% of subjects with rare genetic conditions, but that’s of little consolation when we have only vague and distant potential of treatments (which are always a decade away). As to the dilemma, give £150m to cancer treatment now, the rest to fund more paramedics and ambulance personnel, and put the genomics revolution on hold until the NHS has stopped falling apart.

{ "title":"Thatcher considered UK chemical weapons programme, documents show", "content": "Margaret Thatcher considered restarting Britain’s chemical weapons (CW) programme at a cost of up to £200m in response to Soviet threats, Downing Street correspondence reveals. The prime minister, by training a research chemist, acknowledged that the government might be considered negligent for failing to acquire a “retaliatory capability” at the height of the cold war. Secret papers canvassing the military options available have emerged from a Home Office file, released on Tuesday by the National Archives in Kew, which contains warnings that airborne chemical attacks by Soviet aircraft on sensitive UK targets could inflict massive loss of life. One civil defence paper estimated that up to 140,000 people could be injured and more than 20,000 killed if Liverpool’s dockyards were hit by lethal gases. If Gatwick was struck, medical modelling suggested, there would be about 30,000 casualties and 16,000 dead. The UK had ratified the Geneva protocols in 1930, which banned the use of toxic gases and bacteria in war. But the treaty did not outlaw development or production of such weapons of mass destruction and permitted their use in retaliation. The communist bloc’s expanding stockpile of nerve agents alarmed Ministry of Defence planners who warned that there was no military response short of escalating directly to nuclear conflict. “Any significant step … to improve our retaliatory capability will involve serious political and presentational difficulties,” a secret policy document admitted. Saddam Hussein’s use of sarin and other toxic agents in the Iran/Iraq war was seen as helpful in alerting the public to the threat. In February 1984, the prime minister attended a CW briefing in the chief of staff’s room at the MoD along with the defence secretary, then Michael Heseltine, senior army and intelligence officers and the government’s chief scientific adviser. “Nato has no capability to retaliate in kind, although the Americans have a small stockpile not declared to Nato,” civil servants reported. “The threat of nuclear retaliation in response to a chemical attack is our only deterrent and is not credible in all circumstances. “MoD are currently considering proposals for issuing … protective suits to UK-based servicemen and essential supporting staff. There is however little public awareness of the threat outside official circles, no civil defence plans are yet made against chemical weapons and no formal guidance has been issued.” Another note recorded: “Chemical warfare is likely to be an emotional issue and any increase in public awareness is, if possible, best delayed until the general public can be given credible guidance on protection measures.” Problems were anticipated. A policy document rated “Secret UK Eyes A” said: “A sharp turn in HMG’s policy on CW basing or acquisition, after 25 years of no direct involvement with such weapons, will provoke political controversy just when the public debate over the basing of cruise missiles is showing signs of declining. “A unilateral UK move would create even starker problems of domestic and international presentation, particularly if such action were to contrast with continued congressional reluctance to fund modernisation.” It observed that the military chiefs of staff believed the only effective and credible deterrent to Soviet use of chemical weapons was “the ability to retaliate in kind”. Among retaliatory options proposed were offering “practical support to the US administration by permitting the forward basing of US delivery systems and storage of CW in this country in time of tension or even in peacetime. A variation would be to offer to provide delivery systems ourselves … “Finally there is the option of acquiring an independent UK retaliatory capability, based perhaps on American technology. The cost would be of the order of £100m to £200m. Such a decision would be a last resort should all other options fail.” The file does not record the final outcome of deliberations but a letter from Charles Powell, Thatcher’s private secretary in Downing Street, recorded the outcome of a further, senior ministerial summit on chemical weapons in August that year. The following decision had been made, Powell informed the permanent secretary at the MoD: “Modern NBC [nuclear, biological or chemical] equipment should be issued to servicemen and essential civilians in British forces Germany and to some 140,000 servicemen in the UK with a Nato role.” He added: “The Americans should be encouraged to move forward with modernisation of their capability … Public opinion in the UK could be brought gently to a better and wider perception of the imbalance between Soviet and Nato capabilities in chemical warfare while avoiding an upsurge of alarm.” Assessing whether the UK should acquire an independent CW capability, attention was drawn to the drawback that “it might undermine the broader support which had been built up recently in public opinion for the UK’s role as a nuclear power. “Summing up the discussion, the prime minister said that it might be argued that it was negligent of the government not to acquire a CW capability. But this was not a decision which could be addressed at this stage. Further discussions should be held with the Americans to discover more of their intentions and to encourage them to modernise their CW capability. These discussions should be on a bilateral basis rather than involving other Allies who were unlikely to have similar views.” The UK did not sign the chemical weapons convention, by which participating countries agreed to destroy all CW capability, until 1993.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"FTSE 100: a world of changes 15 years after the peak", "content": "When on 30 December 1999 the FTSE 100 index closed at an all-time high of 6930.2, it did not make the next morning’s front pages. At the time, it felt like nothing special – just another high for an index that, like its main US equivalents, had been setting records for months. Trading volumes had been thin, noted the Guardian in its report on page 21, because most investors were sitting on their hands to see if something called the millennium bug would throw the world’s computers into chaos as the year turned. On the final day of 1999, a Friday, stock markets were to remain closed just in case. At the level of individual stocks, market reports of the day also read as if from another world. Royal Bank of Scotland and Bank of Scotland, locked in a takeover battle for NatWest, were being closely watched. Shares in Marconi, half of GEC, rose 54p to £10.96 on the now-famous day. Baltimore Technologies, another dotcom darling, hit a new high. Unpopular stocks of the time included Anglo-Dutch cleaning products group Reckitt Benckiser, fresh from a profits warning, and perennial plodder Associated British Foods. Brewer Whitbread, it was noted, had almost halved in value in 12 months. Life was about to change for all those companies and for the FTSE 100 index. The talked-about level of 7000 never arrived. The dotcom bubble burst in 2000, and 2001 brought the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the US. By mid-March 2003, as coalition forces gathered to prepare for the invasion of Iraq, the index had fallen to 3,287. Having since then gone through a sharp recovery (2003-2007) and a financial crash (2008-09), the main index this year once again recalled 1999’s high but without quite getting there. It came within 100 points during three months of 2014 (February, May and September) and was nearly 300 points adrift of that millennial peak last night. Whether it will get there in 2015 is anybody’s guess, but the question needs to be put in context. The current standing of the FTSE 100 does not mean that the market has taken 15 years to retrace most of its steps. The missing ingredient is dividend income. Laith Khalaf, an analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, calculated that a person who had invested £10,000 in the FTSE 100 on 30 December 1999 – in other words, at the worst possible time – would now be sitting on slightly more than £15,000 if he or she had reinvested dividends. A 50% return over 15 years is poor but it’s not zero. If your investment horizons are broader than the FTSE 100, your performance ought to have been better. Khalaf’s calculations show that a sum of £10,000 invested on the same day in the FTSE 250 index, containing the next 250 largest companies with a main market listing in London, would now be worth about £24,000, or slightly more than £36,000 with dividends reinvested. Another point to remember is that the FTSE 100 reflects nothing other than the share prices of its constituent members, which are reviewed quarterly. It is not, and never was, a barometer of the health of UK plc. Aside from the banks, the index is dominated by multinationals, most of which make a small fraction of their sales in the UK. The expanded crew of miners – led by BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto – are not here to look for iron ore. The real moral of the tale is to pick your stocks carefully. Of those companies mentioned in the contemporaneous market reports, Baltimore disappeared in no time. Marconi, having paid for its disastrous top-of-the-market telecoms purchases in cash rather than shares, stumbled from disaster to disaster. Success in the NatWest battle did not halt Royal Bank of Scotland, but its next big purchase, ABN Amro in 2007, did. By then, Bank of Scotland had been shunted into HBOS, the other great British banking disaster-in-the-making. On the other side of the ledger, that trio of 1999 laggards became fortune-makers. AB Foods discovered a gem within its midst called Primark and became a sprinter rather than a plodder; its share price has travelled from 340p to £32.11. Reckitt Benckiser found focus and cost savings and has gone from 650p to £52.15. Whitbread gave up brewing to concentrate on Costa Coffee and Premier Inn; its shares have risen from 600p to £47.26 this century.

{ "title":"UK buyers need to save for up to 24 years to get on housing ladder", "content": "Homebuyers now have to save for up to 24 years to set aside a deposit large enough to buy them a foot on Britain’s housing ladder, according to new research. The Resolution Foundation thinktank has used the Bank of England’s latest survey of household finances to show that with house prices rising sharply, it would now take almost a quarter of a century for low- and middle-income households to accumulate a deposit on average, if they set aside 5% of their disposable income each year. It is lower than the peak reached before the financial crisis, but dramatically higher than the three years that was the norm in the 1980s and 1990s – and comes despite interest rates remaining at the emergency level of 0.5% set by the Bank of England in the depths of recession. George Osborne has introduced a series of help-to-buy policies, including shared ownership schemes and taxpayer guarantees for mortgages for first-time buyers, and pledged in his spending review last month to “turn generation rent into generation buy”. Facebook Twitter Pinterest How long does it take savers to accumulate a deposit? Photograph: Resolution Foundation But Resolution’s chief economist, Matt Whittaker, warned that help to buy may simply boost house prices, lifting them further out of the reach of lower-income households. “To the extent that these schemes have stoked demand and so propped up house prices in recent years, they have served to make homeownership even less attainable for many, while increasing the gains flowing to older homeowners who have been the main beneficiaries of the sustained housing boom,” he said. Resolution said it is concerned that the rising cost of homeownership is exacerbating a generational divide, which has seen the baby boomer generation accumulate a financial cushion, while younger workers have struggled as wages have been squeezed. Its analysis of the Bank’s data shows that among households headed by under-45s, 28% of non-homeowners say they do not think they will ever manage to buy. Among the poorest fifth of households, the figure rises to 39%. Ashley Seager, co-founder of the Intergenerational Foundation thinktank, which campaigns for a better deal for younger households, said: “Today’s wealthy baby boomers found it easy to buy housing a generation or two ago, especially as MIRAS tax relief on mortgages was available to them. But now their children and grandchildren cannot access housing in anything like the same way.” He welcomed the chancellor’s recent crackdown on the buy-to-let market, which has restricted the tax relief landlords can claim, with the aim of levelling the playing field with owner-occupiers. The Bank of England’s financial policy committee, which has been given the task of preventing future financial crises, has also warned that it is becoming increasingly concerned about whether buy-to-let borrowers are fuelling an unsustainable boom. Osborne is currently consulting about whether to hand the FPC new powers over buy to let, which could see the supply of mortgages dry up, even if the Bank’s base rate remains at zero.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Netflix paid no corporation tax despite 4.5m UK subscribers, report claims", "content": "Netflix paid no UK corporation tax last year despite being estimated to have around 4.5m subscribers in the country, it has been reported. The video streaming service behind award-winning series such as Orange is the New Black and House of Cards charges customers a minimum of £5.99 a month to subscribe and has grown rapidly since its UK launch in 2012. According to a Sunday Times investigation, it generated an estimated £200m of revenue in Britain last year but any profits from the UK in 2014 were booked overseas. There is no suggestion that Netflix has broken the law. Can broadcast TV match streaming’s big budget shows? Read more The paper reported that latest accounts for Netflix International BV, which was based in Luxembourg until the end of last year, show a net turnover of £415m and profits of £11.3m in 2014, with British customers accounting for the largest proportion of turnover. It says the company paid income tax in Luxembourg of £573,396, equivalent to a rate of about 5%. The company says it is in “expansion” mode and is making overall losses on its international operation. A spokesman said its British subsidiary employs about 12 people and will pay some corporation tax this year, adding: “We are fully compliant with all applicable rules.” In July, it was reported that despite having more than 65m subscriptions worldwide the cost of third-party content on Netflix was $7.7bn (£5.2bn), about 4.6 times its net revenue. Earlier this month, Mondelez, which owns Cadbury, was reported to have paid zero UK corporation tax last year. By contrast, Starbucks, which was widely criticised over corporate tax avoidance in 2012 following details of its meagre tax contribution, revealed last week it has paid £8.1m corporation tax this year, nearly as much as it paid in its first 14 years in the UK, after bowing to pressure to scrap its complex tax structures. The UK is believed to be Netflix’s biggest market outside the US, where it has more than 40m subscribers, with the number of British subscribers predicted to reach 9.5m by the end of the decade. The company has been facing increasing competition from rival streaming services such as Amazon, Hulu and HBO in the US. In the UK, Amazon Prime is Netflix’s closest rival.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"We all love Marks & Spencer – but not enough to buy its clothes", "content": "One of Margaret Thatcher’s great heroes was Lord Sieff, the last of the Marks & Spencer dynasty. These days, M&S is perceived as being in trouble. Its Christmas sales results will be anxiously analysed. Its share price will ricochet up and down. This is a huge global empire, with a turnover of £10.3bn and profits before tax of more than £600m. But it no longer bestrides the high street the way it did when it was run by Sieff. Sieff wasn’t just a shopkeeper, a cigar-smoking impresario who took the family business to new peaks of retail victory. He was also a backer of the Conservative Philosophy Group whose ideas framed Thatcherism. In return, she bought Denis’s supper at her local M&S and considered Sieff One of Us. He looked to Thatcher to make Britain profitable again. In the aftermath of the Brighton bomb she turned to M&S to get a new outfit. M&S was the perfect setting for Thatcher’s political personality. But it was more than that. Its story is a rags-to-riches fairytale of refugees, hardship, tragedy (both Marks and Spencer died young) endeavour and triumph. Seiff was Marks’s grandson. During the second world war M&S staff clubbed together and paid for a Spitfire. It’s hard to think of a more effective way of buying into modern Britain’s foundation myth. It was good for Thatcher, and the Thatcher years were the magic and sparkle years for M&S. The brand was a byword for Britishness and British-made quality goods. It was the place where the customer was always, but always, right. If you could produce the receipt you could return the goods, no matter how long ago you bought them. It took no credit cards. Borrowing! Pfff! It had nearly 50,000 employees, no trade unions, a workers’ profit-sharing scheme, and chiropody as part of the contract. But M&S created its own force-field so successfully that it failed to notice how fast the world was changing. The industry has many theories about what went wrong after peak magic and sparkle in 1997, but they all point the same way. The world changed, and M&S didn’t, or at least not enough. And maybe it can’t. Not that it is all doom and discount sales. Food does brilliantly and home is doing OK. It’s the clothes that are the problem. A real problem. Clothes are still almost half the business, and at least three-quarters of the store’s identity, but a trip to any M&S clothes department is a magnificent explanation of why they don’t make money. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Twiggy, centre, and Lisa Snowdon were among those recruited to help try to boost M&S sales. Photograph: Bloomberg/Bloomberg via Getty Images It’s not bras and knickers or socks and tights. They’re as good as ever. It’s the outerwear. Pinning down just what it is that is wrong is notoriously hard, which is why so many buyers have come, talked confidently about the market and “Our Customer”, and then gone again, with sales still inching south. On one level, it’s pretty obvious that there are just not enough people out there yearning for a coat in royal blue and black, or a baby pink fluffy sweater, or even a fur-lined parka quite like the ones Zara was selling earlier this year. But really, most of the items on their own – or on Twiggy or Rosie Huntington-Whiteley – would be more or less wearable at least if, say, someone had lobbed a cup of coffee over you, or you had been the victim of a drive-by ketchup-squirting incident. You might want to avoid the odd bit of sparkle; and has anyone, anywhere, bought the T-shirt with “On the naughty list” inscribed leeringly across the chest? Apart from that, you could walk out wearing Marks & Sparks and feel no worse than a bit dull. No, the clothes aren’t at the heart of the matter. It’s Our Customer, the one who is always right, that is the problem. That is because the M&S customer barely exists any more. Our Customer belongs to another era. She belongs to the age of common endeavour, where no one thought twice about picking a pair of black slacks off a rack containing 32 other pairs of identical black slacks, or singling out a blouse available in many sizes and plainly unlimited quantities. Our Customer valued good quality at a sensible price more than she valued fashion or individuality. She did not expect to have her character assessed on the basis of her outfit, or if she did then value for money seemed like a good judgment to earn. But now the retail business model is to turn over cheap stock fast to customers with not a lot of cash and a bottomless yearning for something new. The clothes are made in sweatshops in Bangladesh or Mexico, the warehouse staff are on zero-hours contracts, and the shop workers are on the minimum wage. The M&S mid-market recipe of good value and nothing too scary works brilliantly with food, but it’s a dud in fashion. The winners belong to the globalised economy. M&S first made clothes in 1926, the year of the general strike. It made the utility dress in the 1940s, about the time that Muriel Spark first came to London – the time when, she later wrote, all the nice people were poor. By the time Thatcher met Sieff in the 1970s, when the gap between rich and poor was narrower than it had ever been, it was the unchallenged king of the high street. Many of us yearn for Marks & Spencer to succeed again, and not only because it’s become woven into the national story. It’s a legacy brand, a survivor of an age when shoppers were frugal and a new coat came once every 10 years or so. It’s a symbol of a better world. We want it to be a success, but we really, really don’t want to buy our clothes there.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"BBC postpones broadcast of film about Prince Charles’s former spin doctor", "content": "The broadcast of a BBC documentary exploring the controversial tactics of Prince Charles’s former spin doctor Mark Bolland has been postponed after intervention from lawyers representing the royal family. The BBC2 documentary, titled Reinventing the Royals, promised an in-depth examination of the shrewd PR tactics used by Bolland to boost Charles’s public appeal after the death of Diana, Princess of Wales in 1997. Written and presented by the former editor of Panorama Steve Hewlett, who has also contributed articles to the Guardian, the two-part series was made without the involvement or co-operation of Clarence House or Buckingham Palace. The first episode was due to air on Sunday 4 January. The documentary is understood to have been cleared by BBC lawyers, the corporation’s editorial policy team and at the highest level of management. However, it is understood the transmission was put on hold after a the BBC received a letter from representatives of Charles and his wife, the Duchess of Cornwall. According to the Radio Times, which is due to publish a piece by Hewlett about the documentary, the last-minute decision to postpone the broadcast was made by the head of BBC news and current affairs, James Harding. Separately, it is understood that issues remain in getting clearance for some archive footage featuring members of the royal family. There is said to be an ongoing dialogue between the BBC and representatives of the royal family, with the corporation still intending to broadcast the series at a later date. The documentary explores how Bolland, once described as “the real power behind the future king of England”, was the cause of much animosity among fellow staff members and other royals until he severed links with the palace in early 2003. It will feature a series of interviews with figures such as journalists Tom Bradby and Richard Kay and the press secretary to Prince Charles at the time of Diana’s death, Sandy Henney. Writing in the Radio Times, Hewlett quotes one royal commentator who described Bolland as a genius at pulling strings and manipulating the press, but said he was called “Blackadder” by Princes William and Harry. The documentary will explore how William and Harry were part of Bolland’s agenda to win back public favour for Charles and Camilla. This is not the first time issues have arisen between the BBC and the palace over a documentary relating to the royal family. Footage of the Queen edited in non-chronological order caused the Crowngate controversy in 2007. A trailer shown to journalists for the BBC fly-on-the-wall documentary Monarchy: The Royal Family at Work created the false impression that the Queen had walked out of a photo shoot with Annie Liebovitz after being asked to remove her crown. The ensuing row led to a formal apology from the BBC to the Queen and the resignation of the BBC One controller Peter Fincham. A royal communications spokesman said of Reinventing the Royals: “Scheduling is a matter for the BBC.” The BBC said it was delaying broadcast “until later in the new year while a number of issues including the use of archive footage are resolved”.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Why the North Korea-US hacking row could help clear the air", "content": "The glorious truth about diplomatic openings is that fact can trump fiction for strangeness. Take the Bible and the key-shaped cake that a former US national security adviser took to Iran when embarking on the Iran-Contra deal. Or, 15 years before, the convoluted route via Pakistan by which Henry Kissinger arrived in Beijing to prepare the way for Richard Nixon’s historic trip. Could the fantastical tale of Sony, its hackers and the North Korean leader one day be seen as an unintended patch of darkness that hastened the dawn? However comical or satirical the tone, it was probably not a good idea for Sony to commission a film with the assassination of a real-life leader as its subject. Even in easygoing Blighty, the BBC’s decision to serialise Hilary Mantel’s story about a plot to kill Margaret Thatcher has been condemned in some quarters – and the prime minister concerned was already in her grave. It is not hard to imagine how an equivalent storyline would go down among the leaders of a country as paranoid as North Korea. Nor was Sony’s response to the hacking of its computers and the fears of big American cinema chains as inexplicable as they might seem from the UK. The attacks of 9/11 still cast their shadow; today’s US is more risk-averse than it was, and so-called asymmetric perils carry a special terror. The commercial aspect – the billions that might have to be paid out to victims if a threat had been ignored – also belongs in the equation. More remarkable, frankly, was President Obama’s démarche when he shamed Sony into moderating its retreat. As for the hacking itself, it seemed to stretch credulity that North Korea, given the state of its domestic communications, had the technical capacity to spy on Sony’s computers. Then again, Pyongyang has a longstanding – if not entirely successful – nuclear weapons programme, so a cyber-warfare contingency may not be far behind. Anyway, where North Korea is concerned, improbable should not be assumed to mean untrue. Facebook Twitter Pinterest ‘Dennis Rodman (pictured right with Kim Jong-un) does seem to have provided some line of communication.’ Photograph: KCNA/AFP/Getty Images On the contrary, the country has recent form. Remember Dennis Rodman, a basketball star who has paid six visits to North Korea in two years, the first organised by Vice TV. There is no suggestion that Rodman has provided any diplomatic back-channel between the two countries. Yet he does seem to have provided some line of communication. After an early visit, he vouchsafed that North Korea’s supreme leader, Kim Jong-un, had asked him to ask Obama to call him. More recently, he claimed to have helped obtain the release of an imprisoned Korean American. In the absence of normal relations, this is how things are done. It is not known whether Obama acted on Kim’s plea to pick up the phone. But the proposition came at a time when North-South Korean tension was particularly high, and the atmosphere seemed to calm gradually thereafter. Maybe someone, if not actually the president, made that call. So now with The Interview, all may not be as it seems. Pyongyang’s response, prickly as it was, at least suggests a degree of engagement with the outside world, and also a readiness to show its technological hand. The cat-and-mouse game with the internet since – hackings and blockings denied by both Washington and Pyongyang – could almost be seen as a primitive form of communication, and better that than no communication at all. As if to confirm that something might be afoot, South Korea today proposed formal talks next month “to prepare for peaceful reunification”. The most that is likely to result, if talks take place at all, is some family reunions and a return to the detente of a year ago. But this would not be nothing. The Interview has given Kim a reason to show he is still very much alive, and, to put an optimistic gloss on an awkward diplomatic standoff, may even have helped to clear the air.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Turkey’s Erdoğan to chair first cabinet meeting as president", "content": "Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has announced he will chair a cabinet meeting in January, a move unprecedented for a Turkish president in recent times. Previous presidents, including Erdoğan’s predecessor and one-time comrade Abdullah Gül, performed a largely ceremonial role but the office has been transformed in the four months since Erdoğan took charge. Chairing the cabinet meeting is an important step in his clear drive to enshrine the presidency as Turkey’s number one job, both in theory and in practice. Erdoğan led the Turkish government as prime minister from 2003 to 2014 and in August won the country’s first direct presidential elections. He told reporters on Monday that he would host the cabinet on 19 January at his vast new presidential palace in the Bestepe district of Ankara. “I will gather the cabinet ministers on 19 January at Bestepe and will chair the cabinet meeting there,” he said in televised comments, emphasising that this was allowed by the constitution. It will be the first time Erdoğan has chaired the cabinet since being elected president. Gül did not chair cabinet meetings when in office. The ruling Justice and Development party (AKP), co-founded by Erdoğan, is aiming for a large majority in parliamentary elections in June so that it can change the constitution and formalise the president’s powers. Erdoğan promised to be an active president during the election campaign in the summer, saying this was justified by the fact that he was being chosen by the people. He has since been true to his word, clearly leading Turkish policy on every issue from the Syria conflict to the economy. His opponents fear that Turkey is lurching to one-man rule under Erdoğan, who could theoretically stay in power until 2024. The presidential palace, which according to Erdoğan has 1,150 rooms, was built at a cost of about £385m and has become a symbol of official excess for his opponents.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"2015 will be a year of political thrills – and colossal dangers", "content": "A year of pivotal political significance beckons, up there with 1945 or 1979 – or more so. The election on 7 May risks setting an irreversible seal on a British future with a shrunken view of itself, its place in the world and the capacity or helplessness of its state to do anything much. Even its geographical size is at stake. There is no crystal ball, no pollster or bookie reckless enough to call the result of this most unpredictable election. Even money is the best you’ll get on Ed Miliband or David Cameron to be next prime minister. Labour stays ahead, but who creeps over the line first depends on too many variables – who votes where for the SNP, Ukip, Plaid or Green, how many votes will be wasted or not cast, leaving the country’s future in the hands of some 200,000 or so waverers in key marginals. Our broken first-past-the-post electoral system can’t reflect fairly these divergent views, forcing voters to obey the tactical diktats of the obsolescent two-party game, trying to play multi-dimensional chess on a flat board. A great many voters will be rightly angry on 8 May, either because they wasted their vote on minor parties clocking up plentiful support but few seats, or because they felt obliged to obey the iron rule – wear a nose peg and chose the least worst of two parties from which they feel increasingly alienated. They may at last rise up against this unjust voting system and demand proportional representation next time, no longer seeing it as an arcane Westminster village issue but as the only hope of new parties breaking through. But by then it may be too late. A government lacking the consent of more than a third may have caused irreversible damage. For political junkies, 2015 will be a year of thrills and enthralling possible permutations. Coalition-building could take as long as Belgium’s 535 days – and maybe a second election? In the turmoil, Cameron could be ousted by his jousting competitors – Boris Johnson with his preposterous Churchillian presumptions or chilly Theresa May, now wooing her party by exiling valuable successful foreign graduates, eagerly grabbed by our saner competitors. Don’t dismiss a second chance for David Davis, with his great anti-Etonian backstory. No one knows if the scrutiny of an election will strip away Nigel Farage’s Teflon coating: gripping a pint while ditching one embarrassing policy and candidate after another may wear thin. Or maybe not. What a bitter irony if Scotland’s detestation of Tories leads to so many seats for the SNP that Cameron crosses the line first. Might the Greens surge in just enough marginals to tip Labour’s chances? Wipeout for the Liberal Democrats looks likely when even Danny Alexander and David Laws, arch-austerian co-architects of George Osborne’s cuts, jump ship in fear of the electoral firing squad. For Westminster watchers, what larks! For those at the sharp end – the low-paid, the food bank users, bedroom tax debtors and all who struggle with rising rents and unpayable bills on fallen incomes – life will become more or less bearable according to the swing of the electoral pendulum. For middling earners fretting over inescapable commuter rail fare rises, outraged by the energy companies’ cartel, anxious over their children’s chance of finding a decent footing in work or housing, what happens at Westminster matters more than ever. Those feeling alienated need to know that not voting is no protest: it’s a vote gifted to those you most detest. For the country, another five years of Conservatives alone or in coalition, inflected by Ukip influence, would leave us barely recognisable to ourselves by 2020. A weak government would likely lead us out of the EU in 2017 – no new terms will ever assuage the Brexit fever sweeping through the Tory party. Cameron, or whatever leader, might not advocate staying in; even if they did, they might not win. The history of referendums – and why they are bad democracy – is that people use them to vote against the government of the day, regardless of the issue. Cameron and Osborne (or whoever), imposing a more extreme austerity than anything seen yet, will be at the height of their unpopularity. The idea the CBI can swing the pro-European cause seems far-fetched, with business panjandrums morally discredited by walloping pay and bonuses while everyone else took a hard hit and no banker paid any price. Scotland would depart, despite the oil price collapse exposing its economic vulnerability: who could blame it for preferring to be in Europe than in the miserable retreating UK? At the election, Jim Murphy’s difficult task for Labour is to persuade enough Scots not to vote SNP for Westminster now, risking bringing all this about. There will be time enough for breaking away, if that’s what they want – but first, please keep the Tories out of power in 2015. I hear SNP people swearing a coalition with Labour is the answer, but it won’t happen if Cameron wins even one more seat. Here’s another irony: if Labour limps over the line, first there will be a glorious day of rejoicing as removal vans sweep away the residents of No 10 and No 11, but what lies ahead may not be a joyous government. How fast people will forget the dangers averted. They will take for granted that the NHS is saved, with more money and a repeal of its competition clause, or that the BBC is not dismantled when its charter is renewed in 2016, or that the UK stays in the EU. They will forget that another £30-40bn was due to be cut, reducing government to 1930s proportions. If cuts are still made, they won’t remember the hundreds of thousands of public sector jobs saved or the million fewer children tipped into poverty, while the repealed bedroom tax will rapidly fade from memory. “What-ifs” are not cashable once an election is over. “What is” rules – and it will still be tough going. There will be considerably more money than under Osborne, but less than Labour voters may want. Keeping expectations low while inspiring enthusiasm to get the vote out is the tricky balancing act of the next 127 days to the election. Some sneer that Ed Balls offers no more than “austerity lite”, so what’s the difference? Let the Institute for Fiscal Studies be the judge: its director says the difference in the parties’ tax and spending plans is greater than he can remember. The 2015 election will be of colossal significance, but if Labour wins, Cameron’s dangerous alternative will be forgotten.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Southern rail strike talks adjourned", "content": "Talks at Acas aimed at bringing an end to the long-running Southern rail dispute have adjourned for the day, leaving passengers facing the uncertain prospect of further chaos on Britain’s biggest rail franchise. Southern’s owner, Govia Thameslink Railway, began talks with the drivers’ union, Aslef, on Wednesday morning, on the second day of a strike that had completely wiped out Southern’s services. Sources close to the talks described them as positive but with no concrete progress, and no concessions offered by either sides in terms of calling off the strike or halting the driver-only operation of trains. Talks will resume at 10.30am on Thursday and are likely to last through the week. All of Southern’s 2,242 weekday services, which normally carry more than 300,000 passengers, were cancelled again on Wednesday, the worst strike-led disruption since privatisation. If no resolution is found, an ongoing overtime ban will seriously disrupt services on Thursday, before drivers strike again on Friday. Conductors in the RMT union will walk out for two days from Monday. While talks will resume between GTR and Aslef on Thursday, relations between the train operator and the RMT union, representing conductors, have been further damaged after the RMT leader, Mick Cash, left Acas claiming to have been “barred” from talks. Cash said GTR was fully aware on Tuesday night that he would be attending talks, but that he was told on arrival by the company that he would not be allowed to take part. “RMT is furious at the complete contempt that has been shown to us by Southern rail this morning, which leaves us in a state of limbo when we should all be around the table thrashing out the issues that have led to the current action. “Our members were expecting discussions to take place today and instead we have had the door slammed in our faces. That is no way to rebuild the confidence of the workforce in the Southern management and the talks process and it is no way to reach a solution, which is what the public are crying out for.” But GTR said it still hoped to talk to Cash, although only Aslef had been invited by Acas to discuss the current strike by drivers. Nick Brown, GTR’s chief operating officer, said: “We hope today’s talks with the Aslef leadership are productive. I have spoken with the general secretary of the RMT this morning and informed him we’d be happy to meet him at Acas later today to talk about any new proposals he has to try and end the conductors’ dispute and I also asked him to call off their programme of strikes planned for Christmas and New Year.” Little progress is believed to have been made on Wednesday in talks between GTR and Aslef, but the fact that neither side has yet left the negotiating table may be a positive sign. Previous talks had broken down swiftly as the company continued to insist on the flexibility to run trains without a second crew member in some circumstances – a red line for the unions who fear jobs will be lost or deskilled, as the company, and more broadly the government, pushes to introduce more driver-only-operated trains. The current talks take place after days of recriminations from both sides, with the train drivers’ union Aslef accusing the government of blocking serious talks and manipulating the Southern dispute. The transport secretary, Chris Grayling, said the unions had embarked on an unnecessary political strike. Passengers on Southern and Gatwick Express have been warned to expect services to be severely disrupted on Thursday following the strike and an ongoing overtime ban. Southern passenger services director, Angie Doll, said: “We will be working hard to run as many services as possible tomorrow, but regrettably I have to warn passengers that services will be severely impacted, with reductions and cancellations across all routes. “With today’s strike ending at midnight, despite our best efforts, some trains and crew will still not be in position for tomorrow’s service; and the overtime ban will continue to have a serious impact.” Southern advised passengers not to travel at all on Friday, when drivers will again be on strike. There will be no Southern services and Gatwick Express will run every half an hour. A commuter group is planning a protest march from Southern’s major London hub, Victoria, to the Department for Transport on Thursday. The Department for Transport is playing down the idea of toughening strikes laws but not ruling it out as a last resort. Chris Philp, the Tory MP for Croydon South, said he will continue to push for a rule that when a strike occurs on critical public infrastructure, at least a 50% service is maintained and the strike should be “reasonable and proportionate,” after meeting with Chris Grayling, the transport secretary, this week. “When you have a system of driver-only operated trains operating on the network and the track today where a strike is taking place, it’s clearly not safety concerns that are behind this,” Philp said. “When they are bringing such misery on commuters, when there are not safety concerns and no job losses, it’s an issue for them to address.” At least seven Conservative MPs whose constituencies are affected by the Southern strike are understood to be backing Philp’s plan. Paul Scully, Conservative MP for Sutton and Cheam, told the Guardian he was one of them, saying more trade union legislation should be considered after the strike is over. “If you are having a dispute about automation, then the last thing you should do is show how the human factor of driving trains and acting as guards can be so disruptive. We’ve got to get the dispute out the way and make sure we have talks but after that we have to look at making sure this can’t happen again.” Theresa May was pressed on the issue in prime minister’s questions, branding it an “appalling strike” and criticising Labour’s links to Aslef. The issue had been raised by Tim Loughton, MP for Shoreham, who said one of his constituents will struggle to get to University College Hospital London for life-saving cancer drug trials.",diasaster:0},

The terrorist outrage last week in central Istanbul, which left 38 dead and 166 wounded, was the 31st terror attack in the last year and a half. And it was the 31st time the country had followed exactly the same routine: shock, followed by a ban on news that was augmented by calls for national unity from official spokesmen, and then a statement from the president paving the way for social media trolls to target anyone who questions the government. Turkey vows vengeance after bombing kills 38 and wounds 166 Read more Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s administration is not inclined to be deflected by crisis. Immediately after the attack, Burhan Kuzu, a law professor and senior adviser to the president, went on social media to celebrate constitutional proposals that would expand the president’s powers, and maybe see Erdoğan in power until 2029 – “so no system change can happen without blood”. After the 28 June attack on Atatürk airport, the diversionary tactic was to mask the national shock with celebrations of a newly built bridge. The scene of the latest terrorist attack has been quickly woven into the narrative. Henceforth it will be known as the Hill of Martyrs. It pays to acquiesce; indeed it has become essential. This week a young boy grieving at the funeral of his father, killed in the latest attack, was seen to look at President Erdoğan in a not-so-admiring way. Government supporters are now calling for an investigation into the entire family. We gave up asking the astonished question ‘How can they say or do that?' some time ago This refashioning of a post-truth, post-fact Turkey has not happened overnight. The process has involved the skilful and wilful manipulation of narratives. We gave up asking the astonished questions “How can they say or do that?” some time ago. Truth is a lost game in my country. In Europe and America, you still have time to rescue it – but you must learn from Turkey how easily it can be lost. It started 15 years ago, with a phenomenon that will now be familiar to you, when intellectuals and journalists reacted to a nascent populism with the self-critical question: “Are we out of touch?” To counter that possibility, they widened the parameters of public debate to include those who were said to be representatives of “real people”. We thought our own tool, the ability to question and establish truth, would be adequate to keep the discourse safe. It wasn’t. Soon we were paralysed by the lies of populism, which always sounded more attractive than our boring facts. We found, as you are now finding, that the new truth-building process does not require facts or the underpinning of agreed values. We were confronted – as you are being confronted – by a toxic vocabulary: “elite”, “experts”, “real people” and “alienated intellectuals”. The elite, with experts as mouthpieces of that oppressive elite, were portrayed as people detached from society, willing to suppress the needs, choices and beliefs of “real people”. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Twin bomb blasts in Istanbul kill 38, injure 166 Events moved quickly. Those who believed experts should be excluded from the truth-building process, and that the facts were too boring to be bothered with, became the most active participants in a reconstruction of their own truth. The magic word was “respect”, with the demand that the elite, since they were so out of touch, should respect real people’s truth. There is an irony to be noted here, as it says much about Erdoğan’s Turkey. One of the first to advocate Karl Popper’s idea of letting the common people construct the truth was the commentator Şahin Alpay. He is now 74, seriously ill and in prison – because this mobilised and organised ignorance has no time for any kind of intellect, even that which helped it capture the political stage in the first place. What is the practical effect of this new truth on everyday life? Well, consider one example. In Turkey today, we are obliged to indulge a debate about whether minors should be married to their rapists. It is predicated on the “real people’s” truth that in rural areas girls get married even when they are just 13, and thus have sexual maturity. It is, we are told, a thoroughly elitist argument to insist that a minor cannot give consent.

Erdoğan’s government has detained more than 100 journalists and closed down at least 100 news outlets. Photograph: Emrah Gurel/AP We have learned a lesson, but too late. The question “Are we out of touch?” leads to “them and us”, which then morphs into “either us or them”. As we found in Turkey, the masses choose “them”. From that point you find yourself, like me, labelled “not real people” in your own country. Europe and the US will soon learn that being “elite” is not about social class or education: it is about obedience to one version of the truth. Prepare for your own version of this. The other week, in Copenhagen, I attended NewsXhange, an international gathering of the media to discuss redefining journalism when trust is at an all-time low. The opening symposium was titled “Are we out of touch?”. There to prove that indeed we were was a jubilant figure well known to you in Britain – the former Ukip leader Nigel Farage. You have no idea about real people, he said, before offering us some gracious lessons on how he saw real journalism. One by one, panellists and members of the audience sought to corner him with references to fact-checking and double fact-checking, to holding politicians to account and doing better journalism. They tried to embarrass him by calling him a xenophobe. The corrosive effect of jailing novelists and journalists in Turkey Read more And as he spoke, I looked at the expressions on the faces in the audience, and recognised them. They were our faces from 15 years ago, amazed at his audacity, wondering: how can he say that? – unsure whether to mock his twisted logic or to take it seriously. An analogy came to mind: that this is like trying to play chess with a pigeon. Even if you win within the rules, the pigeon will clutter up the pieces, and finally it will shit on the chessboard, leaving you to deal with the mess. Farage, having told us to “cheer up”, and that this was “not a funeral”, did exactly that. Having dumbfounded the audience, he announced – as if fleeing a boring party – that he was off to meet Donald Trump in Washington. Be warned. For 15 years we played chess with the pigeon in Turkey, but now we don’t even have the chessboard. Some of you still have time to shape your future. Use it.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Russell Oberlin obituary", "content": "Two countertenors, one British, one American, were at the centre of the early music movement as it gathered momentum in the middle of the 20th century: Alfred Deller and Russell Oberlin. While Deller was firmly rooted in the Anglican choral tradition, the voice and stylistic address of the Ohio-born Oberlin, who has died at the age of 88, were conspicuously more secular – early professional assignments included the advertising of a brand of toilet paper. Eschewing falsetto, Oberlin’s tone, seamless through a range of over two octaves, had a more incisive quality than Deller’s pure sound, though he arguably lacked the expressive mastery of the greatest of the legions of countertenors that followed him on both sides of the Atlantic. To his admirers, such as Joel Cohen, former director of the Boston Camerata, his androgynous voice wafted “as though an angel were singing from on high, in some celestial tongue unknown to man”. In the high range the tone could indeed be ethereal; in the lower register it was darker and more complex, slightly threatening, and the tone could harden unattractively under pressure. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Russell Oberlin singing Purcell’s Music for a While Oberlin was a leading light in Noah Greenberg’s New York Pro Musica Antiqua, founded in 1952 to resurrect, in a scholarly fashion, the repertoire of the middle ages, Renaissance and early baroque periods. The success of its landmark 1958 production of the medieval liturgical drama The Play of Daniel, which opened at the Cloisters of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, was due in no small part to Oberlin. For him Greenberg created the role of Belshazzar’s Prince, the son of the biblical Babylonian king who asks his Jewish adviser, Daniel, to interpret the words he sees a hand writing on a wall. The tacit rivalry between Oberlin and Deller continued when Covent Garden invited Oberlin to play Oberon in Britten’s A Midsummer Night’s Dream in its new production of 1961 – he also took the role in the North American premiere in Vancouver and in the US premiere in San Francisco the same year. The part had been written for Deller and first performed by him in Aldeburgh the previous summer: he was deeply offended by the slight. Rumour had it, however, that in overstretching his instrument in the role, Oberlin shortened his career. Certainly it came to a premature end when he retired from the platform, after a period of ill-health, in 1966 at the age of 38. He turned to teaching, appearing as lecturer and lecture-recitalist at colleges and universities throughout the US and abroad. In 1971 he was appointed professor of music at Hunter College at the City University of New York, and director of the Hunter College Vocal Collegium. A native of Akron, Ohio, the son of John, a tyre examiner for Firestone, and his wife, Ethel (nee Keys), Oberlin showed early promise as a treble in his local church choir and was soon performing throughout the state. His talents were exploited on the radio, where he provided vocals for jingles advertising such products as flour and Seminole toilet paper. At this time, too, he won the Major Bowes Amateur Hour, a nationwide radio talent competition, with his rendering of Until, a sentimental ballad by the English organist and composer Wilfrid Sanderson. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Russell Oberlin singing Vivi, Tiranno from Handel’s Rodelinda He received his vocal education at the Juilliard School of Music, New York, where his teachers included the baritone Evan Evans, graduating with a diploma in 1951. At this stage he was a tenor but, encouraged by Greenberg, he switched to countertenor. As he explained to a newspaper in 1961: “I simply found that the more I sang the higher parts the easier they became. I can sing falsetto, but I really can’t go much higher that way than I can otherwise, and the quality is not the same.” With Pro Musica he performed at home and abroad on the group’s tours, which included appearances at various European cathedrals (1960), summer festivals (1963) and in the USSR (1964). He also sang as a countertenor with opera companies, orchestras and ensembles and in theatrical productions. On Broadway he performed incidental music by Leonard Bernstein for Jean Anouilh’s drama The Lark (1955) and by Lee Hoiby for John Webster’s tragedy The Duchess of Malfi (1957). His first recordings were a series of 10 discs of mostly medieval music (1957-60) for the company known as Expériences Anonymes, which later became the Lyrichord label. For Lyrichord he also made the first LP devoted to the 13th-century Cantigas de Santa Maria (1994). Further recordings featured the music of Purcell, Bach (including ones made with Leonard Bernstein and Glenn Gould), Handel and Schumann. These recordings, as well as his short-lived stage career, helped to establish the countertenor voice as a suitable vehicle for music of the early period. But he also provided, with the highly individual calibre of his instrument, an alternative to the Anglican “hoot”, which some found precious, and to the falsetto vocal production ubiquitous in Britain and elsewhere. Allegiance to one or the other voice type remains a matter of taste, but it was a differentiation that was to lead to a far greater variety of timbre among countertenor voices in the decades to come. He is survived by his sister, Jean. • Russell Keys Oberlin, countertenor, born 11 October 1928; died 25 November 2016",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Corbyn says polling party members to shape policy is here to stay", "content": "The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, said polling the party’s members to help shape policy is here to stay as he marked his first 100 days in office. Corbyn said consulting members would continue after he used the method to show support for his stance on Syria, adding: “Politics better get used to the idea”. He also criticised MPs who applauded the speech of Hilary Benn, the shadow foreign secretary, on the Syria airstrikes, saying it was inappropriate. “I did not agree with it. I was appalled that MPs should clap, shout and cheer when we were deciding to go and bomb somewhere. Parliament is supposed to be serious. It’s not a place for jingoistic cheering,” he said. Amid a persistent gulf between some Labour MPs and their leadership, Corbyn made clear he is planning more polls of the membership in an interview with the Huffington Post. He acknowledged there were some administrative problems with analysing the responses of members on the Syria vote – which showed 75% supported his position – but defended the idea of consulting members. Labour MPs, such as John Woodcock, the pro-airstrike former chair of the New Labour pressure group Progress, criticised the method and timing of the survey as “not credible”, arguing it excluded some members, especially those not active on social media. But Corbyn said: “I hope that had an influence on what Labour MPs were thinking, I hope that had an influence on public opinion. I don’t apologise for that, I think it’s the right thing to do. And it’s something I will do again.” He said polling could be used to help form policy on Trident if a way could be found of analysing nuanced replies and managing the volume of responses. But Angela Eagle, the shadow business secretary, who is leader of the party’s national policy form, sounded cool on Sunday about suggestions that the influence of members was being increased. She said Labour needed to allow members into the policy-forming process but that members of the wider public should also be involved. She told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show: “We don’t make policy by plebiscite because there are very few policies that have clear, black and white, yes or no answers in a complex world. What we need to have is debate and decision-making after everybody has been listened to, democratically arrived at through the policy processes.” Eagle also said she disagreed with Corbyn about the MPs who applauded Benn’s speech in favour of airstrikes. Eagle, who voted on the same side as Benn, said: “I think it was genuine admiration for the case that had been made by Hilary Benn, which I have to say was far better than the case the prime minister managed to make.” Asked whether Corbyn would lead the party in 2020, she said Labour would “work with the leader we have got”. After 100 days in the job, Corbyn is making clear that he intends to lead the party into the 2020 election and stressing his huge mandate with the party membership. There has been speculation that the Labour leader will shake up his top team in January after five months of leadership. Corbyn has had differences of opinion with some in his shadow cabinet not just over the Syria vote but also policy on Trident, which is being reviewed by Maria Eagle, the shadow defence secretary, and Ken Livingstone, the former mayor of London. Over the weekend, Corbyn said his critics within the party should share their talents and not obsess about his leadership. Asked about the possibility of a reshuffle in January, he said: “There will be appointments when appointments are made.” But in his Huffington Post interview, he played down the prospect that the boundary review taking place in 2018 would be used to get rid of Labour MPs who do not agree with the leadership. He said he was not making any proposals for reselection of MPs but it would be up to party members if they wanted to do that. Asked what would happen if members wanted to change the reselection rules, to use the boundary review to open up the whole process for every MP, he said: “It’s not up to me, it’s up to the party to decide … I am not a dictator”. Saying he would like MPs to engage more with party members and constituents, Corbyn added: “I think we should all be accountable to our parties but I also think that accountability should be a process of engagement: that MPs do engage with their constituency parties, do engage with their constituents, and MPs do change their minds on things because of local opinion. That’s not wrong. “There’s nothing bad about that and many MPs clearly changed their mind on the Syria vote between what I was picking up when the proposal first came and what happened five days later.” Len McCluskey, the general secretary of the Unite union, which is Labour’s biggest financial backer, said on Sunday that some in the parliamentary party needed to change their attitude, and criticised the small number who have been “enormously disrespectful” towards their leader. He said that at the same time Corbyn was “learning to be a leader” and everyone was on a learning curve about the changes in the party.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Stories of 2015: born on a rescue boat – a baby refugee's progress", "content": "Traditionally, the hilltop Sicilian city of Ragusa is a place where, in summer, tourists wind their way around Unesco-listed streets and, in winter, elderly men dressed in suits and sunglasses despite the grey skies go for their regular morning stroll. But this year it has also become an unlikely home for women seeking sanctuary after the perilous sea journey to Europe. One of them, Stephanie, arrived in July with her baby girl. Just weeks before, on board an Italian navy ship in the Mediterranean, Francesca had been born. She shared her birth week with another little girl, Princess Charlotte of Cambridge. But there the comparisons ended. The Italian navy issued a photograph of Francesca’s face, peeking out from beneath white fabric. She was the sixth baby to have been born on a rescue ship since 2013. Rescued Mediterranean migrant gives birth to baby girl on Italian navy ship Read more Just months on and Francesca has grown into an inquisitive and wide-eyed baby, used to being showered with affection at the Ragusa women’s refuge. Along with her 25-year-old mother, there are two children and 13 women living at the centre, the majority from Nigeria. While Stephanie speaks highly of the refuge, part of a government network of homes for refugees and asylum seekers (Sprar), she has less fond memories of the nearly two months she spent at a Sicilian migration centre. “It was so horrible, I didn’t like it. It was so boring, so rough,” she says. A hair stylist from Benin City in southern Nigeria, Stephanie frequently drove with her employer to Libya for business, a journey of two and a half days. It was while selling hair products there that she met and married a Nigerian man, before finding domestic work in Tripoli. Stephanie decided to flee Libya as her pregnancy progressed and the security situation worsened in the increasingly violent and chaotic country. “After two months everything was torn upside down; what I wished for wasn’t there any more,” she said, explaining that she left her husband during the pregnancy because he was violent. A Nigerian woman described as a friend helped arrange her passage to Europe, without asking for payment. Stephanie’s home city is the departure point for the vast majority of Nigerian victims trafficked to Europe for prostitution, according to a March report by the European Refugee Fund. But she denies knowing about the trade. “I was in the boat and I did not even know I was going to Italy, because in my condition I was so weak,” she said. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Francesca, soon after her birth. Photograph: Marina Militare/EPA Antonio La Monica, the Ragusa centre director, spoke about working with the Italian police to tackle the issue. “Often they are trafficking victims, even if they don’t say so. It’s a very hard problem, because there’s a network [of traffickers] that comes to take them almost immediately,” he said. The young women are often promised jobs in Italy and forced into sex work, told they will be freed once they have paid a debt that can be as high as €80,000 (£57,700). So far this year about 5,000 Nigerian women have arrived in Italy by sea, the largest female group by nationality and a significant increase on the 1,454 who took the same route in 2014. In Ragusa, Stephanie passes her time looking after baby Francesca while she waits for her asylum claim to be assessed. The process hit a hurdle when La Monica realised the duo were “formally ghosts”. The naval commander logged the birth but the message never made it from the portside to the local authorities, meaning they lacked essential paperwork. “In the end the situation was so paradoxical we resorted to the ‘Italian way’ and called Rai,” said La Monica, referring to the state news channel. The bureaucratic hold-up ended a day later and now Stephanie is hoping to be granted refugee status. “I want my papers, then I’ll start looking for a job,” she said, willing to go anywhere in Italy there is employment. Turning to her baby, Stephanie said she would also try to nurture any artistic talents she saw in Francesca. “I will take care of her as a mother, for education and everything,” she said. In the quiet surroundings of Ragusa there is little opportunity for Francesca to meet playmates, but Stephanie hopes one day the two of them will be given the opportunity to meet the Duchess of Cambridge and Princess Charlotte, the baby with such a different start in life. “For the mother to see me and talk face to face I think would be very good,” she said. “But how is it going to be possible?”",diasaster:0},

The rape and murder of 23-year-old student Jyoti Singh on a bus in Delhi in 2012 caused global outrage and triggered reform of legislation relating to sexual offences. Her family allowed her to be named in an attempt to end the stigma facing sex attack victims in India. The freed man, who was 17 at the time of the crime and cannot be named, was sentenced to three years in a reform facility in August 2013 and finished his term this weekend. Under Indian law, regardless of the crime, under-18s can be imprisoned for a maximum of three years. On Friday Delhi’s high court rejected a petition to extend the sentence, saying that the man had served the maximum under the law. Several activists and politicians demanded that he not be released until it could be proven that he had reformed. The supreme court rejected an appeal against his release on Monday. Days after the third anniversary of the attack, Indian police confirmed that the rapist, now 20, had completed his spell behind bars. He is now being supervised by a non-governmental agency, which will help him to receive training to become a tailor. “The convict was handed over to an NGO. He is no longer under the jurisdiction of the police,” a police spokesman told AFP. A source added: “He has been given a new identity and his criminal record has been expunged.” The prospect of the rapist walking free has revived public anger over the attack. On Sunday protests led by Singh’s parents took place near the India Gate monument in the centre of the capital. “I am forced to protest on the road as this government appears blind to the atrocities being committed against women in India,” said Singh’s mother, Asha, who was dragged away along with other protesters by police. “When will the government wake up? What kind of murder or crime against a woman will make the government see reason? This government wants women to suffer and die. Society will decide what to do with this government … I just want justice, I want a stay on his release.” she said, according to local media translation.

Singh’s father said: “Not only in India but also abroad, people do not want his release, as he had not done the act of a juvenile. The prime minister has the power to stop his release, but no one is taking any action.” Singh said his family had been failed by India’s legal system. “What can I say? There are no words to describe our disappointment,” he said, referring to the Supreme Court’s decision to reject the appeal against the rapist’s release. “We don’t understand all these laws. We only know that the system has failed us.” Four other men were sentenced to death in the case, and a fifth, the alleged ringleader, died in custody in 2013. The four adults who went to trial confessed to the attack but later retracted their confessions, saying they had been tortured into admitting their involvement.

Sacha Dench plans to use a paramotor – a kind of parachute propelled by a motor – to brave temperatures of -9C (15.8F) as she mirrors the Bewick’s swan’s yearly migration route. The swans migrate as the northern Russian winter turns inhospitable and birds travel west to Britain and other milder climes. We should strengthen, not strangle, European protections for our wildlife | Martin Spray Read more There are an estimated 16,000 of the species left in the world, and their number has halved in the last two decades. Wildlife experts do not know exactly why the population is falling so dramatically – other swan species have not suffered similar declines – but shooting by hunters, habitat loss and climate change are all believed to be factors. In late 2016, Dench who works for the Wildfowl & Wetlands Trust (WWT) at Slimbridge in Gloucestershire, will take flight to find out why, and push governments along her epic route to adopt an action plan that so far only Estonia has agreed to. Her journey through some of the remotest parts of Europe, about 370 miles (600km), has no roads and will be undertaken in gruelling conditions. Facebook Twitter Pinterest The expedition will uncover new science about the Bewick’s swans, whose numbers have halved in the last 20 years. Photograph: Angharad Barlow/WWT “We have to get used to flying in the cold, it could be -9C. Taking off [with the paramotor] is one thing, it’s energetic, but once you’re flying you’re reasonably static, you’re just moving your arms,” said Dench. “If you get too cold, your decision-making gets sloppy. If your feet get too cold, you can’t land on them, because you need to land running.” Including her kit, fuel and the paramotor itself, Dench will have to be capable of running with 35-40kg of weight on her back. “I can carry that at the moment, but the thing is being able to run with it, to take off.” She will also have to cope with extremely early starts, sometimes waking at 3am to take off at dawn when winds – which will regularly be blowing against her – are relatively light. Each flight could last up to three hours, depending on the cold and the winds. Bewick’s swan 50th ‘swanniversary’ - in pictures Read more “The chances of being stopped by weather are really, really high,” Dench said, adding that her team – which will include an as-yet-unnamed pilot and a Russian national, Alexander Bogdanov – will have several backup plans in place. Bogdanov will help her communicate with remote communities when they land. Dench is learning Russian but said she doubts it will be perfect by the time she leaves. The expedition’s biggest achievement, she said, would be if countries along the way take up an action plan to stem the species’ decline. She will traverse 11 countries in 10 weeks, including Finland, Germany, Poland and the Netherlands. “We know that there are multiple impacts [causing the swan’s decline]. Shooting is a considerable one. About a quarter of Bewick’s have shot in them, when we x-ray them at Slimbridge,” she said. “But even at that high rate is doesn’t seem to be solely responsible for their decline.” Facebook Twitter Pinterest Flock of Bewick’s swans flying at Slimbridge. Photograph: James Lees/WWT A loss of wetlands, disturbance of habitats along the route and more predation by Arctic foxes are all considered further factors. The Bewick is smaller than the larger and more aggressive whooper swans that migrate west to Slimbridge each year and are known for having particularly close family relationships.

{ "title":"NHS staff were prepared for Ebola risks at the frontline in west Africa", "content": "A confirmed Ebola case among one of the first healthcare workers to leave the UK for Sierra Leone is a major blow to the public health authorities, who have been trying to quieten fears about any possible impact of the disease here while ramping up the fight in west Africa. Huge efforts were made to try to ensure that none of the hundreds of NHS workers who volunteered to make the trip would return with the virus. It took several months before the final decisions were made on which volunteers would be sent. They were given psychological tests and intensive training; the first batch were trained for nine days, much of it in a simulated treatment centre at the sort of high temperatures to be expected in Sierra Leone. Finally, just 30 were sent out in the first wave in the last weeks of November. They were as well prepared as anybody could be. The long delay in their deployment was to make sure nobody would bring Ebola back to the UK. All the healthcare workers who have gone out have been well trained in the dangers, but the work they have gone to do is physically and mentally very demanding. The virus is not as contagious as many people fear. It is fragile; it can be killed by soap and water, chlorine solutions and sunlight. But the doctors, nurses, paramedics and others who are working in Sierra Leone with Ebola patients will never have experienced such arduous working conditions before. The job is incredibly hard. Donning the protective suits takes time and every step must be cross-checked by a colleague. They then can enter the Ebola ward where they will give whatever care is available to the patients. In most treatment centres, that mostly means hydration and painkillers and encouraging people to eat and drink. Some centres are also getting staff to put in drips and lines into veins through which they can give drug infusions. It is very difficult work, carried out behind a mask that fogs up and while wearing two pairs of gloves. It is also exhausting. Most people cannot stay in for more than an hour. Each one has a colleague who stays with them and leaves at the same time. The precautions are great but there is still the capacity for human error, particularly in the heat and the tense and anxious conditions of an Ebola treatment centre. Removing the protective suits has to be done with extraordinary discipline. One item at a time comes off, with chlorine solution sprayed over the nurse or doctor at every stage. Everybody knows this part is dangerous. And yet, it may be the routine in the end that causes mistakes. In some centres there are day and night shifts, which means people may not be getting enough sleep. And everybody is frustrated by the limited amount they can do to treat their patients, while no proven drugs are available. It is not surprising that a healthcare worker from the UK has been infected. The unfortunate thing is that it has happened so soon. It would be a tragedy if this incident stopped more volunteers being sent or if it started another wave of Ebola panic in the UK. This virus would not easily be passed on in this country. The healthcare worker who has fallen ill must have been sufficiently well to pass the many temperature checks on the route home, first at Freetown airport, then in Casablanca, which has a full body heat scanner, and then at Heathrow, where Public Health England’s nurses take you through a questionnaire and yet another temperature check. Until this person had a fever, he or she was not infectious. The risk to the British public is very low. But public confidence may again take a knock.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Russian recession fears as economy shrinks for first time in five years", "content": "The Russian economy has contracted for the first time in five years after falling oil prices and sanctions imposed by western governments began to take their toll. The prospects for the country’s economy are expected to remain weak after President Vladimir Putin’s government revealed that GDP in November was 0.5% lower than in the same month a year ago. It is the first time since October 2009 that the Russian economy has shrunk and comes at a time when the rouble has been collapsing on foreign exchange markets after a near halving of the oil price since June. Manufacturing, construction, agriculture and service sectors all contracted in November, although energy, mining and the retail trade showed continued growth. Economists are warning that Russia – one of the world’s biggest energy exporters – could be facing its first recession in five years. The central bank fears the economy could shrink by up to 4.8% next year if oil prices fail to recover from five-year lows. The repercussions are starting to be felt. A week ago Russia’s central bank threw a £340m lifeline to Trust Bank – a Moscow bank that uses the Hollywood star Bruce Willis to advertise its credit cards – and the government has agreed to a 1tn-rouble recapitalisation of the nation’s banks. The guarantee on bank account deposits has also been raised to try to quell people’s concerns about the safety of their savings. The fail in the oil price comes at a time when western sanctions imposed over Russia’s backing for separatists in Ukraine are making it tough for the country’s banks to raise finance in the international money markets, leading to billions of dollars being withdrawn from the country. The GDP data was said to be the first signal that further contraction in the economy is likely. “This is the beginning of a recession,” Ruslan Grinberg, director of the Institute of Economics at the Russian Academy of Sciences, told the AFP news agency. Dmitry Polevoy, the chief economist for Russia and the Commonwealth of Independent States at ING Bank in Moscow, told Reuters that things would get worse with oil prices at their current levels. “There is no cause for optimism,” Polevoy said. “This is linked to sanctions first of all, oil and the panic we saw on the market in December. “The damage to the banking system and consumer sentiment will take a long time to repair.” Oil prices have fallen after the oil producing cartel Opec refused to cut production to shore up the price, which has slipped below $60 a barrel from its recent high of $115. Oil and gas account for 70% of Russia’s exports and Moscow needs an oil price in the region of $100 a barrel to balance its budget. This dependency on oil has led to a rout of the rouble on the foreign exchange markets, prompting an emergency rise in interest rates to 17% from 12.5% earlier this month. As a result, the currency has recouped some of the ground lost against the dollar - where it was trading at historic lows earlier this month – although it slipped back yesterday after the data was released. Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, has said that the failing oil price should help fuel economic growth – the price of petrol has been falling at pumps and inflation in the UK is running at its lowest level for 12 years.

{ "title":"David Ryall obituary", "content": "David Ryall, who has died aged 79, was one of the most distinguished character actors at the National Theatre over many years, playing important roles for successive artistic directors, Laurence Olivier and Peter Hall, in the 1970s and 80s, and appearing in the premieres of plays by Tom Stoppard, Michael Frayn, Peter Shaffer, Adrian Mitchell, Peter Nichols and Simon Gray. And as do many character actors today, he wore the Harry Potter label, appearing in the seventh of the eight films, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part One (2010), as Dumbledore’s friend Elphias Doge, who greets Harry at the wedding of Bill Weasley and Fleur Delacour before he “disapparates” in the mayhem caused by the Death Eaters. But even in this cameo, you can see the twinkling charm of the actor, and gauge the lightness and musicality of his voice, which emanated from a benign, rubbery visage that could all the same cloud and harden with darker emotions. He was familiar in patrician, or grandfatherly, roles in the most adventurous series on television in the last few decades: suffering from dementia as Claire Skinner’s father, Frank, in the semi-improvised family comedy series Outnumbered; as patriotic Eric in Goodnight Sweetheart starring a time-travelling Nicholas Lyndhurst; or as old Bert, who recounts his life in a series of flashbacks, in The Village, starring John Simm and Maxine Peake. He last appeared at the National in 2011, when he played a wry, decrepit Feste in Peter Hall’s 80th birthday present production of Twelfth Night, with Hall’s daughter, Rebecca, as Viola. The theory was that this Feste might have been a defrocked priest in a former life; he certainly came with a lot of buried baggage, and made it tell.

Photograph: Hat Trick/BBC And having once played Gloucester, beautifully, to the King Lear of Oliver Ford Davies at the Almeida theatre in 2002, he signed off as Lear himself in a low-key fringe production at the Cockpit theatre, London, in March 2014. This was a remarkable performance. Recovering from a course of chemotherapy, Ryall played the monarch with a script in hand, and with his daughters in the cast, as his carers, almost: Imogen was the doctor, and Charlie, the younger sibling, was a touching Cordelia. As Lear, he entered in a wheelchair. At the end, he put Cordelia in the same chair and died with his head in her lap, letting the script, at last, fall to the floor, all passion spent. At the time of this performance, he described in the Guardian the effect Olivier had had on him in their years of working together: “When he left the room, it was as if all the furniture went with him. Nothing was left behind.” The only child of John, a clerical worker with P&O, and Gladys, he was born in Shoreham-by-Sea, West Sussex, and went to Shoreham grammar school. David joined the merchant navy for a brief while but his father, noting his enthusiasm for amateur dramatics, encouraged him to try for drama school. He won a scholarship to Rada in 1962, appeared in repertory theatre in Salisbury, joined the National in 1965 on a year’s contract and stayed for eight. He appeared in Stoppard’s Jumpers and Shaffer’s The Royal Hunt of the Sun, Nichols’s The National Health and Carl Zuckmayer’s The Captain of Köpenick, in which Paul Scofield gave one of his greatest performances. In 1973, he joined Peter O’Toole for a season at the Bristol Old Vic, appearing in Shaw’s The Apple Cart and Ben Travers’s Plunder, while becoming increasingly busy on television in such series as The Pallisers in 1974 (he played Sexton Parker) and, later on, Lovejoy, Casualty, The Bill, Doctors, The Singing Detective, Prime Suspect, Inspector Morse and Holby City. Back at the National, and now on the South Bank, he featured in Richard Eyre’s glorious revival of Guys and Dolls in 1982, as well as Eyre’s production, in the same year, of The Beggar’s Opera with Imelda Staunton and Paul Jones, followed by a string of performances for Hall: as Sicinius Velutus in Ian McKellen’s magnificent Coriolanus in 1984, and in a masked, semi-anthropomorphic Animal Farm. He won the Clarence Derwent award for a supporting actor in 1985. He played Winston Churchill three times in separate television projects, a jowly, rhetorical flourish easily encompassed. Everything he did, in fact, looked easy and unforced, and at the same time naturally funny. When he switched horses from the National to the Royal Shakespeare Company, briefly, at the end of the 90s, he was an ideal Polonius in a strangely underrated Hamlet with Alex Jennings. He then embroiled himself in John Barton’s long simmering, never satisfactory Tantalus epic, directed by Hall, before returning to the National to play Herbert Wehner in Frayn’s Democracy ( in 2003, with Roger Allam as Willy Brandt), directed by Michael Blakemore. Film roles included the Man with Whores in David Lynch’s The Elephant Man (1980), with Anthony Hopkins and John Hurt, George in Anthony Minghella’s Truly Madly Deeply (1990), the Mayor in Christopher Hampton’s Carrington (1995) and Lord Salisbury in Frank Coraci’s Around the World in Eighty Days (2004). His last film was Dustin Hoffman’s Quartet (2012), scripted by Ronald Harwood, in which he played a lovely Flanagan and Allen duet of Underneath the Arches with Trevor Peacock in a retirement home for old musicians. He is survived by his third wife, Penny (nee England); by a son, Jonathan, a music manager, and daughter, Imogen, a jazz singer, from his first marriage, to Gillian Eddison, which ended in divorce; and by a daughter, Charlie, an actor, from his second marriage, to Cathy Buchwald, which ended in divorce. • David Ryall, actor, born 5 January 1935; died 25 December 2014",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"National Archives: revelations from the released documents", "content": "GCSEs Margaret Thatcher believed the introduction of GCSEs would lead to a “can’t fail mentality” and a lowering of standards in schools, the files show. They reveal she voiced strong doubts to her education secretary, Sir Keith Joseph, when he proposed their introducton to replace O-levels and CSEs. A note for her advisers before a meeting with Joseph reads: “You are concerned that the new approach will lead to lower standards [and] a shift away from the traditional approach to learning in favour of a ‘can’t fail mentality’.” Joseph however managed to assuage her fears, telling her the new exams would inject “more rigour” into the system, and suggested she was in danger of “misleading herself”: “I am quite certain that the new examination is more and potentially very much more stretching than the O-levels and CSEs it replaces,” he wrote. The files also show that a young Oliver Letwin, working in Thatcher’s Downing Street policy unit, advised the prime minister in April 1986 that “education is still, fundamentally, a nationalised industry”. As a first step he proposed a dozen grant-aided primary schools which would be independent but directly funded by the government. Miners’ strike The possible public exposure of MI5’s spying activities in the final stages of the miners’ strike set alarm bells ringing at the highest level of government, the Downing Street files show. The cabinet secretary, Sir Robert Armstrong, told Thatcher he was seriously concerned that it would be “difficult to justify the use of information” obtained by MI5 phonetaps to help the legal sequestrators search and seize the miners’ union’s funds. The threat of public exposure of MI5’s activities came during a legal attempt to seize the National Union of Mineworkers’ funds, which had been spirited away to the Republic of Ireland. The sequestrator involved a partner in Price Waterhouse called Larkins, who had indiscreetly told the Irish lawyers in the case that the names of the bank accounts to which the NUM funds were being transferred had come from a meeting with the cabinet secretary who had been accompanied by “an unnamed name”. Armstrong told Thatcher: “It does not take a Sherlock Holmes to deduce that he was an officer of the security service, and that at least some of his material could have been, and probably was, obtained by interception of communication.” Football Thatcher’s press secretary, Bernard Ingham, wanted to launch a high-profile “goalies against hoolies” campaign involving the prime minister herself in the wake of the 1984-85 English football seasons which had ended in an indefinite ban on English clubs from European matches. The cabinet papers show that government ministers reacted to the death of 39 people in the Heysel stadium riot during the June 1985 European cup final between Liverpool and Juventus with proposals to ban alcohol in football grounds and to introduce membership card schemes. Ingham however advised the prime minister that what was also needed was a public relations campaign to “implant in the public mind the idea that 1984-85 was the low water mark for British soccer; enough is enough”, he told her in a note on 20 June 1985. “A variant of, or added to, this is to try to organise the more articulate goalkeepers, who are often first in line of hooligan fire, to launch a campaign – ‘Goalies against Hoolies’. We are proposing you should give an interview to Gary Bailey, Manchester United and England goalkeeper, from Piccadilly Radio, Manchester – an interview which we should get networked. Bailey is an articulate graduate,” advised Ingham. The note reveals that the idea had come from Elton John, then chairman of Watford football club. Army boots Thatcher was deeply unimpressed by the response of the Ministry of Defence when she took up a complaint about the poor quality of army overboots after visiting the 1st Battalion Coldstream Guards in Northern Ireland. The MoD told her that if there really was a problem with the boots they would have had other complaints. The prime minister went ballistic: “Seldom have I received a more unsatisfactory letter. A bureaucratic gem. I will show it to Anthony Jay,” she scribbled in reply. Anthony Jay was the scriptwriter for the BBC comedy series Yes, Minister. Advertising on the BBC Thatcher suggested that advertising should be introduced on the BBC “light music radio programmes” during 1979, a Downing Street file on the licence fee shows. In December 1984 Thatcher held a meeting with the controller of Radio 3, Ian McIntyre, to discuss advertising on the BBC. McIntyre is described as “one of the few supporters in the BBC hierarchy”. But when the next year Leon Brittan as home secretary proposed the terms of an official inquiry into BBC financing, Thatcher responded: “No, the terms of reference are far too limited. Perhaps I might be consulted?!” 30-year rule Two years of Downing Street and Cabinet Office files – for 1985 and 1986 – have been released together for the first time by the National Archives as part of the move from the 30-year disclosure rule to a 20-year rule governing the release of government papers. The National Archives say recent moves to more rigorous review procedures mean not all 1986 files are available but they intend them to be in the near future. Foreign Office and defence files that have normally been released as part of the annual cabinet papers publication have not been included this year. Mary Whitehouse In August 1986 Douglas Hurd as home secretary defended himself after the moral crusader Mary Whitehouse complained to Thatcher that she had “never been more disappointed by any meeting with a minister”. Hurd had rejected her demand for new obscenity legislation. Thatcher responded to her complaint: “I will, of course, see Mrs Whitehouse. But first I must have a meeting with the Home Office … We have been doing nothing about this subject for years.” Hurd however said Whitehouse had underestimated the difficulties involved in reforming the obscenity laws and her own contributions did little to solve them. “Mrs Whitehouse’s account of our meeting is misleading,” Hurd told Thatcher. “I suspect I started out rather more in sympathy with her point of view than either of my predecessors, but it is hard to sustain this sympathy after experience of her tactics.” ‘Loadsamoney’ culture Britain’s most senior civil servant voiced strong concerns in March 1986 over the first signs of a “loadsamoney” culture developing in the City of London on the eve of the “Big Bang” deregulation of the stock exchange. The cabinet secretary, Sir Robert Armstrong, told Thatcher’s private secretary, Nigel Wicks, he was concerned by the “increasing disquiet” among people who had dealings with the City about what was going on there. “I do not just mean the levels of remuneration; a lot of people, including some from inside the City, think that is a bubble which will be pricked in a year or two. They think more about the way in which corners are being cut and money is being made in ways that are at least bordering on the unscrupulous,” said Armstrong.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Babies born in London hospital 'could leave with wrong mother'", "content": "The biggest hospital in Europe has been ordered to improve security on its maternity ward after inspectors found that mothers “might leave the unit with the wrong baby”. Some babies born at the Royal London hospital had no name tags – which could lead to them going home with the wrong families or even being given medication meant for another baby, according to the Care Quality Commission (CQC). Biggest NHS trust is failing on safety and quality of care, says watchdog Read more Inspectors said there was a “lax” approach to checking babies’ name bands. Even the head of midwifery at the hospital, in Whitechapel, east London, was unaware of a baby abduction policy, the regulator said. Inspectors found there were not enough midwives on the delivery suite to provide safe cover, and midwives said they had been ordered by managers not to raise concerns about low staff numbers. There was a “mixed” view about how caring staff were: one mother told inspectors she was treated as “childish” because she was upset that her baby had been taken into special care. Inspectors who visited the hospital in July this year said they also observed some “intracultural issues and some bullying behaviour” between groups of midwives, and between midwives and patients. Doctors and midwives on the postnatal ward referred to patients by their bed numbers rather than by name, according to the CQC. Last year 4,645 babies were born at the Royal London, which is the largest stand-alone acute hospital in Europe. The CQC has ordered the Barts health NHS trust, which runs the hospital, to improve security in maternity “urgently” after rating the service inadequate. The trust said it had already taken steps to address baby safety concerns, including the introduction of new baby ID tags. Overall the hospital was rated “requires improvement”. Some of the other issues highlighted in the report include: A two-week backlog of outpatient appointments waiting to be booked and some patients waiting for over a year for follow-up appointments. The nutrition and hydration needs of patients were met, though in some busy departments this was enabled by patients’ relatives. Nine “never” events were reported at the hospital between August 2015 and July 2016 – wholly preventable errors. These blunders included a surgeon leaving an object inside a patient after finishing an operation, the extraction of a wrong tooth, “wrong-site implants” and incorrect medication being given to a patient. During the inspection, some patients in A&E had to wait an hour and 20 minutes for an initial assessment from a medic, though national guidance suggests the majority of people should be assessed by a clinician within 15 minutes. Some medics had to complete mandatory training in their own time or during their holiday leave. Professor Sir Mike Richards, chief inspector of hospitals at the CQC, said: “We were most concerned about the standard of care around maternity and gynaecology services. Staffing on maternity wards was sometimes inadequately covered. But most worrying of all was the lack of a safe and secure environment for newborn babies. At the time of our inspection we raised this with the Royal London hospital as a matter for their urgent attention.” A spokeswoman for the trust said: “We acted immediately to improve the security of babies at the Royal London hospital. It’s important to stress that these reports are based on observations from five months ago. Since then we have subjected our processes and procedures to forensic scrutiny. “As a result, we’ve introduced new baby ID tags, we’ve reviewed our procedure for locking down the hospital, and refreshed our policy. We have recirculated our policy to all staff and now test it every single month. Women should be assured our services are safe and we will review our processes regularly to ensure they remain safe.”",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"David Davis hopes Brexit platitudes pass as a Brexit strategy", "content": "First the triumph, then the hubris. David Davis may never have been quite at the delusional Liam Fox end of the spectrum but he was certainly one of the more gung-ho Eurosceptics and his early statements as minister for Brexit tended to be along the lines of “The EU are a bunch of thieving foreigners and the sooner we’re rid of them the better”. Now that he’s been in the job for a few months, he’s begun to show signs of realising it’s all going to be a bit trickier than he had imagined. The smile is still just about in place, but the face is more care-worn. “Would you consider yourself one of the thoughtful politicians?” asked chair Hilary Benn, at the start of Davis’s first appearance before his Brexit select committee, echoing chancellor Philip Hammond’s remarks earlier in the week that all thoughtful politicians believed transitional arrangements would be required once the two-year negotiating period was up. Davis thought about this for a while, before coming to the conclusion that though he may not yet be thoughtful he had moved up the synaptic food chain to totally indecisive. Which was progress of a sort. He couldn’t say when the government would have a plan other than it definitely wouldn’t be within the next month as he had 57 sectoral analyses to complete. Some of which were barely under way. Nor could he promise a white paper, nor how many pages the plan would be. It all depended on the font size. “We just want everything to run smoothly,” he said, hoping that platitudes might be mistaken for thoughtfulness. “What if everything can’t be negotiated within 18 months?” Benn pressed on, more out of duty than from any expectation of enlightenment. “Will transitional arrangements be implemented then?” “Transitional means a lot of things to different people,” Davis blustered. “Are you opposed to transitional arrangements?” Benn said, only just resisting the urge to head-butt the table. “That depends on what you mean by transitional.” Being this thoughtful was turning out to be hard work. “It’s on record...” “I never gossip,” insisted Davis. At which point even he realised he had gone too far, as the Brexit minister has a reputation for doing little but. “Do you worry about going over a cliff edge?” Davis closed his eyes. He wasn’t really sure if he was meant to be that bothered about going over a cliff edge or not. Obviously it wouldn’t be a great idea to rush headlong off the cliff but if everyone was to line up in an orderly fashion and then jump off the cliff, surely that couldn’t be too bad? “I don’t know if we would have transitional plans as such but we might have some implementation plans that we would implement if we needed to implement them,” he said, pensively. The longer the session went on, the vaguer Davis became. Something no one in the room had previously believed possible. On the customs union there weren’t just four general spectrums to think about, there were also a multitude of little-known side spectrums. On immigration he wasn’t prepared to commit to anything. If Britain needed some Nobel prize-winning fruit pickers then let them come. Now that he had come to think of it, taking back control could just mean taking back control to increase immigration. At the same time as reducing it, obviously. Michael Gove started twitching, unable to believe that one of his fellow Brexiteers was showing every sign of going over to the Dark Side of the Remoaners. And when Davis started to talk about how the EU negotiation would be a two-way process and that Britain wouldn’t necessarily be able to dictate the terms on which it left, Gove could control himself no longer. “We can do whatever we want,” he ranted. “The EU needs us far more than we need them.” Exterminate. Exterminate. Benn summoned a nurse to administer Mikey with a sedative. It had been a long afternoon for everyone. Enough was enough.",diasaster:0},

The cold war Soviet minister Andrei Gromyko, known as “grim Grom”, was most famous for this. What makes celebrity meltdowns entertainment instead of tragedy? | David Ferguson Read more But his crown has surely been taken by Kanye West, who posed next to Donald Trump after their meeting this week at Trump Tower. He managed a few smiles. But by and large he had, as they say in Yorkshire, a face like a smacked arse. As Donald grinned insistently, Kanye looked like someone had taken his pet goldfish out of its bowl, laid it on the driveway and done some flamenco-style stomping on it. When asked what they discussed, Trump said: “Life.” West later said he raised issues including bullying and violence. Of course, it is possible that the Donald had promised to tackle these – but only if Kanye sang at his inauguration. So Kanye had to find a way of changing the subject: “Will you  sing at my inauguration, Kanye?” – “Life, Donald. Life. Isn’t life a heckuva thing? Life.” – “No, but will you? Will you endure a lifetime’s social media shame and sing at my inauguration?” – “Oh, Mr President-Elect. Life is such a business. Life is something to think about. Look at the way the sun is streaming through the windows.” Playground tactics No one can remember a time when pundits were not piously declaring that the public had had enough of “yah-boo politics”. But the public loves yah-boo politics. Trump/Brexit is the epitome of yah-boo politics. And the prime minister’s tetchy chief of staff, Fiona Hill, has kept this political tradition alive, having famously texted the petulant taunt “So there!” to the former minister Nicky Morgan after a debate about Theresa May’s leather trousers. Whichever of them leaked this spat to the press evidently considers herself to have had the last word and to be therefore the winner. It is interesting to see that these juvenile expressions still have currency: in 1975, Edward Heath responded to requests for help from the new Conservative leader, Margaret Thatcher, by snapping “Shan’t!” and “Won’t!” What Nicky Morgan should have texted back to Fiona Hill was, of course: 'You smell – no returns!' What Morgan should have texted back to Hill was of course: “You smell – no returns.” But maybe this kind of badinage is now headed for the dustbin of cultural history. Discussions with my 12-year-old reveal that nowadays playground quarrels take the form of cutting remarks on each other’s Instagram feeds. Hill should have just commented on Morgan’s picture of a sunset: “OMG Juno filter is rubbish.” Islands in the steam However bad things have got in 2016, there is still time to dip to a new low. And that may come this week, when Vladimir Putin takes his clothes off for the cameras – yet again (he isn’t averse to revealing his pecs, sometimes astride a horse). This week, he meets the Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, in the premier’s hometown of Nagato. They are expected to get their kit off – most of it – and climb into a hot spring bath or onsen, thought to encourage “naked communion”. This, it is hoped, will get Putin to loosen up and agree to give the Kuril Islands, in the Pacific, back to Japan – Soviet troops having claimed them at the end of the second world war. Whenever I have got into a hot tub with strangers, it just feels uncomfortable. I wouldn’t feel like returning any islands. Cameras may be there to record the event – but perhaps Putin will take pity on us and wear a discreet spa-style towelling dressing gown, and remove it only when the photographers have left.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Brexit plan will not be published before February, says David Davis", "content": "Britain will not have a Brexit plan until February but should be able to complete talks within 18 months and then go through a transitional phase of leaving the EU if necessary, David Davis has said. The Brexit secretary gave the clearest indications so far of the government’s thinking on how to leave the bloc, including that it will refuse to allow the EU any control over the UK’s immigration policy, as he appeared before the House of Commons committee on exiting the European Union. He said triggering article 50 before the end of March would set Britain on a straight path towards Brexit that would be “very, very difficult to revoke” but he also acknowledged the possibility of reversing the decision. Government lawyers have argued that the article 50 process is irreversible and the UK would be legally bound to leave after that point. However, Davis suggested it could be feasible, though the chance is remote. David Davis says government's Brexit plan will not be published until February - Politics live Read more “There is a viewpoint, I think, which is only really fading, among some Europeans, that we can’t really mean this, that we can be persuaded to change our minds,” he said. “One of the virtues of the article 50 process [once it is started], it’s very difficult seeing it being revoked. We don’t intend to revoke it.” He added: “It may not be revocable – I don’t know.” After Theresa May relented to Labour and backbench Tory pressure to publish a plan for Brexit, Davis said it would be released as soon as possible but there were “quite a few decisions still to be made” about the way Downing Street wants to leave the EU, including the impact on business sectors, justice and home affairs. “It certainly won’t be next month,” he told MPs. Despite the lack of a firm plan, Davis gave a series of hints about the direction of travel and argued that “everything is negotiable” within a year and a half of the formal article 50 notification in March. The deal would then take about six months to be agreed by European leaders, the European parliament and the British parliament. His tone was slightly different from that of Philip Hammond, the chancellor, who said earlier this week that all “thoughtful politicians” were clearly in favour of striking a transitional deal with the EU to cushion companies from the possible consequences of Brexit. There have been growing calls from business groups such as the CBI and the banks for a transitional period to smooth the Brexit process but Downing Street has so far refused to confirm it will seek this from the EU. Davis’s comments on immigration came as the prime minister prepared to travel to Brussels for an EU summit on Thursday at which she was expected to use the UK’s influence to shape EU migration policy while Britain remains a member of the bloc. A Downing Street official said: “There is a while yet while we will still be at the table [at the EU] and we think there are things we can be doing now to... reduce the numbers coming to Europe.” Speaking at the hearing, Davis said the UK was not opposed to transitional arrangements if they amounted to a Brexit “implementation phase” but only if it was really necessary and after the deal had been nailed down. “Whatever the transitional arrangement is, we need to know where we’re going before we decide on the transition,” he said. “It seems to me that it will be perfectly possible to know what the endgame will be in two years.” In terms of the UK’s demands, Davis said he was looking at different models for customs arrangements but taking control of immigration would be non-negotiable in talks, so the EU would have no say over whether its citizens have preferential access. “What we have to bear in mind is that we have to pay respects to the outcome of the referendum, and therefore it’s got to be clear control by this parliament,” he said. Asked if he thought discussion of issues like preferential, skills-based migration for EU citizens would feature in the negotiations, Davis said: “No, I don’t. I think that the operation of that decision after we have left the EU will be in the national interest and that will affect all levels of skill – the judgment that the government comes to as to what’s necessary for universities, what’s necessary for business, and what’s necessary for fruit picking.” Davis ran through four possibilities on the UK’s membership of the customs union: being fully in, fully out, a partially inside Turkish model of being inside the customs union but outside the single market, and a Swiss model of being outside the customs union but with customs arrangements. He revealed the government was looking at the Norway-Sweden border as a possible model for how the border could work between Ireland and Northern Ireland. Pressed by MPs about whether the UK could really pay for access to the single market after the end of transitional arrangements, he said he wanted to keep his options open. Davis made clear that the UK would seek a trade deal at the same time as negotiations over exiting under article 50, but that preventing non-tariff barriers to services was probably more important than stopping the imposition of tariffs to goods. At a separate hearing of the Commons business committee, Greg Clark, the business secretary, told MPs that the government persuaded Nissan to commit to its Sunderland plant by reassuring the Japanese carmaker that it would try to secure tariff-free access to the single market for its UK operations. It comes as May hosted rebel Tory MPs pushing for the UK to stay as close as possible to the single market, whose group has gained the nickname the “new bastards” after the anti-European MPs who caused trouble for John Major in the 1990s. They are calling for the prime minister to set out her strategy for Brexit in a white paper, but Davis told the hearing on Wednesday that the format and degree of detail had not yet been decided. Responding to his appearance, the Tory MP Neil Carmichael, a supporter of Open Britain, said:“The government should bring forward their substantive plans in a white paper, which David Davis himself suggested before he joined the cabinet. “There is a mandate to leave the EU but there is no mandate for a hard, destructive Brexit. The terms on which we leave should be subject to rigorous debate and scrutiny – in parliament and the country.” The government could publish the letter it sent to Nissan reassuring them about Brexit once concerns about commercial sensitivity had passed, Clark told MPs. The letter contains confidential information that could be used by the carmakers’ rivals, he said.",diasaster:0},

{ "title":"Government considers allowing learner drivers on motorways", "content": "Learner drivers could be allowed on motorways for the first time, under government proposals aimed at increasing road safety. The Department for Transport is considering the move as a way to make sure learners are properly prepared for everyday driving before they pass their tests. Under the plans, they would be allowed to gain experience on motorways under the supervision of an approved driving instructor. At the moment, learner drivers are not allowed to go on motorways but can do so without having had any practical experience after passing their test. The possibility of learners on motorways will be explored under a £2m project examining driver education. It will look at whether the current regime gives the best training for learner and novice drivers. Compulsory basic training for learner motorcyclists will also be reviewed. Why the London Cycling Campaign designed a bike-friendly lorry Read more As part of a package of reforms known as the road safety plan, transport ministers are also planning a £50m grant for better cycling training in schools, and looking at forcing lorries to keep their sideguards to better protect cyclists. There will also be increased punishments for drivers who use hand-held mobile devices while driving, with an increase from three penalty points to four and the fine rising from £100 to £150. In 2014, mobile phone usage was a contributing factor in 21 fatal road accidents and 84 serious accidents. The penalty for using a mobile while driving larger vehicles such as HGVs will go up from three to six points. Patrick McLoughlin, the transport secretary, said he was putting forward “common sense proposals that balance tougher penalties for dangerous drivers with practical steps to help youngsters and other more vulnerable groups stay safe on our roads”. The move to let learner drivers have supervised practice on motorways was welcomed by Steve Gooding, director of the RAC Foundation. “One in five young drivers has an accident within six months of passing their test so putting the learning process under the spotlight has to be a good thing,” he said. “Mile for mile, motorways are our safest roads but can be intimidating places for novice drivers. Exploring ways of letting learners have controlled access to them is welcome. The important thing is the official seal of approval provided by the approved driving instructor who will accompany them down the slip road. This is definitely not the time to have mum or dad in the passenger seat.” The government is currently considering a number of reforms to driving tests in order to improve the UK’s road safety record. It is already thinking about giving those who pass their driving test first time a refund of part of the cost. The plan is intended to raise the low first-time pass rate, which stands at just 21%. At one point, the government was also considering banning newly qualified drivers from carrying non-family members under proposals to cut the number of road accidents involving teenagers.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Rail passengers need help with refunds, says Which?", "content": "Rail passengers are routinely left in the dark by train companies over the compensation or refunds they should receive for delays, according to Which?. The consumer group is demanding action from the Office of Rail and Road (ORR) to investigate train operators after finding that only a fraction of those entitled to refunds receive them or are informed how to process a claim. Many passengers are still offered vouchers, it said, although cash refunds should have been available since July this year. The organisation has made a super-complaint, a power which allows designated bodies to complain to regulators on behalf of consumers and receive a formal response. According to Which?, the latest ORR data suggests almost 47m passenger journeys were either cancelled or significantly late in one year. Its survey of nearly 7,000 rail passengers found that only a third of those who may have been entitled to compensation said they actually made a claim – and only marginally more recalled being informed of their rights to do so after their last delay. “Mystery shoppers” from the organisation who surveyed 102 train stations found fewer than one in five gave out a full explanation for the conditions for claiming a refund, and more than three in five did not say they would be entitled to a cash refund, even when directly asked. Compensation for late trains has proved to be a thorny issue, with unions accusing operators of pocketing hundreds of millions of pounds claimed from Network Rail in recent years when a problem on the track has delayed a service, rather than passing it back to their customers. Automatic compensation for delayed passengers who had pre-booked journeys online with a credit card was introduced by Virgin earlier this year. Other operators are to introduce schemes to automatically repay commuters with season tickets for late running trains, led by National Express on its C2C network from February next year. Which? executive director Richard Lloyd, said: “Current proposals to improve compensation for passengers are too far down the track. Even if an automatic compensation system was included in all new franchises from tomorrow, it would take until at least 2025 to cover the whole network. “Millions of passengers are left out of pocket each year, so train companies must do more to put their passengers first and make rail refunds easier.” The ORR said that its own research also showed passengers were only dimly aware of how and when to claim compensation, and that there had been moves to improve the system. The ORR said: “Passengers are entitled to compensation when they do not receive the service they have paid for. The industry has recently taken positive steps – such as signing up to a code of practice on providing clear information to passengers when they buy rail tickets, which includes their compensation rights. We will be assessing whether more could and should be done for passengers as we investigate this complaint.” The Rail Delivery Group, which represents train operators and Network Rail, said compensation was becoming more generous and easy to obtain. He said: “The changes giving people the option to receive compensation in cash if they prefer is just one example of our commitment to giving passengers an even better deal. “Train operators are doing lots more to inform passengers about when they are entitled to claim and how, including more announcements on trains, handing out claim forms or using Twitter and emailing reminders to people who booked online.” The ORR has 90 days to examine and respond to Which?’s findings.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Government’s miserable record on energy policy", "content": "The business leaders, academics and environmentalists warning that we need a major U-turn in UK energy policy (Government ‘must change course’ after climate pact, 14 December) were clearly correct. They were focusing rightly on the need for renewables and energy conservation to meet greenhouse gas emissions targets. But it is also worth focusing on how we need many of the environmental measures that the government has cut back, delayed or abolished for economic and social reasons. George Osborne has understandably stopped talking about rebalancing the economy – given his patent failure to achieve that in five years as chancellor – but effective policies to support wind and tidal power offer design and manufacturing opportunities for British business that are currently being squandered. The rest of the world is powering ahead on renewables, and we’re being left behind. Small- and medium-sized enterprises around the country who’ve invested in training staff – and could be taking on many more apprentices to improve Britain’s skill base – for solar installation and home energy efficiency could be given a secure future by a sensible response to the feed-in tariff consultation and a recognition that housing is part of our national infrastructure and desperately needs investment. That investment could tackle Britain’s awful, indefensible excess winter deaths – the reality that many people, particularly older people, are in homes that are impossible, or too expensive, to heat, and are dying and suffering serious ill health as a consequence. Investment in local public transport – buses, local trains, walking and cycling – could tackle social exclusion (two-thirds of jobseekers don’t have access to a car), cut the toll of air pollution deaths, and reduce the pressure on the NHS from obesity and diabetes. Support for community energy schemes would not only give us a decentralised, resilient energy supply but ensure people can invest in their local communities, and keep that money circulating locally, rather than swishing off into tax havens. In short, tackling climate change isn’t a cost to bear but an opportunity to rework our economy and society so that it creates jobs people can build a life on, ensures households are warm and comfortable and communities prosperous, and our air is breathable. Natalie Bennett Green party leader • The idea that this government is likely to be shamed by charges of hypocrisy “unless it does a U-turn on energy policy” is one of the more bizarre assertions to appear on your front page. Cameron, Osborne, Hunt, Duncan Smith and most of the cabinet feed us a constant diet of hypocrisy. Just because it is marginally less bombastic than Donald Trump’s doesn’t make it any less toxic. Brian Woolland Winchester  • Amber Rudd (Warning of 18,000 job losses as solar subsidies cut, 18 December) takes the misuse of the egregious mantra “hard-working families” to a new low when she proclaims her “priority is to ensure energy bills for hard-working families are kept as low as possible”. Presumably non-working householders, including pensioners, don’t count in this lame excuse for abandoning the government’s climate change policies. Jeremy Beecham Labour, House of Lords • The final report of the Task Force on Shale Gas on which you report (Government accused of climate change U-turns, 15 December) concludes, inter alia, that: shale gas “can be produced safely and usefully in the UK provided that the government insists on industry-leading standards”. In my evidence to the taskforce, I raised the concerns over radon risks from fracking, as extensively aired in the US but barely at all in the UK, and the health hazards posed by endocrine disrupter chemicals – so called “gender-bender” chemical additives – used in fracking fluids. Two years ago this month, academic researchers at the University of Missouri, released the results of research they had conducted into the known chemicals used in fracking, which found higher levels of hormone-disrupting activity in water located near fracking wells than in areas without drilling. On radon gas risks, the taskforce defers to the expertise of Public Health England, whose final report on the review of the potential public health impacts of exposures to chemical and radioactive pollutants as a result of shale gas extraction process – published in October 2014 – states: “If the natural gas delivery point were to be close to the extraction point with a short transit time, radon present in the natural gas would have little time to decay … there is therefore the potential for radon gas to be present in natural gas extracted from UK shale.” In the taskforce’s second interim report, published in July this year, it looked at the impacts of shale gas associated with the local environment, including potential impacts on air and water and on public health impacts. No mention is made of the critical evidence I submitted. I have no faith whatever in the credibility of this taskforce, which was fully funded by the fracking industry.

{ "title":"Home Office interpreters threaten boycott over pay cut", "content": "The system for processing immigration claims across the country is set to grind to a halt in the new year if a threatened mass boycott by Home Office interpreters goes ahead. The looming action in protest at pay cuts is the first time the estimated 2,000 interpreters have threatened to stop work. The organisers of a fair pay campaign – who are running it anonymously for fear of reprisals by the Home Office – say that so far they have received solid support from several hundred interpreters. A meeting with Home Office bosses has been scheduled for 11am on Monday to discuss their concerns. The problems began when interpreters received an email on 20 November from the Home Office central interpreters unit in Liverpool informing them that a pay cut would be introduced from 1 January. Interpreters receive £16 an hour on weekdays and slightly more at the weekend. But the first hour’s work is paid at an enhanced rate to recognise the time and cost of travelling to appointments. That first-hour rate is being cut from £48 to £32 on weekdays and from £72 to £46 at weekends. Interpreters are expected to travel up to three hours each way without extra payments from the Home Office. They attend meetings between asylum seekers and others interacting with immigration officials, and translate interview questions and answers face to face. The pay cuts will apply to various areas of the Home Office’s work, including UK Visas and Immigration, Border Force, Immigration Enforcement and HM Passport Office. Public service staff face four more years of pay pain Read more The interpreters say they have not had a pay rise since at least 2002, so in real terms have already taken a sizeable cut. But this is the first time the Home Office has proposed lowering their wages. Home Office interpreters are highly trained and have to go through counter-terrorism security clearance, meaning it will not be easy to substitute other interpreters at short notice if the boycott takes effect. The plan is to start the boycott on 1 January and to follow it with a series of walkouts after that. “There is no strike planned because, as freelancers, we cannot legally do so. We may, however, choose not to accept assignments and that is what the boycott will consist of,” said one of the interpreters organising the action. “At the moment, the Home Office needs interpreters more than we need them. They do not have any other system currently in place to substitute our services other than for telephone interpreting, which they can outsource to thebigword [an online firm]. They know that if we boycott even for a day, that will cause major disruptions to their business.” The interpreters have written to the Home Office to express their dismay at the pay cut. “This decision came out of the blue; there had been no consultation nor any forewarning of a reduction in our fees,” the letter says. “The fees paid to us have remained unchanged since at least 2002, when the current rates came into effect, whilst being eroded by 3.5% annually due to inflation. “In view of this, any further reductions are totally unacceptable. Instead … the Home Office should do the right thing and seriously consider increasing the rates of payment to account for the effects of inflation, just as the Home Office has done with their staff’s salaries for the last 12 years, other than three of them.” The organisers of the campaign have complained that they were not consulted over the changes, but Home Office officials say consultation was not required before the changes were made, in line with the terms of the interpreters’ contract. Some interpreters have expressed concern about being blacklisted by the Home Office if they raise concerns about pay cuts. But the organisers of the protest say they have received assurances from the central interpreting unit in Liverpool that raising concerns about pay will have no bearing on the number of bookings interpreters receive from the department. Another interpreter, who also did not want to be named, said: “The Home Office cannot function without us. They will not be able to process any immigration claims if we go ahead with our boycott.” She said the interpreters were very loyal to the Home Office but often were not treated well. In some centres they are not allowed to use the same toilets as Home Office staff, she said. “Sometimes we are looked down on. This pay reduction is a huge insult and the time has come to protest,” she added. A Home Office spokesperson said: “We keep our costs under constant review to ensure the contractors we use offer the best value for money for the taxpayer. As part of this, we have considered the rates at which interpreters are paid and have made some changes, which are effective from 1 January. “This information was shared with contractors several weeks ago. We are aware some interpreters have raised concerns about this and we have met with them to discuss why the changes are necessary.”",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"British workers may wait a decade for wages to recover, says TUC boss", "content": "British workers may have to wait a decade to see their pay recover to pre-crisis levels, says the head of the Trades Union Congress. Wages are now rising faster than inflation for the first time in six years, according to official data, but the TUC – the umbrella body for Britain’s trade union movement – is warning that workers will have to wait until 2024 before they make up lost ground. Frances O’Grady, the TUC’s general secretary, said: “What is clear is that it will take a decade for wages to catch up in real terms to where they were before the crash. There are a lot of people who are now dipping into their savings – or, worse, getting into debt, to try to maintain a standard of living.” TUC research says the real value of the average full-time employee wage fell by £487 in 2014 and has fallen by £2,509 since 2010 – a decline of about £50 a week. O’Grady told the Guardian the long road to recovery risked stoking the same credit-fuelled boom that paved the way for the economic crash. “I don’t think most people can afford to wait. This is important not just for families, but for the economy. We need a wages-led recovery, otherwise we are going to end up in exactly the same mess that we started with – with families getting into debt they can’t afford to repay.” With less than six months before the 2015 general election, O’Grady said the coalition government had “a pretty poor record from the perspective of working people”. She said the government had failed to deliver by its own standards, having missed targets on deficit reduction and borrowing. But it had also fuelled inequality and failed to tackle multinational corporations that avoid paying their “fair share” of UK taxes. “We know that if they got re-elected there is a lot worse to come, with 60% of the cuts still to hit,” she said. According to the government’s independent forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility, George Osborne’s economic plans mean “a very sharp spending squeeze”, with 60% of the cuts to fall in the next parliament. The TUC has been in the vanguard of anti-austerity protests, most recently leading NHS workers in a pay strike. At stake are the living standards of the NHS’s 1.3 million workers, after the government disregarded the advice of the NHS pay review body, which recommended a 1% pay rise for all staff in 2014-15. O’Grady expects to lead NHS workers back on to the picket lines in late January or early February, but said: “We are always ready to talk.” She said the standoff had shown her that the government had “a complete lack of respect for people who work for a living”, and that set it apart even from Margaret Thatcher’s administration. “She felt the need to appeal to ordinary people in a way that I am not sure this government does.” She said today’s Tories were “at least as rightwing and in some cases more so” than in Thatcher’s era. Osborne’s hopes to cut government spending to levels last seen in the 1930s – described by leading tax experts as “a fundamental reimagining of the state” – could run into deep public opposition, O’Grady said. “This is really punishing the poor.” “Clearly there are elements in the current Conservative party leadership that are determined to push through such a radical programme. “Whether others have the stomach for it or whether it would be acceptable by this country I don’t know. It is a nightmare scenario. “I suspect that if they did try to push through cuts at the level that they plan then we would see a good deal more resistance.” O’Grady said the UK was on the brink of “the most important general election we face in a generation”. However, she said she thought the Labour leader, Ed Miliband, still needed to convince people on the details of his economic plan. “We need to generate some more confidence and hope that there is a different way to rebuild Britain.” Some Labour party insiders have criticised Miliband for not doing enough to shore up the party’s economic credibility, but O’Grady counselled him to hold his nerve. “He was right to make living standards the main focus of Labour’s programme and he needs to build confidence that Labour will have bold policies to address the problems that we face.” But she said she wanted to see more detail on “an intelligent industrial strategy” to develop industries and good jobs, as well as redistribution. “What we want to see in the new year is a clear plan, not just for growth, but for building a fair economy that delivers for working people. And we want that plan to spell out clearly how we get investment, how we tackle our poor productivity record, how we boost exports and how we distribute fair shares of the wealth that we produce.”",diasaster:0},

John Cridland also called for radical reform of the education system and the European Union. In his new year message, he pressed the case for cementing the UK’s reputation as one of the best places to do business. He said: “For business leaders, deficit reduction is a must for the next government. “The main political parties are in agreement on the need for action but seem reluctant to be upfront on the major structural changes needed to prevent public services suffering decline through a thousand cuts. “All political parties need to give as much attention to how they will run government as to what government should do. “Post-autumn-statement, the same approach to public service reform is no longer an option. Much of the low-hanging fruit is long since gone and only radical solutions will deliver. “Let’s see the integration of health and social care, and a significant increase in services available online.” Cridland outlined changes to the education system such as the scrapping of GCSEs for 16-year-olds and introducing a “personal menu” of learning plans for teenagers, offering a mix of academic and vocational A-levels. “By boosting skills we will see productivity rise – along with earnings,” he said. The CBI leader said most of his members wanted to remain in a reformed EU, adding: “We need less EU – no more lifestyle regulation on matters like employment, such as the working time directive, which should be left to member states, and no more damaging regulations on UK financial services that are vital to fuelling growth across Europe. “Political isolationism would leave us poorer. The majority of CBI member companies of all sizes want to remain in a reformed EU.” Cridland called on the UK to sign more trade deals. He said that while the UK economy was among those achieving the fastest growth in the G7 – with 2.5% growth predicted in 2015 – there were risks. “The political and economic risks at home and abroad represent a clear and present danger. As the election countdown accelerates, I urge politicians of all hues not to take their eyes off the economic ball,” Cridland said.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Poetry in motion: mobile site brings new audience to African writers", "content": "“These days, the language of death is a dialect of betrayals; the bodies broken, placid as saints, hobble along the tiled corridors, from room to room. Below the dormitories is a white squat bungalow, a chapel from which the handclaps and choruses rise and reach us like the scent of a more innocent time.” These are the opening lines of Hope’s Hospice, written by Ghanaian-born Jamaican poet Kwame Dawes. He is among nearly 400 African poets from 24 countries in 14 languages who can now be heard reading their work via mobile phones – a first for Africa and the world. The mobile site, accessible on smart and feature phones, has been launched by the Badilisha Poetry X-Change, the biggest archive of audio recordings by African poets in the world. It is a significant step on this “mobile first” continent where, with limited landline infrastructure, most people access the internet through their phones rather than on computers. Linda Kaoma, project manager of Badilisha, based in Cape Town, South Africa, said: “We realised we weren’t achieving our goal of reaching a whole audience in Africa. We’ve created a mobile site that can be accessed on almost any phone you have. The response has been great.” Badilisha appears to suggest Africa’s ancient tradition of oral poetry sits more comfortably in the 21st-century technology of the podcast than in mainstream publishing. Kaoma said: “A lot of publishers are not publishing poetry, but it does not have to be confined to books. It’s alive. The voice adds texture, adds a different layer to the poems. A lot of people are enjoying listening to poetry rather than reading it. We need to change the way we present ourselves to audiences, and audiences need to be aware of different ways of receiving poetry.” Badilisha began life in 2008 as an annual poetry festival in Cape Town featuring poets from all over Africa and the diaspora. The website came four years later from a desire to reach listeners and readers across the continent, and preserve the work for posterity. Kaoma said: “If you look at Europe it’s very easy to find archives of many things but in Africa, because of a lot of history and culture was passed down by the oral tradition, and there was lack of documentation, that’s not possible. We didn’t want history to repeat itself.” The site, which has about 3,000 visitors a month, was relaunched last October with new features such as guests’ top 10 poets and mobile access. It represents a much-needed boost on a continent where performance poets can be found in large cities but few have hopes of publishing a collection in print. Kaoma said: “The poets love it. It’s a great place to come and reflect and see what other poets are doing. I think there is value in being influenced by someone in the same context: you don’t have to change yourself to be recognised. You can be African and write about whatever you want to write about.” The 29-year-old said her education was dominated by Shakespeare and she only started encountering African poets when she became involved in Badilisha. She now gives poetry readings internationally. “It’s great to travel to Ghana and Kenya and find a poet writing about what I want to write about. We’re not as one dimensional as people paint us to be. We’re very diverse.” Badilisha’s poets include 169 from South Africa, 33 from Kenya, 27 from Nigeria, 26 from Zimbabwe, three from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and one from Somalia. Among the 16 African poets in the UK is Lemn Sissay, of Ethiopian descent, who was commissioned to write for the 2012 London Olympics. He can be heard reading his work The Queen’s Speech. Each poet has a page with photograph, biography and poems in text and audio. Only a handful of dead poets have been archived so far but there are plans to expand this in coming months, using either a relative of the poet or an actor to perform the readings. Badilisha has two full-time staff and is funded mainly by the Spier Wine Farm in Stellenbosch, near Cape Town, along with some government support. Among the writers featured is Mbali Kgosidintsi, 31, from Botswana, who can be heard reading I Stand Between My Africa and Me. She said: “They really are pioneers. They are publishing poetry online and creating an African network. It’s a high standard of poets and the fact I can refer someone to Badilisha, and say I’m published on the site, is great.” The site has triggered debate about the health of poetry in Africa. Kgosidintsi, who has taken part in an African poetry festival in Beijing, China, said: “People definitely want to perform poetry but I worry that the fact that we don’t publish it, and when we do publish, we don’t sell.” Another poet on the site, South African Natalia Molebatsi, told the eNews Channel Africa: “We can’t say it’s mainstream and we’re not really trying to make it mainstream. All we’re doing is trying to share our work. Remember, it is one of the most ancient art forms. This initiative has given me an opportunity to express myself and share my work with other people.”",diasaster:0},

But one market stallholder was confronted with not one but two. “Finding two at once is extremely rare,” said oyster farmer Malika Molen who sold the molluscs at Saint-Jory market near Toulouse a couple of Sundays ago. “He’s one of my regular customers. He always buys two dozen – one to eat while standing at his couscous stall, and the other to take home.” The wild pearls were in two oysters from Arcachon Bay, south-west France, which the stallholder took home. “The next Sunday he brought them back to show me,” said Molen, from La Teste-de-Buch on south shore of the bay. In fresh water, pearls can take between 12 months and six years to form, while the formation of saltwater pearls takes much longer. Molen’s oysters mature in seawater in the bay. Molen charges €7.50 (£5.80) a dozen at the market where she has had a stall for 32 years. So could the lucky customer strike it rich? Depending on their size, quality and lustre, wild pearls can be valuable. But the ones found in the Arcachon Bay oysters were only likely to “have a sentimental value, not a commercial” one because they tended to only be the size of a large pinhead, said Molen. “But still, it’s a nice Christmas present. It’s the pleasure of the discovery.” It was not unusual to come across them, she added. “My children found one, this year seems to be quite propitious.”",diasaster:0},

Cabin crew in BA’s mixed fleet unit – who represent about 15% of stewards at the airline – voted to strike after rejecting a 2% pay offer on what the Unite union has described as “poverty pay” levels. BA accused Unite of creating uncertainty for passengers over the festive season and said it would attempt to resolve the dispute without causing disruption. Union representatives will meet over the next two days to decide what action to take, with a strike possible at any date from 21 December. Unite balloted about 2,500 staff at Heathrow, with a 79% vote to strike on a 60% turnout. All of BA’s new flight crew members are recruited into the mixed fleet branch, which was set up in 2010 on lower pay and conditions than existing crew. The mixed fleet group operates on long-haul and short-haul flights from Britain’s biggest airport. BA boss shocked to find out that third Heathrow runway will raze his HQ Read more Average pay, including allowances, is just £16,000 a year for cabin crew, according to the union, although BA said crew would normally make at least £21,000 a year with bonuses. Basic salary is £12,000 a year – a figure that has led some to resort to moonlighting in other jobs or sleeping in their cars between shifts to survive, the union said. The mixed fleet considered a strike in 2014, with discontent stoked by the differential in pay between new recruits and company bosses. Willie Walsh, the chief executive of BA’s parent company, IAG, earned £6.5m in 2015. The airline group is forecasting annual profits of €2.5bn (£2.3bn), largely driven by BA. Unite’s regional officer Matt Smith said the BA cabin crew were “at breaking point”. He added: “Mixed fleet crew earn just over the minimum wage and below the national average. Significant numbers of crew are taking on second jobs, many go to work unfit to fly because they can’t afford to be sick. British Airways bosses need to wake up to the anger and the injustice here.” Smith said low pay was not just indefensible but a safety issue for aviation. “Inexperience, fatigue, and the fact that BA recently cut the length of crew training courses means Unite is genuinely concerned about the potential repercussions.” BA said the airline had made an offer that would lead to basic pay and hourly duty rates increasing by a minimum of 7%. A spokesperson for the airline said: “We are extremely disappointed that the union is creating uncertainty for our customers. Mixed fleet Unite represents about 15% of our cabin crew. “We remain focused on resolving this issue as quickly as possible without any disruption to customers. We have proposed a fair and reasonable pay increase to mixed fleet cabin crew, which is in line with that accepted by other British Airways colleagues and which will ensure their reward levels remain in line with cabin crew at our airline competitors.” Smith said: “We urge British Airways to avoid this dispute and do the right thing by both the frontline staff and the travelling public, by engaging with Unite to negotiate a genuinely meaningful way forward.” The airline was the site of Britain’s most prolonged and bitter strikes of recent years, when cabin crew walked out for 22 days between 2010 and 2011, a dispute that cost the airline about £150m. BA rival Virgin Atlantic may also see flights affected over Christmas and the New Year.

Sometimes, to save her life, theguardian.com, 7 December). Copenhagen sex ambulance is safe space for capital’s red-light workers Read more Violence against women is one of the factors at play when female sex workers are killed. But large amounts of evidence from around the world have shown that another major factor is the criminalisation of those involved in the sex industry. Ingala Smith isolated the death of Daria Pionko here in Leeds as a reason why the purchase of sex should be criminalised. Pionko was murdered since the development of a new approach to street sex work – women can work in a designated area of the city without being prosecuted for soliciting. What Ingala Smith didn’t mention was that four sex workers have been killed in Leeds since 1990, three under a policy of criminalisation of sex workers and buyers. Pionko was a migrant sex worker. Of 18 UK sex workers murdered since 2013, more than half have been migrant women, indicating a targeting of vulnerability exacerbated by criminalisation and stigmatisation. Under the new approach we have seen a 10-fold increase in crimes against sex workers reported to police, and have secured convictions for violent crimes never achieved before. The Femicide Census is all about understanding the killings of women in context. It was a shame to see the context of sex worker murders stripped away to argue for the criminalisation of sex buyers, a policy that has such a weak evidence base.

But after the air campaign gave way to a ground offensive earlier this month, Iran’s proxies took the lead, giving them a driving role in what happens next. According a spokesman for one of the Aleppo factions, the ceasefire was immediately in doubt after Iran imposed conditions the rebels could not meet. Yasser al-Youssef, of the Noureddine al-Zenki militia said Iran’s demands included the lifting of a rebel siege on Shia villages in Idlib, province, as well as deals on prisoners and missing members of Iranian-backed militias. “Iran has prepared to invade our besieged areas and has defied Russia’s agreement,” said al-Youssef. Iran and the Syrian government do not want to compromise on the battlefield or at the negotiating table, believing that total domination will give them a better hand to shape the aftermath. Russia, on the other hand, sees a benefit in transitioning from bludgeoning superpower to peace-broker. The clash is the first serious divergence between Tehran and Moscow, whose heavyweight interventions have saved Assad but greatly diminished Syria’s sovereignty. But with the endgame in sight, the “win first, settle up later” approach has reached a nadir. Sectarian fighters mass for battle to capture east Aleppo Read more Iran’s role in the Aleppo crisis is set to dominate Thursday’s regular meeting of EU heads of state in Brussels, with leaders of the Syrian opposition calling for economic sanctions to be imposed on Russia and Iran. The EU, increasingly marginal to a crisis being resolved by Russia, Iran and Turkey , is certain to make it clear that it will not supply any cash for economic reconstruction unless there is a negotiated political settlement – and not a military resolution imposed by Iran or the Syrian government. In a letter to EU leaders, Dr Riyad Hijib, the co ordinator of the Syrian High Negotiating Committee (HNC), called for “targeted unilateral sanctions against Russian and Iranian entities and individuals directly enabling war crimes in Syria through the supply of material assistance”. The HNC also called for an urgent review of economic ties with Iran , including commercial airlines used by Iran to send weapons and fighters to Syria. Many EU states will be deeply reluctant to re impose sanctions on Iran so soon after lifting them as part of the wider deal on Iran’s nuclear programme. But the renewed emphasis on Iran reflects the key role played by Iranian artillery in the capture of east Aleppo. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Voices from Aleppo: the situation is apocalyptic – video report Shia militias have also played a decisive role. Raised by Iran’s Revolutionary Guards, the militias have been far more effective than Syrian units. Their numbers had built around east Aleppo since early last year to an estimated force of 6,000-8,000 troops, many of them battle-hardened in Iraq or southern Lebanon. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Major General Qassem Suleimani, the leader of the Iranian-backed militias fighting in Syria. Photograph: HO/AFP/Getty Images The militias report to the Iranian Maj Gen Qassem Suleimani, who was tasked more than a decade ago by the supreme leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, to export the values of the Islamic Revolution into the Arab world. Suleimani’s Quds Force is one of the Guards’ most elite units, attracting ideological cadres who believe in Shia supremacy. Under Suleimani’s control are several Iraqi units, Asa’ib ahl al-Haq, Abu al-Fadhil al-Abbas, and the Nujaba Front, which is affiliated with the Keta’ib Hezbollah militia. All are power players in Iraq’s political-military sphere. Lebanese Hezbollah plays the same role in Beirut and southern Lebanon, where it is interwoven into the political and security apparatus. The battle for eastern Aleppo in maps: how rebel territory is shrinking Read more Hezbollah was the first of the Iranian proxies to join the fight alongside Assad, and has paid a heavy price for doing so. Party loyalists in Beirut say at least 1,600 of its fighters had been killed in Syria before the conquest of east Aleppo. Shia graveyards in Najaf have similarly been filling up, with several thousand Iraqi fighters known to have been killed in Syria and buried in large dedicated plots bought by the militias over the past three years. Most casualties from the Iranian side have been Afghan refugees, recruited on the promise that their families would gain the right to reside in Iran. But an Iranian official said recently that as many as 1,000 Iranians had died in Syria since the conflict began. The blood and treasure expended by Iran has focused on Aleppo and the western suburbs of Damascus, the site of the Zainab shrine – a pilgrimage point for Shia Muslims. Iran has framed its war effort in sectarian terms, insisting the men it has sent to fight are in Syria to defend the shrine from Sunni extremists. In addresses inside Syria, Akram al-Ka’abi, the leader of the Nujaba Front, has exhorted his followers to seek revenge for battlefield losses to Sunni figures in the founding years of Islam. On Tuesday, President Hassan Rouhani, meeting with the prominent Iraqi cleric Ammar al-Hakim, in Tehran, said his government would spare no efforts in supporting “the oppressed nations of the region, including Iraq and Syria”. In a departure from his hitherto cautious stance on Syria, Rouhani telephoned Assad on Wednesday to “congratulate” him on the “liberation of Aleppo”, Fars news reported. “We see it as our duty to support those trying to force takfiri terrorism out of their territory,” he told his Syrian counterpart. • This article was amended on 15 December 2016.

{ "title":"A Christmas Carol (the modern-day economics edition)", "content": "It is December 1843 in London. Queen Victoria has been on the throne for six years, Sir Robert Peel is prime minister, and Charles Dickens is about to publish a seasonal novella. A Christmas Carol is the story of how the embittered miser Ebenezer Scrooge becomes generous and cuddly following visits from the ghosts of Christmas past, present and future. It is December 2015. Queen Elizabeth II has just become Britain’s longest reigning monarch. David Cameron, who views himself as a modern-day Peel, is prime minister. And a latter-day Dickens is about to publish a remake of the 19th-century classic. So here it is: an economics Christmas Carol. The story begins with a journey a century into the past. In many ways life could not have been grimmer in December 1915. The Great European powers have been at war for 16 months. Britain and her allies have suffered heavy losses at Gallipoli; armies face each other across the barbed wire on the western front. The Guardian view on Britain’s jobs market: Osborne could use Scrooge’s caution | Editorial Read more But it is not all bad news. A second industrial revolution is in full swing, bringing with it a new wave of inventions that will transform the way people live their lives. Some of these – the telephone, the motor car, the aeroplane, electric light, cinema – are already available. Others, such as wireless, TV and antibiotics, remain in the future. The economic change spawns a cultural revolution. Modernism is all the rage, from Stravinsky and Picasso to Joyce and Le Corbusier. Now turn the clock forward by 20 years. It is 1935, another unhappy period. It is the decade of the Great Depression and totalitarianism. The Nuremberg race laws have been passed; Stalin’s purges are in full swing. But look closely enough and, once again, there is a silver lining to the cloud. The worst of the slump is over and unemployment is coming down. In the US, laws are being passed to prevent Wall Street from capsizing the economy. In Britain, Keynes is putting the finishing touches to the General Theory, a book that will revolutionise economics. Old industries such as coal are in decline. Newer industries such as car manufacturing are on the rise. It’s now December 1975 and pessimism abounds. The long postwar boom has come to a sudden halt following a fivefold increase in oil prices. Keynesian economics seems incapable of finding a solution to stagflation: a combination of high inflation and rising unemployment. In Britain, the annual increase in the cost of living has reached a peacetime peak of 26%, and before another year is out the Labour government will be forced to obtain a loan from the International Monetary Fund that comes with painful strings attached. On the other hand, the internet revolution has begun, the first mobile telephone call has been made two years earlier, and any year that includes the first showing of Fawlty Towers can’t be all bad. So, that’s Christmases past. The first thing to say about Christmas present is that it could have been worse. At one point in 2015, the euro was having an existential crisis, there appeared a real possibility that the world would slide into deflation, and that regional conflicts in the Ukraine and the Middle East might spread. There have been four big themes to the global economy in 2015. The first is the uncertainty about what has been happening in China, where growth has clearly slowed but nobody is quite sure by how much. Officially, everything is going according to a plan that will allow growth to be more sustainable, but the official figures are, with good reason, taken with a large dollop of salt. Some analysts, those at the consultancy Fathom, for example, believe China is already suffering a hard economic landing. The second big theme, linked to the first, has been collapsing commodity prices. If 1975 was a year when Opec showed its muscle, 2015 has been the year when the oil cartel demonstrated its impotence. At a time when Iranian oil has started to flow back into global energy markets, Saudi Arabia has decided to drive the oil price lower by pumping more crude in the vain belief this will kill off the US shale industry. This is a classic example of a country shooting itself in the foot; the Saudis need an oil price of $100 a barrel to balance the books. The price is currently around a third of that level. The third theme has been Greece and the euro. From the moment Alexis Tsipras became prime minister at the head of his Syriza coalition in January, Athens was on a collision course with its single-currency partners. Tsipras had three mutually incompatible objectives: to soften the terms of Greece’s austerity programme; to return the country to growth; and to remain in the euro. At one point in the summer, it looked as if this trilemma might be resolved by Greece leaving (or being pushed out of) the single currency. Eventually, and in time-honoured fashion, Europe came to a compromise: Greece got a third bailout by agreeing to more draconian terms than those in force before Syriza came to power. The half-finished nature of the global recovery has been the fourth big theme of 2015. In the developed world, Britain and the US appear to have made more progress than the eurozone and Japan, but life has not really returned to normal even in the Anglo-Saxon economies. To be sure, growth looks reasonably solid and unemployment is down to pre-crisis levels, but only because interest rates have remained at ultra-low levels. Inflation is low and workers have had to get used to nugatory wage increases. The year has ended with the Federal Reserve raising interest rates in the US for the first time in almost decade, a small increase in the cost of borrowing that could have big ramifications in some of the more vulnerable emerging market economies. Brazil, in particular, is in serious trouble. The optimistic way of looking at 2015 is to see it as the pivot between the long hangover that followed the Great Recession and a new era of strong growth marked by stricter control of financial markets, a new wave of inventions, and the move towards a cleaner, greener economy following the deal on climate change reached in Paris earlier this month. The pessimistic way of looking at 2015 is to see it as a brief interlude between one crisis and the next, marked by the steady descent into deflation, populism and protectionism. Seen from this perspective, the underlying problems of the global economy – inequality, debt and financial market excess – have not gone away. The ghost of Christmas future knows what happens next. But as all Dickens fans know, his works were often published as serials to keep the reader guessing. Come back next week to find out what 2016 will bring.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Most Tory MPs leaning towards Brexit, says party’s leave group chair", "content": "Most Conservative MPs are leaning towards voting for the UK to leave the EU as the mood of the party has hardened against David Cameron’s attempted renegotiation in the last three weeks, according to the chair of the Tory leave group. Steve Baker, who is co-chairman of Conservatives for Britain, said he thought the majority of the parliamentary party was leaning towards joining the leave campaign and that inclination was evident among both backbenchers and the ministerial ranks. Baker, whose group is allied to the cross-party Vote Leave campaign, said “over half of the Conservative party is strongly leaning to leave”. In light of the clear split, he warned there would be “problems ahead” if Cameron did not allow free campaigning on both sides of the debate. “I think for the sake of the country, party and quality of debate it would be much better if ministers have freedom to speak their mind on the EU issue,” he said. His warning was echoed by two other senior Tories – Liam Fox, the former defence secretary, and Graham Brady, the chairman of the backbench 1922 committee, who said it would be a “catastrophic mistake” for Cameron to force all ministers to campaign for staying in the EU. Brexit – what would happen if Britain left the EU? Read more Fox became the first senior Conservative to confirm he will definitely push for a British exit on Sunday, in a move that could pave the way for other Tories to break rank before Cameron has finished his Brussels discussions. Fox, a longtime Eurosceptic and former defence secretary, said it was clear that the prime minister would not be able to negotiate enough fundamental reforms to the UK’s relationship with the EU to satisfy him. Writing in the Sunday Times, he said Cameron was going around Europe with a “political begging bowl”. The MP said Cameron should end his “pretence” of renegotiation and Britain should no longer be “tied to an economically failing, socially tense and politically unstable project”. While the Eurosceptics believe they have momentum, they are likely to be furious at reports that Downing Street is planning to send pamphlets making the case for the benefits of the UK staying in the EU before the “purdah” period begins when Whitehall cannot get involved in referendum issues. No cabinet minister has been able to publicly declare they back Britain leaving the EU because of collective responsibility, but Eurosceptic sources believe Theresa Villiers, Chris Grayling and Iain Duncan Smith would be likely to resign rather than campaign to remain. Other cabinet ministers who could go either way include John Whittingdale, Sajid Javid, Michael Gove and Theresa May. There were reportst that Duncan Smith and May are opposing a compromise with Brussels that would involve stopping all citizens claiming benefits unless they could prove four years of residency because it could hit up to 300,000 Britons. Baker said: “The party is about evenly leaning each way. Looking back carefully at my canvassing, I think there might be about 130 MPs in total who might lean in favour of voting to remain. That is a minority in the Conservative party and I think that is throughout government as well.” Baker said he had found evidence of “hardening of opinion” against staying in the EU among his colleagues in the past three weeks, as they felt Cameron’s renegotiations would not deliver fundamental reform of the UK’s relationship with Brussels. The MP for Wycombe said he had “very good reason to believe more colleagues will be declaring their support for Vote Leave in the weeks after new year” – before the prime minister has finished his negotiations with Brussels. Others will need to have discussions with their associations. In a sign that Downing Street could be intending to insist that ministers toe the line, Sir John Major, who is still close to No 10, said people deserved to hear a clear-cut argument from Cameron and his cabinet. The former prime minister said it would be “extraordinary” if any cabinet minister said they would campaign for the UK to leave the EU before discussions were over. Major said he “would very much hope they would not wish” to vote to leave. “The unity of the argument, the argument for the sake of the country, is very important,” he told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show. He added that he believed the EU would ultimately compromise on a deal because it needs the fastest-growing economy in the bloc to stay. Major also said the UK would have to face the consequences of leaving the EU, as there would be no going back. “If we vote to stay out then we are out and we will have to get on with it and face the consequences, which will be many and varied. Of course we will survive – we are a big and a powerful nation – of course we will. That’s not the point. The point is would we be as safe? No. Would we be as well off? No. Would we be as influential? No. So that is the point that is really at issue.” Europe, in or out? The key questions facing David Cameron and Britain Read more Cameron has claimed he made progress with European leaders in a discussion about his renegotiation demands at a Brussels summit last week. Eurosceptics now believe the referendum will probably be held in the summer of next year. Before then, the prime minister wants concessions from Brussels on his demands for greater veto powers for national parliaments, protections for non-eurozone countries, an end to “ever closer union” and curbs for migrant benefits – but the last of these has met with significant opposition from other EU leaders. The polls suggest the vote could be close, with public opinion showing as increasingly Eurosceptic. An ICM poll for the Vote Leave campaign found 50% of voters were in favour of leaving, if those who said they were undecided were excluded. Overall, 41% wanted to leave while 42% wanted to stay, and the rest did not know. The poll, published in the Daily Telegraph, found the numbers were different if Cameron won no concessions on freedom of movement and curbing migration. In that case, 45% would vote for a Brexit and 40% would back staying in the EU – or 53% to leave and 47% to remain, excluding undecideds. A separate poll by Survation in the Express found 42% would vote to leave compared with 40% who would vote to stay.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Nearly 80 still missing in Indonesian ferry accident", "content": "Nearly 80 people are still missing nearly 24 hours after a ferry ran into trouble in rough seas off Indonesia, with authorities not ruling out the possibility of a sinking. Doubts raised about whether Australia told UN of decision to ban refugees Read more The transport ministry has confirmed that three people, including two children, have been found dead, while 39 others have been pulled from the water alive, some after desperately clinging to fishing buoys for hours in the huge swell until help arrived. Search and rescue teams have still not found the stricken vessel, the Marina Baru, which was ferrying 118 people around Sulawesi island when it sent out a distress signal late on Saturday afternoon, according to police. The whereabouts of the remaining 76 people is unclear, with search and rescue teams being hampered by rough conditions and waves up to five metres (16 feet) high as daylight dwindled. When asked whether the boat had sunk, police spokesman Frans Barung said: “Maybe yes, maybe no. “The boat has not been found because the weather has not been good,” he added, saying the boat was made of fibreglass and was therefore difficult to sink. Coastguards lost contact with the ferry late on Saturday afternoon and it failed to arrive at its destination in Siwa across the Bay of Bone as scheduled. Officials dismissed initial reports the boat had sunk, instead claiming it was adrift, having lost engine power. Police, national search and rescue teams and the navy have been scouring the water for survivors since but have been battling the weather. Roki Asikin, the head of the local search and rescue force, said powerful waves meant it took three hours to get some survivors to shore. “These waves were very high,” he said. There had been warnings about extreme weather in the days leading up to the accident, with strong winds and rough seas. The Indonesian archipelago of more than 17,000 islands is heavily dependent on ferry services but the industry has a poor safety record and fatal accidents are common. This week a Danish cargo ship collided with a tanker and sank off western Indonesia, with some crew still missing.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Beijing highway: $600m road just the start of China's investments in Caribbean", "content": "Stretching some 67 km (41.6 miles) north to south across Jamaica, the $600m four-lane highway skirts around a mountain and will eventually be lined with luxury hotels, restaurants and bars. Nicknamed the “Beijing highway” – after the Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt reportedly turned down a chance for the road to carry his name – the state-of-the-art tolled carriageway is the most striking sign that the Chinese treasure ship has arrived in the Caribbean. The red and gold flag of the People’s Republic flutters over the construction site, where hundreds of Chinese workers reside in camps and trucks are lined up in military precision. When completed early next year the tolled highway, paid for by Beijing, will cut driving times from Kingston to the tourist resort of Ocho Rios on the north coast from nearly two hours to 50 minutes. Beijing highway Jamaica China The ‘Beijing highway’ It is the single biggest investment by the Chinese in the Caribbean. In return for expertise and investment, the Jamaican government has handed over 1,200 acres of land around the road to the Chinese, who plan to build three luxury hotels with 2,400 rooms. In a country in the grip of austerity imposed by the International Monetary Fund, and where poverty has doubled since 2007, according to the Centre for Economic Policy Research, the arrival of the Chinese is seen by many as the only hope. Jamaica has become the hub of the Chinese presence in the Caribbean, and is now home to the regional offices of the state owned Chinese Harbour Engineering Company, (CHEC) which is building the highway link road. The country’s prime minister Portia Simpson has rejected warnings from trades unionists that the presence of the Chinese will do little to lift Jamaicans out of unemployment, but the government has not said how many local people will be employed on the project. The Joint Industrial council – a coalition of building and construction workers – has said the Government’s claim that Chinese workers are only brought in to do advanced engineering work is “egregious and misleading” and the Chinese are doing common labourer’s work which could be done by Jamaicans. Simpson condemns criticism saying discussion of the issue will send the message “do not invest in Jamaica” to the Chinese. There are also concerns over the route. Simon Mitchell, professor of geology at the University of the West Indies said the lack of transparency around the investment and the building project was worrying. “There is a big issue with the middle section of the road and what is going to happen when there’s an earthquake? That part of the road crosses two faults, there are gigantic soil deposits sitting on top of them and then the road is on top of all that. There is real concern as to how stable it is. The government showed me the plans that the Chinese company used and I am still not convinced that the solution is safe.” The “Beijing” highway is currently the largest single investment by the Chinese in the Caribbean – but not for much longer. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Chinese ambassador to Jamaica Dong Xiaojun shows Portia Simpson around the North/South Highway construction site in Linstead, Jamaica, on 20 May 2014. Photograph: Alamy During a visit to Beijing with her ministers earlier this year, the prime minister announced a project which will dwarf the road in both size and cost. It involves the Chinese building a $1.5bn deep water container port on islands in Jamaica using dredging and land reclamation to accommodate mega ships coming through the expanded Panama Canal. But the islands – Goat Island and Little Goat Island – are internationally protected ecological sites, home to threatened species of birds, fish and reptiles. Diana McCaulay of the Jamaica Environment Trust said the plan would involve the destruction of Goat Island, including wetlands, coral reefs and the largest remaining area of intact dry limestone forest in Jamaica. It was being pursued, she said, with no discussion or transparency. “The details of the port project have never been released, no plans have been put forward publicly we have had to use the access to information laws to get what details we have,” she said. “Our concern is that this is an environmentally protected area, its environmental importance was protected by law internationally and by the Government of Jamaica, so to turn around and announce while in Beijing that this port was being planned, before any discussions were held with anyone in the region, makes a mockery of their environmental protection. They are just selling off our islands not even perhaps to the highest bidder.” The Chinese Harbour Engineering Company (CHEC) did not respond to requests for a comment.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Danish MEP quits ruling party over plan to seize refugees' valuables", "content": "An MEP from Denmark’s centre-right ruling party has defected in protest at government plans to seize valuables from refugees to help fund their stay in the country. Denmark has mainly been a transit country for refugees, and the minority Liberal government hopes to deter more from seeking asylum by taking valuables or cash worth more than 3,000 Danish crowns (£290) during border searches. Jens Rohde said the proposal, and other laws cutting benefits for refugees, showed the Liberals had lost their way and were pandering to the anti-immigrant Danish People’s party (DF), on whose support it depends in parliament. “The Liberal party has lost out big time to the DF. The DF’s opinions are absolutely legitimate but I don’t understand why we have to copy them,” Rohde told the broadsheet newspaper Politiken. He said he was joining the leftwing Social-Liberal party. “I’m wondering and I’m concerned that there’s no major outrage among Danes, that there aren’t more people standing up and saying this can’t be right. It cannot be right that we have to accept that they take the last bits of jewellery and the last dignity from refugees when they arrive to Denmark,” he added. The immigration reform bill, which has yet to be approved by parliament, would give authorities “the power to search the clothing and luggage of asylum-seekers and other migrants without a permit to stay in Denmark with a view to finding assets which may cover expenses,” the immigration ministry said. Denmark expects 20,000 asylum seekers this year, compared with almost 200,000 expected by Sweden. Many of the refugees passing through Denmark this year have been bound for its neighbour. The Liberals, who hold 39 of parliament’s 179 seats, have been walking a policy tightrope between keeping DF on their side while eliciting the support of the centre-left opposition Social Democrats for the government’s more EU-friendly policies.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Labour not responsible for crash, says former Bank of England governor", "content": "The former Bank of England governor Mervyn King has denied that the previous Labour government was responsible for the financial crash, saying there was a shared intellectual responsibility across the political parties and financial institutions for failing to foresee the problems. Saying his view on the cause of the crisis had evolved, he said he doubted any single one country could have found their way through the crisis. His remarks on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, which he was guest-editing, will please the shadow chancellor, Ed Balls, as he prepares to battle a Conservative claim at the next election that Labour mismanagement of City regulation and excessive public spending were jointly responsible for the crash from which the UK economy is still recovering. In the past King has hinted at select committee sessions that Labour allowed public spending to rise too fast but his latest remarks are one of his clearest exonerations of Labour for the financial crash. Asked how culpable Labour was, he replied: “I am not going to talk about individual parties’ culpability because I think the real problem was a shared intellectual view right across the entire political spectrum and shared across the financial markets that things were going pretty well. “There were imbalances – we knew things were unsustainable – but it was not entirely obvious where it would come unstuck – and I think that is something everyone shared, and the right thing is to make it better for the future.” He added: “I don’t think it is easy to go back and say any one country on its own around the world could have found their way through it. We did talk in the Bank of England about whether we should have had much higher interest rates before the crisis. “If we had done that we undoubtedly would have had a downturn, probably a recession even, unemployment and inflation well below the target. But we as one country could not have stopped the financial crisis occurring so I think we should have been shooting ourselves in the foot; even if you could argue that if every country had done that it may be we would not have been in such a difficult position.” He said he did not think the cause of the crisis lay in the regulation itself but “a complete change in psychology and fear in the financial markets about the credit-worthiness of banks”. “Looking back the leverage of banks was absurdly high and should have been lower. I don’t think there is any point blaming them for it. It came as an enormous surprise to everyone that banks were not creditworthy.” However, he said he was not sure that policymakers had “yet got to the heart of what went wrong”, and said he was not yet sure the banking system was safe enough.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Lancashire primary pupils get spending lesson in move to tackle debt problem", "content": "A modern-day Christmas tale is being narrated to children at St George’s primary school in Chorley, Lancashire. “I lost track of how much I was spending,” says the mother in the story. “I just wanted to make Christmas special.” The tale, incorporating debts, bailiffs and school bullies, is part of a lesson being taught by teenage “Money Mentors” from nearby Southlands high school. The older children take the class of year-five pupils through exercises on “wants and needs” as well as the story of a family’s Christmas debt hangover, as seen through the eyes of a child. Although financial education became compulsory in English secondary schools in September it is not yet on the national curriculum for primary schools. But sessions for younger children like the one at St George’s are in high demand as schools seek to tackle a rise in the number of families struggling with crippling debts through borrowing from payday and doorstep lenders. “It’s getting a conversation going about money and we are traditionally very stoic about that in Britain,” says Dave Goulden, a teacher at Southlands school who helps the older children put the lessons together. “If you can get kids talking about it in primary schools, that helps and it gets back to parents as well.” In the class being taught by his students, their young pupils are busy separating wants from needs. They are pretty sure toys and chocolate fall in the first category while water and shelter are in the second. But friends, school trips and computers appear to be a grey area. “You need a computer for work if you are a teacher or something,” says Josh, aged nine. “But computers won’t save your life,” says Aidan. Their teacher, Andy Smith, says designing the programme so older students teach the main lessons is helping get pupils interested. “It gets rid of that ‘uncool’ tag,” he says. His 35 pupils are among 4,000 primary children in the region learning about budgets, savings and debts in lessons designed and taught by secondary school students. The scheme was created by the Debt Advice Foundation , the charity that runs a national helpline, on the principle that prevention is better than cure. After the successful pilot scheme, the charity hopes to roll out the programme across the country. It sees demand continuing to rise, not least because research has suggested secondary school age is too late to change attitudes to money. The charity’s chairman, Dennis Benson, says the money management course was born out of the experiences of people on the helpline. “We were obsessed with the thought that debt was becoming a major social problem and we could see no escape from that. We still can’t, frankly, because although we are talking about an economic recovery and the creation of jobs, the number of people in jobs with debts is very high,” says Benson, former chairman of a Lancashire NHS foundation trust. The charity’s main educational aim is to help form children’s attitudes, although Benson hopes pupils will take their books home to show parents. “Our view was that realistically we are not going to be able to re-educate older people but if you can teach the young people about good debt and bad debt we can start something, get a forest fire going,” he says. When the English curriculum changed in September it marked a breakthrough for charities that had long campaigned for financial education. But the government must not stop there, they say. The Personal Finance Education Group (Pfeg) wants the subject extended to all primary schools, including academies and free schools which are not bound by the national curriculum. When the charity surveyed teachers, more than 80% said financial education must begin in primary school. Debt Advice Foundation’s education manager, Brian Souter, foresees personal finance lessons eventually becoming statutory in primary schools. “Schools, through no fault of their own, have become entrenched in exams and the life skills have suffered,” says Souter, who spearheaded the charity’s money management project while still in his previous role as deputy headteacher at Southlands school. “If we don’t do this, we are abdicating our responsibilities as adults here.” The worries about household debts are widely shared. Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts for the government suggest that over the next five years households will become even more indebted than they were on the eve of the financial crisis, with their gross debt rising to more than 180% of incomes from around 170% in 2008. Schools that Souter works with report growing concerns about families struggling with exorbitant charges on their short-term borrowing from payday lenders. The lenders often have annual interest rates in excess of 5,000% and costs mount quickly if the borrowing period is extended or a repayment is missed. In a bid to promote more affordable loans, some schools on the money management programme are working with credit unions. Every pupil at All Saints Church of England primary in Chorley has a savings account with a credit union. “It’s hearing about these doorstep lenders and we had parents coming into us upset and struggling,” says headteacher Sarah Partington. “We need people to know how to borrow from somewhere sensible.” Down the road at Coppull primary the local credit union set up a stand at a recent parents’ evening. The school was running the financial education scheme. “We were hoping these lessons were filtering home and this is the next step to getting to the parents,” says the headteacher, Michael Chambers. “We have seen very much that money was becoming an issue for our families, for example, in terms of referrals to food banks.” The Debt Advice Foundation knows such problems are common and it is talking to potential partner schools in other regions about introducing its student-taught lessons. The charity wants government help with promotion but is wary of involvement from Whitehall, for fear a grassroots initiative would become too bureaucratic. “If they said we would like you to be part of this department or the other, then Lord help us,” says Benson. He saw first-hand the damage done by problem debts when he worked in the NHS and is determined to change attitudes. “I have almost been scarred by the experiences I have had of talking to people who are suffering from the consequences of debt,” says the 82-year-old. “I can think of many more enjoyable things to do with my dotage. But it just feels important.”",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Security fears and money worries take toll on Afghan literary scene", "content": "Every Thursday, down a quiet residential street, hundreds of men gather inside a red tent. Here, they turn off their mobile phones and settle down for an afternoon of poetry reading. In Afghanistan, which has a literacy rate of 28%, poetry and the oral tradition of it has long been part of the culture. Even an illiterate farmer will have a few lines of Rumi, the nation’s preferred scribe, committed to memory. The medium has served as a glue that binds together the ethnicities that make up the modern state of Afghanistan. The Thursday gatherings were started by Gulnoor Bahman and 10 friends 11 years ago, and now have more than 1,000 members. At half a dozen branches across Afghanistan, enthusiasts get together to recite poems written in the country’s two official languages, Dari and Pashto, as well as lesser known tongues such as Pashayi and Balochi. But in recent years, the party has got smaller. With the withdrawal of foreign troops, security and economic concerns have been mounting. Leisure activities, such as poetry readings, have been the first to go in families on tight budgets. Many are foregoing the literary communion in favour of staying at home. Mir Ziahuddin’s day job is as a translator at a hospital north of Kabul. “In Afghanistan, no one helps the poets, so we all have day jobs,” he explained., his gap-toothed smile creating creases along his eyes. “Poetry is a money losing venture,” chimed in Halahuddin Bahri, whose day job is advising the finance ministry. Next spring, the foreign-funded hospital where Ziahuddin works will close its doors, and he is unsure what will happen to him, let alone if he will be able to keep up his Thursday tradition. But for now, he continues to make the arduous commute of two, sometimes even three, hours to attend.“When I was a young boy, I fell in love with poetry,” Ziahuddin said. “And since then, whenever I feel that something is wrong with my country, I write it down.” “ These days,” he added, “ those feelings are mostly sadness.” His boyhood friends have all moved away, mostly to Iran, Pakistan, the US and the UK. The advent of social media has helped them reconnect, and they share their latest poems on Facebook. Ziahuddin has written about love and family, but his recent poems have also covered subjects as varied as the last presidential election, the raging insurgency, and a gang rape scandal that rattled the country. In between drags on his Marlboro cigarettes, Bahman said five of his children and his wife were living abroad. Asked why, he responded: “To ask why anyone leaves Afghanistan is to ask why anyone would run out of a burning building.” To mourn their departure, Bahman has written a short poem: “You are going I am going You from this city I from this world” Bahman understands that it would be better for him to leave Afghanistan. The country’s fledgling intellectual class did well under the Nato intervention — the country’s arts flourished with the blessing of western donors and their funding. But with the withdrawal of western troops, the sense of immunity that the country’s poets and musicians and other artists have enjoyed is rapidly ebbing away. In a brazen attack earlier this month, a teenage suicide bomber detonated himself during a performance at a French-funded theatre in downtown Kabul. In a statement issued the next day, the Taliban said it would treat “cultural invasions” the same as military invasions. It went on to condemn members of the civil society and media, accusing them of misleading the youth away from Islam. They appeared to have men like Bahman in mind. But Bahman remains defiant. “A thousand times they have asked me to join them,” he said, referring to his family abroad, “but my work is here.” Mujib Mehrdad is another poet whose subjects have evolved to reflect the changing tides of society. His latest collection, named Soldiers, is “about human beings caught in a difficult situation, namely, war.” One is about a Taliban fighter. “He is in a training camp, and there, he thinks himself closer to God. God’s breath touches his hair. He believes all other living beings to be living in sin.” “Later,” Mehrdad continued, “he is sent out on a suicide mission. On his last day on earth, he sees the petals of a flower quivering in the wind. The beauty of those petals stops him in his tracks, but only for a while. His intentions are too powerful – nothing can prevent him.” “Nobody wins in a war,” Mehrdad added. “We are all victims when we are on the battlefield.”",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"The future has begun, says leftist Alexis Tsipras as he scents power in Greece", "content": "Within minutes of the Athens parliament failing to elect a president, Alexis Tsipras, the man most likely to become Greece’s next prime minister, said the country had experienced “a historic day”. For the first time since the foundation of the modern Greek state nearly 200 years ago, radical leftists – marginalised, tortured and tormented for the best part of the 20th century – were on course to assume power. “Greeks,” he said, “should rejoice.” The government that had put the country through an assault course of austerity would soon be over. The onerous terms of the deeply unpopular “memoranda”, agreed with foreign lenders to keep insolvent Greece afloat, would be overturned. “The future has already begun,” he told reporters as the nation braced for early elections, a constitutional diktat when presidential polls fail. “You should be optimistic and happy.” But the prospect of renewed political turmoil in the country where the eurozone crisis began will bring anything but a smile to the faces of decision makers in Brussels and Berlin. Greece, ineluctably, is being drawn into a new dance of uncertainty, a rollercoaster ride of high-pressure politics. After six years of recession, the nation is only now beginning to show the first signs of recovery, posting a primary surplus – before interest payments on its mountain of debt – and returning to the capital markets that cut off funding at the start of the crisis. But the country cannot survive alone. And market reaction to Monday’s news was instantly pessimistic, with the Athens Stock exchange plummeting by more than 10 percent.With bailout funds guaranteed to the end of February but far from assured after that, the spectre of Greece defaulting on its loans, and possibly crashing out of the eurozone, have been revived. Athens faces debt repayments of up to €20bn (£15.6bn) in 2015. On Monday the Greek finance minister, Gikas Hardouvelis, said local banks had enough funds to survive until March but unless further financial assistance was agreed they would enter into the uncharted waters of non-liquidity after that. This makes an effectively rudderless Athens in the run-up to elections on 25 January more daunting for the “troika” of creditors at the EU, ECB and IMF. “What we are looking at is a Greece in crisis,” said Dimitris Keridis, professor of political science at Panteion University. “The first party will be Syriza but the elections may well be inconclusive. And then, once a government is formed, it will have a few weeks to elect a new president and negotiate with the troika.” The radical leftists wasted no time, announcing that Tsipras would hold his first pre-election speech in central Athens on Monday night. The result of the presidential poll indicated the thirst, at least on a political level, for new beginnings. Opinion polls at the weekend confirmed Syriza’s popularity among a population exhausted by austerity. An Alco poll published in Proto Thema on Sunday showed the neo-Marxists leading by 3.3%. Many supporters are neither leftist, nor admirers of Syriza’s anti-capitalist rhetoric, but Greeks appalled by the catastrophic effects of policies that have left 1.5 million unemployed, 3 million facing poverty and the vast majority unable to pay their bills. The party has pledged to fight such ills – referred to as Greece’s silent humanitarian crisis – by renegotiating the bailout accords that have propped up the economy to the tune of €240bn. “Solution to Greece’s problems lies within the European context but the first thing we will say is that the programme has failed because it was badly planned and didn’t see the pitfalls that were coming,” said Euclid Tsakalotos, Syriza’s shadow finance minister. “Then we will address the priorities of austerity and debt.” The economist, the scion of a prominent Greek family who was raised in Britain and educated at Oxford University, denies the charge of populism that has been levelled at the leftists. Outlining his economic policy, Tsipras, who turned 40 this year, promised instant debt relief, food relief and provision of homes and electricity for Greeks hardest hit by belt-tightening. “The accusation is not right,” said Tsakalotos. “We are not promising everything to everyone. The [relief] measures will not affect anyone earning above €1,000 a month.” Patronage politics and vested interests had made it impossible for Greek governments, including prime minister Antonis Samaras’s fragile, two-party alliance, to step back and reform. “We are a new lot who can clean the slate and start again,” he told the Guardian. “All too often the troika has demanded irrelevant reforms at the expense of dealing with the important issues of corruption and tax evasion.” Political analysts downplay the dangers posed by Syriza. As it has edged ever closer to power, the party has launched a concerted campaign to reassure and placate creditors of its policies and intent. Tsipras has repeatedly said that the leftists are committed to Greece remaining in the euro currency bloc. But few deny that if it does come to power, Athens appears headed towards a major collision with its partners. “There is potential for an accident because the new government will have to resume negotiations with the troika and complete them by the end of February,” said Pavlos Tzimas, a leading political commentator. “All the signs are that some sort of Syriza government will be handed the hot potato.” In a hint of the looming clash, the German finance minister Wolfgang Schäuble said that, in the event of elections, whoever assumed power would have to respect agreements signed by those in office before. “The tough reforms are bearing fruit and there is no alternative to them,” he said.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"The Guardian view of the poll tax papers: judgment on Oliver Letwin", "content": "More than 20 years after it was abolished, Margaret Thatcher’s poll tax remains the locus classicus for domestic political miscalculation and the yardstick by which all other UK governmental policy ineptitudes are still judged. An early book about the whole episode dubbed the poll tax the most celebrated political disaster in postwar Britain. A more recent account of government failures agrees, calling it “the blunder to end all blunders”. It might be thought, in such circumstances, that there is little more that can be added to the prosecution case against the “community charge”. This reckons without the remarkable new details that are revealed today in the Downing Street files for 1985 and 1986 released at the National Archives. These files show that cabinet critics confronted Lady Thatcher and her acolytes with well-costed and fully enumerated warnings about the fiscal and political impact of the poll tax. Seven million people would lose out. Evasion would become endemic. The political consequences would be volcanic. But the papers go on to show that these objections were brushed aside by the policy’s advocates in terms that should make all those concerned blush with shame when they look back on the consequences today. Aside from Lady Thatcher herself, the principal villains of the piece were Lord Rothschild, the former head of the Downing Street thinktank, who came up with the poll tax idea, and Oliver Letwin of the No 10 policy unit, who fought a successful rearguard action against the tax’s cabinet critics and against attempts to water it down. Neither of them possessed political judgment of any kind. Lord Rothschild continued to insist that the poll tax was “a winner”. Meanwhile Mr Letwin successfully urged Lady Thatcher to “use Scotland as a trail-blazer”, a discriminatory approach for which the Conservative party is still paying in Scotland and of which the ultimate price may yet be the dismemberment of the United Kingdom. The heroes of the confrontation are the Tory ministers who are still sometimes dismissed as faint hearts and wets by the Thatcherites. Nigel Lawson told the cabinet that the tax was “completely unworkable and politically catastrophic”, penalising 44% of the electorate. Douglas Hurd said that people would refuse to pay and that the poll tax would bring the system of taxation into disrepute. Both of them were absolutely right, though even they must be surprised that the unravelling continues to this day, under a government that still relies on Mr Letwin’s judgments. A few years before Lady Thatcher and Mr Letwin became obsessed with the poll tax, the American historian Barbara Tuchman wrote a book about the march of folly in human affairs from the Trojan to the Vietnamese war. Ms Tuchman argued that a folly’s success was marked by the determination of its supporters to pursue a foolish and failed policy in the face of clear arguments in favour of an alternative course. The poll tax was Lady Thatcher’s folly. But her supporters and her party have not yet learned the lessons of her act of hubris.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"After the deluge", "content": "There isn’t much left of Dale Dike, which starts life on the moors above Strines and joins the river Loxley at Low Bradfield. Only a couple of kilometres still flow between reservoirs created to quench the thirst of Sheffield’s people and industries. But what there is lies in a glorious, steep-sided valley as though cupped by a hand. Following its course upstream, I bent my head against thick curtains of rain sweeping down from the hills and along the valley. Water surged under Annet Bridge, rusty with peat, lapping at the trunks of alder and willow along the banks. I glimpsed a coal tit shaking raindrops from its feathers. Dale Dike reservoir was full, its overflow channel a frothing brown cascade. This was the site of one of the worst manmade disasters in British history, when the original dam, newly finished, collapsed in 1864 in what became known as the Great Flood at Sheffield. A wall of water scoured the valley downstream, destroying homes and businesses and killing 240 people. Floods once again threaten the Steel City, although the causes are ecological and climate change rather than dam failure. Two people died after heavy rain in 2007, and parts of Sheffield have been flooded twice since. Peak District moors, including those above Dale Dike and Strines, play an important role in slowing the water down. From the western end of the valley, pasture climbs towards the characteristic patchwork of moors that are regularly burned, with public subsidy, to boost the numbers of grouse. Water companies also charge us to clean peat and other impurities from the water. Native trees would make good flood defences, but it’s a controversial notion. Dale Dike reappears above the reservoir but is blocked immediately by another dam at Brogging, a curious name whose meaning escapes me. Local literature usually suggests marshy, but it’s a word familiar to Shakespeare. His father John was a “brogger” – a wool wholesaler – and sheep have a long provenance hereabouts.

{ "title":"UK troops sent to train anti-Isis rebels 'have arrived in Syria'", "content": "The British defence secretary, Sir Michael Fallon, is to announce that UK forces have arrived in the Middle East to help train moderate Syrian rebels engaged in the fight against Islamic State. Fallon is hosting a conference in London of defence ministers from the 67-member US-led coalition against Isis, and the defence secretary is keen to talk up the British contribution. The conference is being held to discuss the next phase of the campaign against Isis as the group is squeezed in its Syrian headquarters in Raqqa and in its Iraqi headquarters in Mosul. Iran hails victory in Aleppo as Shia militias boost Syria's Bashar al-Assad Read more At a similar conference in Paris in October, Fallon announced that the UK would send about 20 trainers to help Syrian moderates with basic infantry skills, frontline medical treatment and identification of hidden explosive devices. His announcement on Thursday confirmed of their arrival. In a statement before today’s meeting the defence secretary said: “Daesh [the government’s name for Isis] is being taken on in eastern Mosul. Last week we opened up a second front around Raqqa. Daesh is losing ground, finance and fighters … In 2017, we must maintain momentum to deal these terrorists a decisive blow.” In spite of the push on Mosul and Raqqa, Isis fighters managed a success this week, temporarily retaking Palmyra in Syria, a development that highlighted how overstretched the forces of the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad, have become. Most of Palmyra has since been reported to have been retaken. The Iraqi army’s push on Mosul has also recently stalled in the face of strong Isis resistance. The UK already has a modest force of 500 infantry in Iraq to help train the Iraqi army. The Ministry of Defence says British troops have trained more than 31,000 Iraqi and Kurdish fighters. The extra 20 trainers have been sent specifically to train Syrian groups, a controversial issue in the past, given the difficulty of distinguishing “moderate” rebels from more extreme groups. Fallon stressed in October that they would be thoroughly vetted to ensure that the UK was not training Islamist factions. The US has special forces on the ground in Syria helping Kurdish troops and Syrian rebels who have surrounded Raqqa. Officially the UK has no troops in Syria, though some are known to have gone at least on reconnaissance trips. US-led airstrikes against Islamic State in Syria and Iraq – interactive Read more The Syrian Democratic Forces, classified by the UK as moderates, said they had started a new phase of an operation to isolate Raqqa with the help of the airstrikes from the US-led coalition, which has carried out 300 raids since November. About 70% of UK airstrikes since June have been in support of the Iraqi army and Kurdish fighters trying to retake Mosul. Fallon will also announce that the UK is to send more intelligence specialists to help sift through the thousands of documents expected to be seized as Mosul and Raqqa fall, in the hope of learning more about the internal structures of Isis, any planned overseas terrorist plots and the identities of financiers. The fall of Manbij in Syria earlier this year provided the US-led coalition with a trove of documents that allegedly pointed to plots in Europe, though not specifically against the UK. The conference in London marks the last visit to the UK by Ash Carter in his capacity of US defence secretary before the Trump administration takes over on 20 January.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Trump to meet tech firms including Apple, Facebook and Google", "content": "One of the most pressing questions Silicon Valley leaders will want answered at their Wednesday meeting with President-elect Donald Trump is whether his administration will clamp down on the immigration policies that technology companies have come to rely on. You only have to look at the executive boards of some of the world’s fastest growing companies to see the contribution immigrants have made. According to a study by the National Foundation for American Policy, immigrants founded more than half (51%) of the current crop of US-based startups valued at more than $1bn. Ctrl+Z: Silicon Valley leaders U-turn on Donald Trump Read more All of this could be under threat if we are to take some of the comments the Trump campaign made in the run-up to the election at face value. The outspoken candidate claimed that Mark Zuckerberg’s push for specialist H1B visas (the main visa used to hire foreign talent to tech companies) was a threat to jobs for American women and minorities. Meanwhile, Trump’s chief strategist Steve Bannon suggested that Asians have too much power in Silicon Valley. About a dozen members of Silicon Valley’s elite – including Apple CEO Tim Cook, Alphabet CEO Larry Page, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg – will meet with Trump in New York. The meeting is likely to provide an opportunity for them to highlight their concerns and priorities with the incoming administration. Trump was critical of Silicon Valley business practices during his campaign – from wanting Apple to stop making phones in China to saying Amazon founder Jeff Bezos bought the Washington Post to exert political power and avoid paying taxes. “If you look at the history of Silicon Valley, it’s clear that drawing on immigrants has been a big part of the vitality, creativity and success of that entrepreneurial melange,” said Marjory Blumenthal, senior policy analyst at Rand Corporation. The incoming administration is leaving some highly skilled tech workers nervous about their immigration status. “I am worried that I might have to go back to India,” said Sandeep Purwar, the founder and CEO of the tech recruiting platform JobAnts. He came into the US on an H1B visa but has since gotten a green card. He’s applying for citizenship as soon as possible to secure his position in the US. A lot of his talk about building a wall and sending back immigrants was to attract Republicans. But he’s a businessman Sandeep Purwar He hopes that Trump’s pro-business stance will outshine his anti-immigration rhetoric. “During his campaign, a lot of his talk about building a wall and sending back immigrants was to attract and energize the rightwing Republican base. But he’s a businessman. He knows the importance of having manpower in this country, so hopefully he’ll be softening on these policies.” Zoltan Istvan, a futurist who ran as an independent presidential candidate, said: “It’s in our very best interest to steal the best engineers from over the world and have them live in America,.” Since the election, the Internet Association, a group of technology companies that includes Facebook, Google, Twitter, Netflix and Amazon, has written to Trump asking him to support a sector that accounts for 6% of the economy by increasing immigration. “The US immigration system must allow more high-skilled graduates and workers to stay in the United States and contribute to our economy,” the association said in an open letter. The letter echoes the demands of Fwd.us, a lobby group set up by tech leaders including Zuckerberg, Bill Gates and Eric Schmidt in 2013 to support immigration reform and expand the H1B visa program, which admits 65,000 workers and another 20,000 graduate student workers each year. While Silicon Valley relies on H1B to bring in skilled foreign workers, the immigration scheme has also been exploited in a way that drives down wages and in some cases displaces American jobs, said Daniel Costa, of the Economic Policy Institute. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Apple CEO Tim Cook will also attend the meeting. Photograph: Marcio Jose Sanchez/AP When tech companies such as Microsoft and Google use H1B as intended – to hire skilled, well-paid foreign workers in short supply – they might also help them get green cards to extend their stays. However, the system is frequently abused, particularly by large contracting firms such as Infosys and Tata Consultancy Services that use the visas to deploy lower-paid contractors that critics say rarely end up with green cards. This exploitation of the system could be fixed by making sure contractors pay H1B workers a fair wage and advertise all jobs to US workers first, Costa explained. But Silicon Valley tech companies have even lobbied against this. Why? “It’s very possible they have shadow workforces staffed with people from outsourcing companies and they don’t want their labor costs to increase,” Costa said. Strong-arm Apple and tax China bigly: a guide to Trump's possible tech policies Read more All of the talk about immigrants taking American jobs ignores another looming challenge: robots or artificial intelligence taking American jobs. “Automation, not immigration, is the bigger issue. AI, software and robots are just starting to destroy the very core economy of America,” Istvan said. “You could try to put legal restrictions on automation but then you can’t create new jobs. It’s a much bigger issue.” According to Sebastian Thrun, the German-born founder of the educational organization Udacity and a former Google employee, automation won’t eliminate jobs, but will create very different ones. Policymakers and workers have no choice but to embrace the change. “If you try to re-create the past we will be left behind,” he said. He argues that automation will free people from the drudgery of repetitive office work and allow them to become inventors. “We’ll enter an age of unparalleled creativity and innovation.” For Trump’s administration, this will mean shifting away from some of the anti-science rhetoric in order to make America a superpower in science and technology. “We are in a scientific Olympic Games with China, so let’s win this,” said Istvan, who has applied to be an adviser to Trump. “I just hope the vice-president [Mike Pence, who isopposed to abortion rights and doesn’t believe in evolution] and other more religious candidates don’t get in the way of things like genetic editing or artificial intelligence, which crosses a few religious lines.”",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Rolls-Royce winning contracts legitimately key to growth, says CEO", "content": "The chief executive of Rolls-Royce, which is under investigation by the Serious Fraud Office over bribery allegations, has said winning business ethically plays a key role in his plans for future growth. Warren East said the Derby-based engineering group was focusing on securing contracts legitimately. “We are spending time training people and making sure everyone understands there is a right way to do business,” he said. “We are keeping training up to date, and steps have been taken to ensure there is a zero tolerance policy to unethical behaviour.” Rolls-Royce, which sells turbines and engines for passenger jets and military aircraft, has been accused of hiring a network of agents to help it land lucrative contracts. East told the Guardian that the FTSE 100 company was committed to winning business by fair means. “I think if we can win with really good products and good service and actually superior products and service, then we are winning sustainably and I am interested in winning sustainably,” he said. A recent Guardian and BBC investigation uncovered leaked documents and testimony from insiders that suggest that Rolls-Royce may have benefited from the use of illicit payments to boost profits for years. When asked whether he was ashamed of the allegations, East said: “It’s not a very desirable situation. But it is what it is, now we have to deal with it and the important thing is, we are dealing with it. I can’t do anything about the past. I can only do things about now and the future.” He refused, however, to comment on the substance of the allegations but said the company was cooperating with the authorities. Speaking at the group’s main Derby site where its flagship Trent XWB jet engine is assembled, he said it was wrong to claim that bribes were a legitimate cost of doing business in some regions and that to do so was “a little bit of an excuse”. The defence sector has been riddled with allegations of corruption because of the secrecy surrounding contracts and their high value. In 2006 Tony Blair’s government halted a SFO investigation into defence firm BAE Systems, saying Britain’s security would be put in danger if it was allowed to continue. But at Rolls-Royce, allegations of corruption were just one of the problems that have dragged the group down. It shares slumped almost 40% in 2015 and this year its first-half pre-tax profit fell 80% to £104m as governments and airlines reined in spending. The airlines switched to smaller, more fuel-efficient, planes which tend not to use Rolls-Royce engines. The engineering group makes the lion’s share of its earnings from maintenance contracts related to its engines and it had not expected airline customers to mothball jets containing its engines earlier than planned. Also its marine business, which services offshore oil rigs, has been heavily affected by the low oil prices. East’s transformation plan has involved stripping away layers of senior management and a raft of positions. More than 5,000 workers have lost their jobs over the past two years. This includes 800 who are set to go in the marine division. When asked if this is now an end to the job cuts, East said the efficiency drive is a never-ending process. “What we have done so far is a stage on the way,. There is no end result per se because we always have to improve as an organisation. It’s a never ending process of maintaining your competitiveness that’s why there is a bit of pace around the changes we have made so far and it will continue that pace through 2017.” But he drew the line at a breakup of the business. ValueAct, the San Francisco-based investor that has built a stake of more than 10% in tRolls-Royce, and recently won a board position as argued that there was more value in splitting it up. East said he disagreed with that view, saying:. “I think my predecessors over multiple generations have worked hard to create the business that we have today and one of the aspects of that is we take our technology and deploy that in multiple sectors. ‘The advantages are in the financial robustness and technology transfer. Their interests [ValueAct’s] and our interests are aligned in terms of improving the competitiveness of the business.” When it comes to manufacturing the economic footprint of Rolls-Royce in the UK is significant. Research by economic forecasting and modelling firm Oxford Economics shows Rolls-Royce supports a total of 135,100 jobs directly and indirectly in the UK – that equivalent of one in every 250 jobs nationwide. Its also contributes more than £12bn to GDP (about 0.7% of the UK economy). Rolls-Royce is vital to Britain’s economic health and while East welcomed government plans to shape a new industrial strategy he said it would only work if policies remain consistent. “The bets we make in the aerospace sector are very chunky, they’re very long term and they transcend multiple governments, so having a strategy which support businesses like us is a good thing,” he said. “Consistency is important for us – what we can’t be doing with is industrial strategies that change every few years.”",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Targets have no place in adoption process", "content": "Louise Tickle is right to highlight the immorality of using targets for adoption (Children should not be adopted to meet municipal targets, 13 December). As the removal of a child from its parents is the gravest of actions, often with traumatic and lifelong consequences, the context demands further interrogation. First, given the complex risk factors that impact upon parenting, including poverty, housing, drug and alcohol problems and abusive relationships, how is it possible to disentangle these and assume they are static and resistant to change? Second, what are the implications for providing families with early help, given the current funding restrictions on support services? Third, what has been the impact of the long-term demonisation of social workers in child abuse cases – is it easier to remove a child than take the risks associated with rehabilitation? How can it be right to have targets for breaking up families? | Louise Tickle Read more The increasing use of targets in children’s services merely gives credibility to both rationing and the stratification of services, adoption being seen as the gold standard, followed by foster care, and then, as a last resort, children’s homes, ignoring key differences in the age at which young people enter care and the challenges they present. Finally, and most disturbing of all, the legitimisation of targets represents a paradigm shift from social workers independently assessing and meeting the needs of some of the most vulnerable children and families in society, to budget managers, easing the way for “outsourcing” and privatisation. Mike Stein Emeritus professor, University of York • Like Louise Tickle, I am determined that all children in care are provided with the best possible environment in which to develop and reach their full potential. On many occasions the most appropriate and successful way of achieving that is by placing them with adoptive parents. However, at Ofsted we have never based our judgment of any local authority children’s services on whether or not they have met their own numerical targets for placing children in adoptive care. Our evaluation of adoption services focuses on the long-term circumstances of all children who are looked after, and the effectiveness of local authorities in ensuring the best option – such as long-term fostering, special guardianship, or return to their birth parents – is secured for each child. What matters most is that children’s individual needs remain at the heart of local authority decision-making. Looked-after children deserve more stability | Letters Read more The most effective local authorities find suitable families as quickly as possible for children whose best interests lie with an adoptive family. We want social workers to be creative, innovative and committed to find a loving, permanent home for the children in their care. Eleanor Schooling Ofsted director for social care • Louise Tickle is right to point out that children these days being adopted could be the future victims of injustice by being “swiftly and forcibly adopted through our family courts” due to quotas being operated by some councils. As a retired children’s guardian, I wonder whether the courts should be requiring each local authority whose plan it is for adoption of a child to state their council’s adoption quota and how this particular child’s adoption will enable them to meet their quota. The judge can then decide with all the available evidence before him/her as to whether this quota could be influencing the plan for this particular child. Sue Cameron Newcastle upon Tyne • Louise Tickle says that the decision to place a child for adoption must be focused solely on what is the right outcome for that child. Vulnerable children have to be protected from abuse, violence or neglect, so what is the alternative to rapid adoption? Fewer than 1% of all children in England are in care but they make up over half (52%) of children in secure training centres and almost two-fifths (38%) of children in young offender institutions. Over two-thirds (68%) of under-18s are reconvicted within a year of release. More adoptions, done faster, provide a far better outcome for children and for society.

{ "title":"The refugee crisis is forcing Germans to ask: who are we?", "content": "I recently read that criminality is on the rise in German towns that have accepted refugees. But it’s not the refugees who are responsible for this crime wave: Germans in these towns have been committing arson, damaging property and attacking refugees. In other words, Germans have been making their own worst fears come true. Often the fear of loss leads to the very loss we fear – a principle that holds true not only for jealous lovers but also, it seems, for those who turn to violence out of fear that the refugees will cost them their safety and peace. The refugees haven’t even all been registered yet, but already they raise questions about who we are. Some Germans can imagine what it means to lose everything – hence their empathy; some can imagine what it means to lose everything – hence their fear. We no longer have a universal frame of reference. Angela Merkel’s declaration that refugees are fundamentally deserving of protection – hers was the only declaration of its kind in Europe – has two main sticking points in her own country. First, there’s the free-market logic according to which the German government will prohibit neither the export of weapons by German companies to warring nations nor the ruthless exploitation of resources under corrupt systems in Africa, Asia and eastern Europe. Germany on course to accept one million refugees in 2015 Read more And then there’s the ever-growing violence, both verbal and physical, from part of the German population: those who would like to see their country walled off with barbed wire – as is happening in Hungary – or, failing that, to at least have the Berlin government refuse to accept even the ridiculously low numbers of refugees mandated by the European Union – as Poland and the UK have done. But which “European values” are best upheld with barbed wire and fences, regulations, harassment and attacks? Liberté, égalité, fraternité? Or is this mainly about our own survival? In eastern Germany, you can once again hear people chanting Wir sind das Volk (“We are the people”). In 1989 that sentence opened a border; now it’s being used to close a border, to insulate this finally unified Volk from the newcomers, who lack any unity since they are fleeing so many different wars. Are other countries’ wars our responsibility? That’s a question you hear a lot these days. But no one wants to hear the answer. Refugees in Germany have been fighting for recognition for nearly 10 years now – people from western and eastern Africa, from Asia and eastern Europe. Syrian refugees have managed to make themselves visible because there are just too many of them to be overlooked. They file across our television screens during news bulletins. They arrive at rail stations in the middle of our cities. They camp in tents and emergency shelters. Heartwarming numbers of individuals have stepped forward to offer help, and there is still moral support from an increasingly isolated Merkel. But the temporary exceptions to the rules of the Dublin III regulation, made to help the refugees from Syria, are already being revoked, and the chancellor herself vowed at her party conference last week to “tangibly reduce the number of refugees arriving”. There are other groups of refugees whose primary occupation for years has been waiting: either legal waiting in asylum-seekers’ housing or illegal waiting in the makeshift shelters maintained by churches and private groups. These refugees go on waiting just as before. Under EU rules (the Dublin regulation again), they are forbidden from seeking employment in any European country other than the one they first set foot in. And that regulation is now being even more strictly enforced than it was in the past. So more and more refugees whose applications for asylum Germany is not legally required to process – or who have not filed applications – are being deported to the countries where they first arrived inside the European Union: in most cases, Italy or Greece. This means they are knowingly being condemned to unemployment, homelessness and starvation, cynically advised by German bureaucrats to “show some initiative”. In practical terms, what is happening is that victims of war whose status as war victims is uncontested often find themselves with no other alternative than to resort to prostitution or criminal activity. And any among them who are found to have returned to Germany in violation of these rules are subject to up to three years’ imprisonment, according to information being circulated by the foreigners registration office in Berlin. Angela Merkel pledges to cut German immigration figures but rejects limit Read more The inability of the German agencies responsible for processing asylum requests to keep up with applications reflects a lack of vision common to all EU countries, each of which has been failing in its own way to help the refugees. There is still no general European position on refugees – no overarching, humane plan. Instead we have short-sighted, nationalistic haggling. Can each problem be “solved” only by creating another one? Why is there no acknowledgment that these people – our fellow human beings – are already here, that all the laws and regulations in the world cannot make them disappear, that they must find places where they can live in peace if they have been fished from the Mediterranean, unloaded from traffickers’ vans, or plucked from the undercarriages of lorries? Sometimes I think about how the people in each of those boats are no different from the rest of us: men, women, and children, among them potential postal workers as well as potential Nobel laureates, plumbers and musicians, office and construction workers, teachers, cabinet-makers, scientists, assembly line workers, sales clerks. Sometimes I am surprised at how little curiosity there is to meet these people and learn what they have experienced – what moves them, what their abilities, ideas and plans are – and how little interest we seem to take in sharing our world with them. If we find it acceptable to let people like this drown, suffocate or freeze to death, we are also accepting the loss of the infinite capacities that dwell in them just as much as in us. By failing to value them, we show disdain for ourselves as well. One person’s deprivation is not another’s gain. Or maybe there are gains to be had, in a limited, economic sense. But nothing real. Sometimes I think we have forgotten that the movement described by these refugees across the Earth’s surface is just a reaction to the movement of those who have been violently carving up the world’s natural resources with no respect for borders, and that a lack of prospects in exploited countries risks giving rise to extremism. We share an inherent survival instinct, and there is a wealth gap in the world that, like all systems based on difference, seeks equilibrium. Given these circumstances, our European indifference to the suffering of so many is becoming the frontline of a battlefield. We are waging war, with indifference as our weapon – indifference to those in flight from violence and war. If we in Europe can’t share 70 years of peace with others, who in this world will? Even 70 years after the end of our war, we know how the fractured biography of an individual inscribes itself in the lives of the second and third generations – as do memories of comfort and help. Perhaps we too will soon be among those who must flee from extremist attacks. Perhaps the fear felt by these refugees will soon be our own. Translated by Susan Bernofsky",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Christmas – surely a prank played on middle-aged women", "content": "When Woman’s Hour attaches the word “labour” to anything, you know it’s only a matter of time before they suggest we should be paid for it. This week Jenni Murray introduced the concept of the emotional labour of Christmas. Behind every card, every orange stuck with cloves, every meal that passes without open hostility, stands an incredibly tired woman, thinking “Seriously? Again? Can’t we do this every two years, like the Venice Biennale?” I balk at this task-based idea of gender, in which each of us is prey to compulsions – tidying, maintaining relationships, creating seasonal smells – that we can’t escape. It’s not necessary to send Christmas cards, nor, come to that, to keep up bonds with people you would never ordinarily contact, except to tug on their sleeve once a year to remind them that you exist. Women don’t so much take on this emotional labour as create it, then complain about it. Indeed, on the labour spectrum – with childbirth at one end, elemental and un-postponable, and Keynes at the other, making work so that work exists – the emotional tasks of Christmas are planted squarely at the hole-digging end. Nobody asked you for a mince pie, love. This to-do list is a monster of your own creation. Except it isn’t. All the minuscule yet bizarrely time-consuming acts of Christmas – which you could, but you never do, refuse – are in fact constructed as respite from the truly arduous work of the season: maintaining harmony between a large number of people who are underoccupied, underlyingly resentful of one another and, if you’ve planned it right, drunk. The World Economic Forum pointed out recently how poorly represented women are in peace processes – between 1922 and 2011 only 4% of negotiators were female. If you think this is systemic sexist exclusion, you’re wrong; we just have our hands tied with peacekeeping in the domestic sphere. We do not have time for public-facing emollience. She gives great Asda advert and never sits down. She is the star turn of the season, she’s bigger than Jesus. I didn’t recognise the true nature of Christmas catering until a Q&A last week with Nigella Lawson, in which a woman with three children under four stood up and said, “I’m hosting 12 people and I refuse to do a turkey. I’m just not doing it. What do you suggest instead?” The answer, for the practically minded among you, is not Doritos; it’s some kind of stew. But the room filled with a palpable, polite scepticism: everybody knows what turkey is about, why stuffing was invented, why processed pork has to be wrapped in cured pork: it’s a carefully constructed escape, a legitimised disengagement. If this lady weren’t doing a turkey, she would have to be resolving a war between three toddlers while processing the real or imagined hostility of adults who may or may not have been thinking they’d have handled it differently. I personally would bone and roll a quail inside a grouse inside a goose for a break from all that – and indeed, have done. If we find it so hard to spend prolonged amounts of time together, why do we put ourselves through it? The best rationale for a winter festival I ever heard was that it gives us a sense of renewal. Our lives are not cyclical; they move in one, immutable direction. So by hitching our festivities to a season, we can make believe that we too revivify and rejuvenate, that life isn’t just an intermittently picturesque crawl toward death. I can’t remember now whether I read that, or Doctor Who said it, but it makes sense of the tenacity of this feast, whose demands are so great, a triathlon of eating, chatting and making delighted faces, often simultaneously. If we accept the intense period of togetherness as necessary, a collective denial of mortality that works only if we all shout it at the same time (with our fingers in our ears), something else falls into place: the necessity of seeming normal, of all groups round all tables resembling one another, eating the same things, pulling the same crackers, taking the same indigestion remedies, watching the same telly. People who work at establishing how countercultural they are all the rest of the year suddenly yearn for convention. Republicans watch the Queen, talking. People with perfectly good Netflix accounts watch Downton Abbey. And with this convention comes a set of roles, chief among them the martyr. She does everything; she forgets nothing. The sweat on her brow can never evaporate in the humidity of everyone else’s expectation. She must be thanked – clapped, even – for her food even when it is disgusting. She gives great Asda advert and never sits down. She is the star turn of the season. She’s bigger than Jesus. The whole picture loses focus if she won’t at least pretend to be on the point of nervous exhaustion – the effort of which pretence is greater than actually being at that point for real. I don’t want to generalise. Not all women enjoy a weak piping time of peace. In an all-female household, the younger members will often roll up their sleeves and defy gender expectations to create the rage without which Christmas wouldn’t be Christmas. In the 90s, my sister attacked me on Boxing Day with a potato peeler, though luckily the rounded end rather than the peeling surface. So this point should be refined a bit: it’s not to women generally that the emotional labour of the season falls; it is to middle-aged women. Christmas is actually a situationist prank played on middle-aged women. Without it, there’s a danger that we would become too powerful. Nigella is in on it. The Christmas turkey: is it ever worth the bother? Read more",diasaster:0},

His congratulations followed a gala in the Kremlin on Saturday for spies, during which Putin praised the “efficient work” of intelligence officers in Syria, where Russian forces have been backing president Bashar al-Assad. He also said Russian security agencies had exposed 320 foreign spies in 2015 and prevented “more than 30 crimes of a terrorist nature”. Putin says Russia ready to increase military role in Syria Read more Putin, who served as a spy in East Germany in the 1980s and whose inner circle still includes many former intelligence agents, makes a point to congratulate his former comrades on their holiday each year. Unlike many former Eastern Bloc states that condemned atrocities by the Soviet security agencies after the dissolution of the USSR, Russia had no clean break with this part of its past. Security agency workers’ day was instituted by Boris Yeltsin in 1995, when he was leader, but was unofficially celebrated before that as “Cheka day”. Founded by Vladimir Lenin on 20 December 1917 and led by “Iron” Felix Dzerzhinsky, the Cheka arrested, tortured and killed thousands of people as part of the Red Terror, to consolidate Bolshevik power. Under Putin, past repressions have been cast in a more positive light. This year Memorial, a human rights group that documents victims of Soviet persecution, and Perm-36, which ran Russia’s only preserved gulag work camp, were both declared “foreign agents”. Perm-36 was forced to close, and the museum it oversaw now highlights the camp’s contribution to the Soviet victory in the second world war. Spies and Communists Read more Perceptions of Joseph Stalin have also improved in recent years, polling has shown. This summer, the Communist party spearheaded an effort to return a statue of Dzerzhinsky in front of the security service headquarters in downtown Moscow, although a fountain is now slated to be installed there instead. Also on Sunday, Putin made a special appearance on state television channel Rossiya 1, in which he said the “consistency” and “honesty” of Russia’s position on Syria gives it strength. He complained that Europe has “transferred part of its sovereignty” to the US and accused the west of continuing to act according to the “cliche of the cold war”.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Sports Personality of the Year: Andy Murray cruises to victory after Fury furore", "content": "After the comments and the controversy, the petition and the questions in parliament, came at last a result that was probably inevitable from the moment Andy Murray sent an inch-perfect lob over the head of Belgium’s David Goffin to secure Great Britain’s first Davis Cup in 79 years. Murray was named the BBC Sports Personality of the Year on Sunday in a star-studded ceremony in Belfast for the inspiring, pivotal role he played in that team victory. Andy Murray and Belfast the winners in Sports Personality of the Year Read more In a gracious, even nervous acceptance speech, the player joked about his reputation for lacking personality, and directed praise at his team-mates, who, he had earlier insisted, deserved to share in his nomination. He had never expected to win, he said later, “because there have been so many incredible performances this year”. Murray, who was added late to the list of nominations following the Davis Cup triumph last month, edged out world champion heptathlete Jessica Ennis-Hill, the early favourite, who came third, and the Leeds Rhinos player Kevin Sinfield, the first person ever nominated from rugby league, who was voted into an impressive second place. Absent from the winner’s platform, however – to the undoubted relief of 140,000 people who had signed a petition protesting at his inclusion on the shortlist – was the heavyweight world boxing champion Tyson Fury. The boxer had dominated coverage in the run-up to the BBC’s annual sporting shindig, after his victory over Wladimir Klitschko last month brought attention to comments he had earlier made linking homosexuality with paedophilia. Asked in a subsequent interview to explain his remarks, he instead chose to add that he believed a woman’s place was “in the kitchen and on her back”. Fury used his appearance in Belfast to offer an apology “if I have said anything in the past that has hurt anybody”. “It’s all a bit tongue-in-cheek and it’s all fun and games with me,” he said. That might have been more timely several weeks ago, before MPs had quizzed the BBC director general over Fury’s inclusion on the 12-strong shortlist, and Greater Manchester police briefly launched a hate crime investigation. A BBC news presenter called him a “dickhead”, and another was suspended for saying he was “ashamed” of the corporation for not excluding the boxer. The long jumper Greg Rutherford, nominated for the prize after adding world championship gold to his European, Commonwealth and Olympic titles in August, asked that his name be withdrawn from the contest in protest at Fury’s inclusion. He was later persuaded to change his mind. Outside the venue, a small but noisy gathering of protesters held banners reading “Furious at BBC” and chanted “Anti-women, anti-gay, Tyson Fury, go away”. Murray, a huge boxing fan, defended Fury after the ceremony to reporters, calling his win “an incredible achievement”. “Not everyone obviously has to agree with what he said but I do believe that he has the right to say it. That’s freedom of speech and people have the right to disagree with what he says as well.” But, as it happens, sport in 2015 was not all about Fury. Eight of the dozen nominees were individual world champions, including Mo Farah, who repeated his Olympic 5,000m and 10,000m double gold at the World Athletics Championships in August, and Max Whitlock, who became the first Briton ever to win artistic gymnastic gold in October, and performed a pommel horse routine on top of a grand piano in the 8,000-seater SSE arena. In quieter years, Lizzie Armitstead, the world road race cycling champion, double Tour de France winner Chris Froome, Formula One triple champion Lewis Hamilton or footballer Lucy Bronze, pivotal in England’s third-place finish at the World Cup in June, might have thought they were in with a shout. Swimmer Adam Peaty, who won three world championship golds in August and was the final name on the list, admitted to the Guardian before the event that he was “kind of starstruck … I’m only 20 years old. I’d just like to meet the other guys. Just be nice to get a glimpse of them, really.” Belfast city council and Tourism Northern Ireland had paid the BBC almost £240,000 for the privilege of hosting the event, and will have been delighted with the very Northern Irish event they got for their money. Local hero AP McCoy, roared to the rafters as he picked up a lifetime achievement award retiring after 20 seasons as champion jockey, thanked the stable lads and lasses who had helped him throughout his career, and in particular the horses he had ridden, “because without them it wouldn’t be possible”. Manager of the year went to Michael O’Neill, who coached the Northern Ireland football team to a place in the European Championships next year. The reception he received might have suggested the Euros were already won. And then there was Murray. The tennis player, currently ranked number two in the world, has won the title before, in 2013, and was placed an impressive third in the bumper year behind Bradley Wiggins and Ennis-Hill, but didn’t turn up in person on either occasion. But sweet as claiming the Wimbledon title must be, securing the Davis Cup, as part of a team that also included Kyle Edmund, James Ward and his brother, Jamie, was evidently even sweeter. Murray came to the ceremony dressed in the same blue suit as his teammates, and insisted before accepting the award that he felt awkward to be standing in front of them, saying: “We should be in a line”. Fittingly, in that case, they also won team of the year alongside him. Accepting the individual award, Murray said: “I have dedicated my life to this sport. I work as hard as I can every day to try to make you proud. And I appreciate all the votes.” The only bigger winner of the evening, in fact, was the BBC, which after watching its annual roundup show generate headlines and spark social media storms for weeks, will have been immensely satisfied with its conclusion: a withdrawal averted, a belated apology, and an eventual winner with whose achievement, even in such a successful sporting year, few could truly quibble. • This article was amended on 21 December 2015. An earlier version called Lewis Hamilton a double Formula One champion. This has been corrected. He has won the world championship three times.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"UK bosses cautious over pay rises in 2016", "content": "British employers expect to keep hiring permanent staff in 2016 but are cautious about offering meaningful pay rises, according to a survey from employers’ group CBI. In its annual employment outlook, the lobby group said some companies are also contemplating price hikes or recruitment freezes to offset higher labour costs from both the introduction of the “national living wage” in April and a new apprenticeship levy. National living wage is a gamble, says CBI boss Read more The CBI has called the changes the most significant interventions in the labour market since Tony Blair’s government introduced the minimum wage and other employment laws in the late 1990s. The business group also reiterated its scepticism over the likely effectiveness of the apprenticeship levy, which was confirmed in George Osborne’s autumn statement. “We live in an era of significant labour market interventions,” said CBI director for employment and skills, Neil Carberry. “The UK’s labour market is in fine fettle, though it’s clear that maintaining flexibility is of the utmost importance to employers. Companies are concerned about the apprenticeship levy and view it as a payroll tax, so the CBI is determined to work with the government to ensure that businesses see their money is spent in the best way.” The CBI’s survey of 342 employers, covering almost 1 million employees, found nearly half – 47% – anticipated the new levy would be “costly and bureaucratic”. But the survey was conducted between August and October, before Osborne confirmed details of the levy at 0.5% of an employer’s payroll, applying to companies with an annual wage bill of more than £3m. The government hopes the levy will help it hit a target of 3m apprenticeship starts by 2020. Business groups repeatedly complained about skills shortages this year but at the same time expressed reluctance to pay the apprenticeship levy. Carberry said employers surveyed by the CBI had expressed support for the aims of a levy and for funding it, but that there were worries the government wanted to hit targets for a quantity of apprenticeships rather than focusing on quality. The CBI’s employment survey, conducted with consultancy firm Accenture, reprises the theme of skills shortages, with respondents saying they were the top threat to the UK’s attractiveness as a place to do business for the second year running. The poll cited businesses’ rising concerns over getting the skilled workers they need as the economy heads towards full employment. More than two in five businesses, or 43%, expect their workforces to be larger in 12 months’ time while 13% expect their workforce to be smaller, according to the the survey. The number of new permanent jobs will outstrip temporary roles, the poll suggested. In the coming year, more than half of businesses, or 52%, said they intended to raise pay at least in line with the retail prices index (RPI) measure of inflation, which was 1.1% in November. That was little changed from the 55% planning to match or beat RPI in the same survey a year ago. Asked about the national living wage, which will push up the minimum hourly rate for workers aged 25 or older from £6.70 to £7.20, two-fifths of firms anticipated some impact. Of those employers who feel the national living wage will have an impact, 34% anticipate having to raise prices. More than a quarter, 28%, said they will be employing fewer people as a consequence. In the services sector, which includes businesses that tend to rely more on cheaper labour such as hotels and retailers, the expected effect on prices is more pronounced. Of those service sector employers who feel the national living wage will have an impact, 51% anticipate having to raise prices, 27% said they would employ fewer people and 18% said they would offset costs through changes to wider reward packages.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"The war drums are beating again – the Tories have begun their battle of Brexit", "content": "Liam Fox was once described to me by an ally of the prime minister as “the thinking man’s unthinking man”. Cruel, you might suppose. But the aperçu reflected respect as well as disdain. It is all too easily forgotten that Fox was at one point a plausible contender for the party leadership, as the ambassador from the Tory right to humankind, and punched above his weight as defence secretary before his resignation in October 2011 (over the access granted to his close friend, Adam Werritty). EU referendum: the next big populist wave could sweep Britain out of Europe | Jonathan Freedland Read more True, his decision to “end the pretence” and to announce his intention to campaign for withdrawal from the European Union has hardly shaken the timbers of No 10. But it cannot simply be dismissed as the premature intervention of a disgruntled backbencher. When Owen Paterson, the former environment secretary, backed the Vote Leave campaign in October, Downing Street officials shrugged. But, whatever his foes mutter to the contrary, Fox remains a substantial figure, well-versed in political theatre, who knew full well that his declaration of intent in a Sunday Times article would capture and exploit the sense of disappointment coursing through Conservative ranks after the Brussels summit. Cameron’s core demand – a four-year ban on EU migrants to the UK receiving in-work benefits – has scarcely progressed (though the prime minister asserts that his proposal “remains on the table”). It is not hard to decode Fox’s actions. While his former cabinet colleagues dither, he acts decisively, condemns the spectacle of Cameron trawling Europe with a “political begging bowl”. In a single article – followed by an interview on Sunday’s Andrew Marr Show – Fox has posed a challenge that may change the terms of trade drastically. To explain: the essence of Cameron’s EU strategy has been to keep the process flexible for as long as possible. His priority after last week’s summit was to declare that a “pathway” garlanded with goodwill had opened up, rather than to enumerate the victories or defeats chalked up for the British delegation. In this grand projet, the true objective is navigational: Cameron wants to persuade biddable waverers that the direction of travel in Brussels is at last sympathetic to Britain. What he calls “renegotiation” is a means to an end – probably a fairly modest end. But it is also an end in itself. It is a public process designed to enable Eurosceptics to campaign for Britain to stay in the EU and not surrender their dignity. The diplomatic process to which Cameron is committed is symbolic before it is substantial. The trouble is that, all too often, symbols become grittily real, weighed down with emotion, ambition and reanimated rivalry. Fox has taken the abstractions of EU jurisprudence and diplomatic conversations and turned them into flesh and blood. And this the prime minister emphatically does not want to happen – at least, not yet. Most Tory MPs leaning towards Brexit, says party’s leave group chair Read more For if Fox will definitely campaign to leave, what will Boris Johnson say and do, and when? And would London’s mayor turn down a cabinet job to retain the freedom to campaign as he pleases in the referendum? Theresa May, the home secretary, a politician who sometimes looks as though she might drown in her sense of destiny, has conspicuously declined to rule out heading the campaign for Brexit. Fox’s prescription will also force Cameron to confront one of the toughest decisions of his career. There are said to be six or seven cabinet members who are minded to campaign for withdrawal: Iain Duncan Smith, Theresa Villiers, Chris Grayling, John Whittingdale, Michael Gove, Priti Patel and Oliver Letwin. Again, this list should be treated with great caution. In 2012, for example, Gove signalled that he would support withdrawal – but only if the relationship between Britain and the EU remained as it was. As he explained the following year: “My ideal is exactly what the majority of the population think, which is that the present situation is no good, to say that life outside would be perfectly tolerable … We could contemplate it, there would be certain advantages. But the best deal for Britain and Europe is for Britain to lead the changes that Europe needs.” Which is essentially Cameron’s position. Does that make Gove a Brexit rebel? Hardly. This illustrates precisely what Cameron was trying to achieve. Not trench warfare between big beasts and celebrity politicians, between those who model themselves on Thatcher, those who model themselves on Churchill, and those who model themselves on both, but a prolonged exercise in compromise and deal-making that steadily recalibrated the instrumentation in Brussels to the advantage of Britain. As Jeremy Corbyn made very clear indeed in the Commons debate on air-strikes on 2 December, party leaders hate indiscipline, free votes and dissent in public. According to one Downing Street source: “We’ll decide when the deal is done about questions like cabinet collective responsibility.” But how will they handle it when the moment arises? As one cabinet minister who will definitely campaign for Brexit puts it: “I want to carry on working for Dave but this is a colossal moment. I could not remain silent simply to save my own government job.” In 1970, Jim Callaghan foretold that the referendum on EEC membership was “a little rubber life raft into which the whole party may one day have to climb”. And so it proved in 1975: Callaghan himself, Roy Jenkins and Denis Healey campaigned for a yes vote, while Tony Benn and Michael Foot called for Britain to end its association with the Common Market. The gravitational pull of a similar arrangement in this referendum will be immense. Cameron will seek an alternative, of course: some cunning means of enforcing his will on the Tory oligarchy. But the temporary suspension of cabinet collective responsibility is the only device available to him that will not ignite the flames of tribal mayhem. So here the Tories are again, “banging on about Europe”, cathartically, perhaps, but not once and for all, or definitively. Ronald Reagan used to speak of the California Republican party’s unofficial 11th commandment: “Thou shalt not speak ill of another Republican.” As a season of crisis approaches the Tories, they would do well to adapt and adopt this slogan. Corbyn can’t beat the Conservatives, but the Conservatives, unleashed, unthinking, untamed, might conceivably do the job for him. Fox has changed the European argument with a few well-chosen phrases. The battle of Brexit is no longer just business. As will become ferociously clear in 2016, it all just got exceedingly personal.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Greece plunged into crisis as failure to elect president sets up snap election", "content": "Fears were growing on Monday night of a fresh crisis in the eurozone after Greece failed to elect a head of state, triggering a snap election that is tipped to bring radical, anti-austerity leftists to power. The Athens stock exchange slumped by more than 10% at one point as concerns mounted over the political turmoil likely to hit the twice bailed-out country. The effective interest rate on the nation’s three-year debt soared to more than 12% – signalling investor fears that Greece will not be able to repay its loans in the short term. Elections were called for 25 January after the government failed to find enough votes to elect its preferred candidate for president, the former European commissioner Stavros Dimas. With the vehemently anti-cuts Syriza opposition ahead in the polls, the campaign will now revive the debate about austerity policies across the eurozone and raise questions over the harsh terms attached to Greece’s €240bn (£188bn) bailouts. The leftists have declared that renegotiation of the accords Athens has signed with the EU, European Central Bank (ECB) and International Monetary Fund – the lenders that have kept the country afloat – will be among its top priorities. Syriza would also seek to write off the country’s monumental €320bn debt – an aim that has revived fears of Greece clashing with creditors and being ejected from the eurozone. The new threat comes six years after the country’s near economic collapse first sent panic through global markets and two years after prime minister Antonio Samaras came to power with his conservative-dominated two-party alliance. Following the vote, Syriza’s leader, Alexis Tsipras, said the country had experienced “a historic day”, adding: “In a few days the Samaras government, which pillaged the country, will belong to the past, as will the memoranda of austerity.” Athens’s 300-seat house voted by 168-132 in favour of Dimas, the sole candidate for the post of president – falling short of the 180 votes required for his installation. Market analysts said there could be wider repercussions, including for the ECB, which is due to meet just days before the election to discuss monetary policy and debate the prospect of embarking on injecting billions into the eurozone’s economies through quantitative easing (QE) – or electronic money-printing. The ECB has so far held off from QE despite speculation earlier this month that it was ready to act to bolster economic growth in the face of inflation which has fallen to 0.3%, dangerously close to outright deflation. Alastair McCaig, market analyst at IG UK, said: “Although this is a specific issue for Greece, it will raise fresh fears over the fate of the eurozone and the timelines for the possible implementation of a European version of QE. 2015 could see an escalation in the debate over austerity, with the same old north-south divide on what is proportional still raging”. The IMF played down fears of any immediate funding crisis for Greece and will embark on its delayed review of the terms attached to the bailout programme once the new government is in place. “Discussions with the Greek authorities on the completion of the sixth review of the programme … will resume once a new government is in place, in consultation with the European commission and the ECB. Greece faces no immediate financing needs,” the IMF said. The EU’s commissioner for economic and finance affairs, Pierre Moscovici, said the Greeks needed “a strong commitment to Europe” and support “for the necessary growth-friendly reform process will be essential for Greece to thrive again within the euro area”. After failing to find enough support, Dimas said: “The number of 168 votes is a clear parliamentary majority but as the constitution foresees it does not allow my election … what is important, now, is the interests of the country and the Greek people … what unites us is Greece.” Greek law says parliament must be dissolved within 10 days and a poll held within 30. Samaras said: “Tomorrow I will go to the president of the republic to request snap polls as early as possible on 25 January. It is the hour of democracy, which means truth and responsibility, not populism.” Christos Pappas, the jailed second-in-command of the neo-Nazi Golden Dawn party, was the first to announce he would not be voting for the government’s candidate. Independent MPs, whom Samaras had hoped to sway in this, the final round of a three-stage vote, followed suit.

Police said the local man, who was driving a Land Rover Defender, was pronounced dead at the scene of the crash near Horam, East Sussex, at 7am. Emergency services trying to get to the scene were hampered by temperatures of around -2C and sheet ice. The mercury plunged to -8.8C in Katesbridge, County Down, in Northern Ireland, overnight – not out of the ordinary for December but setting a new low for the year after last winter’s relatively mild and wet conditions. There were also regional lows of -7.6C in Benson, Oxfordshire, and -6.7C in Pembrey Sands, Dyfed, Wales. The Met Office warned of icy driving conditions in eastern Humberside, eastern Lincolnshire and northern East Anglia on Monday morning. The Highways Agency also advised motorists to be aware of driving conditions. A cold but dry day is expected across the UK with some winter sunshine. A lack of wind chill means it could feel relatively mild before temperatures fall again overnight. The Met Office meteorologist Mark Wilson said: “Away from western Scotland, it’s another cold night across the UK. Temperatures across the country will be below freezing in towns and cities.

{ "title":"Scottish government’s oil revenue forecast ‘out by £15.5bn’", "content": "The Scottish government’s oil revenue forecast for the first three years had Scots voted in favour of independence is now out by £15.5bn, according to the Scotland secretary. Alistair Carmichael said the latest analysis by the UK government showed that, 100 days after the referendum, an independent Scotland would have been facing the shortfall following a drop in oil prices. He said serious questions needed to be asked about how the SNP administration “got this so badly wrong”. UK government figures claim that the current falling price of oil would provide £4.7bn for an independent Scotland between 2016-17 and 2018-19. This is in contrast to Scottish government predictions of £20.2bn being generated over the same period. Carmichael said: “On referendum day, Nicola Sturgeon and John Swinney were predicting ‘a second oil boom’. Scottish government economists were telling us the oil price would be $110 per barrel. “Now, just 100 days later, with the oil price actually standing at $60, there is a £15.5bn hole in the finances of independence. That is a £155m mistake for every day that has passed since the referendum. “We were making a decision that Scots were going to have to live with forever and the Scottish government are sticking to wildly optimistic oil predictions that have not even made it to the new year.” Carmichael said steps should be taken to restore confidence in future oil analysis. A spokesman for Swinney, Scotland’s deputy first minister, said: “This is staggering hypocrisy from Alistair Carmichael, whose own UK government’s energy department was last year forecasting oil prices to reach $134 a barrel in 2018 – substantially more than the Scottish government’s March 2013 price projection. “Instead of, bizarrely, gloating over his own government’s lower-than-expected revenues, Mr Carmichael should be doing all he can to help the industry, which has too often been subject to wildly fluctuating taxation from successive Westminster governments. “Oil is a bonus, not the basis of Scotland’s economy, and will be a fantastic asset for Scotland for decades to come, with as much in value still to come as has already been extracted.”",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"The Guardian view on Donald Trump’s team: not the new normal", "content": "The idea that Donald Trump might become a “normal” American president once he moved into the White House was always for the birds. The 2016 contest was an abnormal election won by an abnormal politician. It was an abnormal election because hackers linked to the Russian government worked to help Mr Trump’s cause; because the head of the FBI tossed a political hand grenade into the closing stages of the contest which helped Mr Trump’s cause; and because, since a US supreme court ruling in 2013, states that want to have exploited a power to impose voter ID rules that intentionally keep African Americans off the rolls. Oh, and 2.8 million more Americans voted for Hillary Clinton than Mr Trump. That’s hardly normal either. Mr Trump was and remains an abnormal politician because he threatens changes that, with almost no exception, are genuinely destructive to American values and interests, not least to the interests of many of those white working-class voters who voted for him in the hope of change. He has now assembled a government team which, again almost without exception, testifies to this reality. These appointments confirm that he cannot be regarded as a president like any other. Perhaps, in five weeks’ time, when he actually succeeds Barack Obama in the Oval Office, he will start to do things that suggest otherwise. But that has not happened yet. The first threat from the new appointments is that it is Team Corporate America. The new secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, is one of the biggest oil moguls on the planet, chief executive of ExxonMobil, friend of Vladimir Putin and the Middle Eastern petrolocracies. The new energy secretary, Rick Perry, is an oilman and a climate change sceptic. Scott Pruitt, the new head of the Environmental Protection Agency, a body he would like to see closed down, holds those prejudices even more strongly. This will be a pro-carbon, pro-drilling and anti-climate change administration like no other. It is also political Christmas for the Wall Street bankers. The new Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, is a former Goldman Sachs investment banker whose stated priority is to cut corporate taxation by more than half. He will join former Goldman banker and Breitbart chief Stephen Bannon, Mr Trump’s ultra-rightwing chief strategist, and the Goldman president, Gary Cohn, who will become, in effect, the new president’s chief economic adviser. Mr Trump may have railed against bankers, and Goldman in particular, during the campaign, but he has put them at the heart of his economic thinking. The third fox in the governmental hen house is the military. Mr Trump said during the campaign that he knew “more than the generals” about the threat from Islamic State. But the generals will occupy key roles in his administration to such a degree that the head of Human Rights Watch has said there will be a whiff of “military junta” about it. With James Mattis at defence, the temperamental Islamophobe Michael Flynn as national security adviser, John Kelly in charge of the enormous homeland security bureaucracy and Mike Pompeo as the new CIA director, military men have seized some key jobs. Whether this heralds the politicisation of the military or the militarisation of politics will be a key question. Mr Trump’s appointments also point unerringly towards the dismantling of federal government programmes in other crucial areas. Making Andrew Puzder labor secretary puts an opponent of raising the minimum wage in charge of it. Betsy DeVos at education will be a privatiser running public schools policy. Tom Price at health and human services is both an arch-critic of Mr Obama’s affordable care programme and a privatiser of the Medicare retirement care programme. Ben Carson at housing and urban development does not agree with government safety nets. Overall, the military will prosper at the expense of the poor. Guns not healthcare. There is nothing normal about any of this; just as there is nothing normal about appointing Jeff Sessions, the Alabaman who has spent years in the Senate trying to roll back voting rights for African Americans, attorney general; and nothing normal about the expected appointment of an anti-choice justice to take the vacancy on the supreme court. In heavily tainted circumstances, America has elected a president who seems wholly unable to distinguish between private interest and public responsibility. As long as Mr Trump does so little to respect his own office, it is hard for others to respect him and it as they would normally.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Yahoo hack: 1bn accounts compromised by biggest data breach in history", "content": "Yahoo said on Wednesday it had discovered another major cyber attack, saying data from more than 1bn user accounts was compromised in August 2013, making it the largest such breach in history. The number of affected accounts was double the number implicated in a 2014 breach that the internet company disclosed in September and blamed on hackers working on behalf of a government. “An unauthorised party” broke into the accounts, Yahoo said in a statement posted on its website. The company believes the hacks are connected and that the breaches are “state-sponsored”. Senators call Yahoo's delay in revealing breach of 500m accounts 'unacceptable' Read more The hackers used “forged ‘cookies’” – bits of code that stay in the user’s browser cache so that a website doesn’t require a login with every visit, wrote Yahoo’s chief information security officer, Bob Lord. The cookies “could allow an intruder to access users’ accounts without a password” by misidentifying anyone using them as the owner of an email account. The breach may be related to theft of Yahoo’s proprietary code, Lord said. The company began to suspect the breach in November, when law enforcement approached the company with what a third party claimed was “user data;” Lord’s post suggests that the data included forged cookies. “For years I have been urging friends and family to migrate off of Yahoo email, mainly because I watched for years as the company appeared to fall far behind its peers in blocking spam and other email-based attacks,” wrote security researcher Brian Krebs as news of the attack broke. “I stand by that recommendation.” Yahoo said the stolen user account information may have included names, email addresses, telephone numbers, dates of birth, hashed passwords and, in some cases, encrypted or unencrypted security questions and answers. After Yahoo revealed the smaller – but still historic – security breach in September, six US senators sent Yahoo a letter demanding the company reveal exactly when it had learned of the intrusion. Vermont senator Patrick Leahy, ranking member of the senate judiciary committe, called for a hearing; no hearing has been scheduled thus far. The senators, including Leahy, said they were “disturbed that user information was first compromised in 2014, yet the company only announced the breach last week.” The six legislators found the reveleation that “millions of Americans’ data may have been compromised for two years” to be “unacceptable.” The company is being acquired by Verizon for $4.8bn but the sale has not been an easy one. In October, a report revealed that the company had cooperated with the NSA to scan users’ emails for keywords on behalf of the agency. A Verizon lawyer, Craig Silliman, said that the September breach had clearly damaged Yahoo’s value and hinted that the damage ought to be reflected in the buying price. “I think we have a reasonable basis to believe right now that the impact is material and we’re looking to Yahoo to demonstrate to us the full impact,” Silliman told reporters in October. “If they believe that it’s not, then they’ll need to show us that.” Email breaches remain especially vexing to users, since they can reveal bank and family details as well as passwords that users share between systems or have received in their email accounts. Password-sharing has become so common that databases of login information are often used by hackers to test for email-and-password combinations on retailer websites like Walmart or Amazon. Payment card data and bank account information were not stored in the system believed to be affected, the company said. Yahoo is notifying all the users affected and asking them to change their passwords. Yahoo owns assets far beyond its popular webmail service and its news site: other properties include blogging platform Tumblr and photo-sharing site Flickr, as well as Yahoo Finance.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Martha Argerich/Alberto Portugheis review – one listens instinctively to Argerich", "content": "Every appearance by Martha Argerich is inescapably an event. She is such an exceptional pianist by any standard, and her visits anywhere were for many years such rarities that she long ago acquired a legendary status. But there is a problem. The problem with Argerich’s appearances is not, as it once was, whether she would actually turn up. These days, she plays in the UK a lot – steely Liszt at this summer’s Proms, the Schumann concerto a few weeks later, and this Wigmore Hall concert, only her third appearance at the venue in 40 years. Argerich is back in January too, playing Prokofiev. It’s a bumper period for her legions of admirers. The problem is that for many years now Argerich has been uncomfortable playing on her own in public. It’s certainly not that, at 75, she can’t any longer play the solo repertoire; her technique remains utterly formidable. It’s just that she nowadays seems to depend on the presence of other musicians to coax her out on to a public platform. Even then, she is visibly uneasy in the spotlight. This can bring amazing musical rewards in concertos and chamber music. But it means that an Argerich appearance is now also dependent on the players with whom she shares the platform. That’s especially true in the tricky four-handed and two-piano repertoire that she has favoured recently with partners including Daniel Barenboim. And the truth about this joint 75th birthday concert with her fellow Argentinian veteran Alberto Portugheis is that the pairing proved too unequal. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Uneven... Martha Argerich and Alberto Portugheis (and page turners) at the Wigmore Hall, London Photograph: Tristram Kenton for the Guardian They began with the Mozart sonata in D for two pianos, side by side, Portugheis at the front of the stage, Argerich behind him, practically invisible from my seat. The allegro was dispatched with terrific energy, but Argerich’s surer touch and richer tone was easy to discern in the andante, as were some characteristically dramatic runs in the finale. Rachmaninov’s Six Pieces for duet Opus 11, written in 1894 and played in four hands on one instrument, fared less well. This music is top-drawer Rachmaninov, but the coordination and balance was often uncertain, and it felt too often as if one was trying to listen to Argerich through the confused texture of Portugheis’s playing. Things improved greatly after the interval, principally because Argerich and Portugheis changed places, so that now she took the primo part in Ravel’s Ma Mère l’Oye pieces. Argerich’s weighting of Ravel’s delicate and supple upper lines was ideal, and at the end of the second piece she achieved more expression from a single chord than might seem rationally possible. Her perfectly judged glissando sweeps at the end of the sequence will stay in the memory. Brahms is not a composer much associated with Argerich, but the way she took charge in the two-piano version of the composer’s Variations on a Theme by Haydn made one wish she played him more. Once again, it was Argerich to whom one instinctively listened rather than Portugheis. Two encores followed, by Piazzolla and Milhaud, each rather haphazardly executed.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"ER Braithwaite obituary", "content": "When ER Braithwaite, who has died aged 104, found doors closed to him in Britain because of his colour, he reacted by writing a novel, To Sir, With Love (1959), which became an international bestseller and was made into a film starring Sidney Poitier. Though he went on to write five other novels, often dealing with black-white relations, none had the impact of his first. It was autobiographical in that it depicted a teacher called Ricky Braithwaite (the character was renamed Mark Thackeray in the film), who, like the author, a wartime RAF pilot and physics PhD, possessed substantial qualifications. He also took the tough teaching and discipline methods that he had been subjected to in his native British Guiana (now Guyana) to Stepney, in the East End of London. Braithwaite was the product of the colony’s best school – Queen’s college – which even as late as the 1970s retained the air of an Edwardian public school. The Braithwaite of the novel insists on treating his semi-literate white working-class students with respect and calls on them to do the same to him and each other. They are not receptive to such an approach and regard him with contempt, not least due to his colour, as do some of his colleagues in the staff room. Facebook Twitter Pinterest To Sir, With Love, 1967, starring Sidney Poitier as Mark Thackeray (in the book the teacher is called Ricky Braithwaite) The teacher turns the situation round through thrashing one of the students in a boxing match, then declining to make him grovel, through encouraging discussion and organising a museum visit, and by challenging the students’ reluctance to deliver a condolence wreath when the mother of one of them dies, because her husband is black. However, at the point where he is ready to despair of them, the entire class attends the funeral, and love and respect are seen to prevail over discrimination. Braithwaite helps his students become more articulate and they soften his patrician manner. While writing the book, Braithwaite became a London county council social worker (1958-60), finding foster homes for non-white children. His experiences there provided the basis for his second novel, Paid Servant (1962). The real impact of To Sir came when it was made into a feature film in 1967, with a title song sung by a young Lulu, who also appeared as one of the students. The white colleague with whom Thackeray falls in love was played by Suzy Kendall, and the screenwriter and director, James Clavell, transposed the setting to the swinging 60s. Though Braithwaite found this version rather sentimental – he said, “the movie made it look like fun and games” – the story’s popularity persisted for the rest of his life, making his name as a literary figure. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Sidney Poitier and Judy Geeson in To Sir, With Love. Photograph: Moviestore Collection/Rex A television film version followed in 1974, with a US high school teacher on an exchange to London, and in 1996 Poitier starred in To Sir, With Love II, a television sequel to the original film, in which Thackeray retires from his London post only to take one up at an inner-city school in Chicago. In 2007, Kwame Kwei-Armah starred in a dramatisation for BBC Radio 4. As Braithwaite admitted that year when accepting a lifetime achievement award from the Guyana Cultural Association in New York: “I feel fortunate that this piece of work I did 50 years ago is still well and alive. I have some assurance that this little book will outlive me and the interest of others for years to come.” Edward Ricardo Braithwaite was born in Georgetown, the capital of British Guiana. His mother and father were graduates of Oxford University, in history and engineering respectively, and the latter was a gold and diamond miner. The then emerging black middle class in British Guiana were very literary: homes had libraries and Shakespeare was widely read and widely quoted. The empire was firmly embedded in the intellect of its subjects. In 1940 Braithwaite, went to study at the City College of New York, and then to the UK, where he joined the Royal Air Force as a pilot – one of the very few non-white airmen, though in the RAF he did not feel discriminated against. After the second world war he gained a bachelor’s degree and a doctorate in physics from Cambridge University. Job applications proved fruitless until he landed a post at St George-in-the-East secondary school, Stepney (1950-57). Like many other educated middle-class Guyanese, Braithwaite found solace in the proper use of the language of his youth: “I write because I enjoy putting words together, and composing them in such a way that readers feel the excitement I feel.” Disillusioned with Britain, Braithwaite left for Paris, working as a human rights officer for the World Veterans Federation (1960-63) and then as an education consultant to Unesco (1963-66). Guyana achieved independence, and the prime minister, Forbes Burnham, appointed Braithwaite as the country’s permanent representative to the United Nations (1966-68), and then ambassador to Venezuela (1968-70). This was a much more fraught position, since the two countries had historically had a fractious relationship, with Venezuela claiming much of Guyana’s territory. Braithwaite managed to put affairs on a more even keel and helped to negotiate a temporary settlement between the neighbours, which still holds. From the diplomatic service, Braithwaite moved to academia, with writer- in-residence appointments at New York University, Florida State University and Howard University, Washington. In 1973 the South African government lifted a ban on his books. The visa status he was given for a visit there – more privileged than for indigenous black people, but less privileged than for white people – provided the title for his account of the experience, Honorary White (1976). Having settled in Washington, he marked his centenary in 2012 by returning to Guyana to receive the country’s highest honour, the Cacique’s Crown, and the following year toured Europe to give lectures for the US state department. He is survived by his companion, Ginette Ast. • Edward Ricardo Braithwaite, writer, teacher and diplomat, born 27 June 1912; died 12 December 2016",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Voter apathy not just an issue for cities", "content": "In his analysis of the extent to which rural and small-town voters may be having an increasing impact on the outcome of elections, Andy Beckett writes that people living in cities are often too “transient, overcommitted, easily distracted” to vote or even to register to vote (Cities may dominate our culture but real power now lies in the countryside, 13 December). In that case, an even worse level of distraction must have infected voters in the recent Sleaford and North Hykeham byelection, in which there was a dismally low 37.1% turnout. This constituency, in which I live, typifies the kind of area Beckett believes is now in the ascendant. Yet the whole byelection campaign was typified by an overwhelming sense of apathy and resignation. The county newspaper, the Lincolnshire Echo, hardly featured it; there was a conspicuous absence of the customary evidence of political allegiance in voters’ windows; and even though some leading political figures visited the constituency, none generated a buzz, possibly because the constituency has consistently returned a Tory MP since its inception. Two parties, Ukip and Labour, couldn’t even be bothered to spell the name of the constituency correctly. There may be much substance to what Andy Beckett says about urban voter apathy and the probability that boundary changes to parliamentary constituencies will marginalise cities further. But the recent evidence of “true blue” Sleaford and North Hykeham is a sobering reminder that rural and small-town voters are just as capable of apathy and indifference as urban ones. David Head Lincoln • The opinion piece by Andy Beckett claimed that the vote for Brexit was led by rural and small-town voters. The evidence for this is unconvincing and the picture is far more complex. Analysis of the referendum results shows that 53.4% of English votes were cast for leave. In the rural areas of England, 55.5% of votes were cast for leave. So just 2.1% greater, and hardly the stark division described in Beckett’s piece. In fact, the category of area where the highest proportion voted for leave was that called “urban with minor conurbation”, consisting of mainly ex-industrial places. Brian Wilson Bridport, Dorset • I am surprised, not to say amazed that you’ve published no letters from readers commenting on the information in the small news item tucked away at the end of the finance pages (New Year jobs boost likely say UK employers, 13 December) wherein it states that “more than half of all the jobs created by UK employers this year went to EU workers”.

{ "title":"UK military could allow women in frontline by end of 2016", "content": "Women could be allowed to fight on the frontline within the year as part of the biggest shakeup of the British military in its recent history. David Cameron has asked the Ministry of Defence to be ready to welcome women into close combat roles by the end of 2016. The long-mooted move would speed up the implementation of a review of the policy when it concludes before the summer. The prime minister said: “The defence secretary [Michael Fallon] and I are united in wanting to see all roles in our armed forces opened up to women in 2016. We’ve already lifted a number of barriers in our armed forces with the introduction of female submariners and women reaching the highest ranks in all services. “We should finish the job next year and open up ground combat roles to women.” A review paper was published in December 2014 and as a result, further research is under way looking at the physiological demands on those carrying out ground combat roles. The research programme is expected to deliver an initial report in mid-2016. A decision to open up all roles to women would put the UK alongside other nations including Australia – which has legislated for this – and the US, which announced this month it would open all jobs in combat roles to women. The prime minister’s intervention would see women begin training for these roles as early as autumn next year. The government is already putting in place procedures to ensure women are aware of and able to take up the new opportunities, including working with recruitment organisations. More than 80% of jobs across the armed forces are currently open to women, who make up more than 10% of the military’s manpower. Jobs on the frontline were opened to women two decades ago, notably in the artillery, engineers and combat medics. The new changes would predominantly apply to those roles in the infantry, Royal Marines, Royal Armoured Corps and the Royal Air Force Regiment. Adm Alan West, who was first sea lord and then served as Labour security minister, said he retained “some nervousness about women in the infantry and the Royal Marines, where they have to actually advance on the enemy, climb into a trench and fight and kill each other. “Not because there aren’t some women who can do that but in general terms, when you are looking at averages, women have one-third less upper body strength,” Lord West told the Sky News Murnaghan programme. “I want forces that can win. And why don’t we have women in the England men’s rugby team? Because actually they don’t have the same size, power and all of these sort of things. “There is no doubt at all that women are very, very brave. We have always been willing to let women die in wars and actually they are very competent, particularly at computer operating – they have longer concentration power than men.” The shadow defence secretary, Maria Eagle, said: “The government must do more to ensure that the armed forces better reflect the society they serve. “This would mark a vital step towards achieving this goal and would bring us into line with many of the UK’s allies, many of whom have a more equal gender balance in their forces. “With recruitment having stalled, ministers need to get on with delivering more flexible career options for those interested in joining the services.”",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"UK government too slow to save steel industry, MPs conclude", "content": "The UK government reacted too slowly to the crisis in the steel industry that has caused more than 5,000 job losses and left the sector permanently damaged, a parliamentary committee has said. Although the government viewed the steel industry as important, it did not respond to warning signals about its mounting problems, which included reduced demand, falling prices and dumping of cheap steel by China, according to a report backed by all MPs on the business, innovation and skills committee. When Sajid Javid, the business secretary, and other ministers woke up to the crisis, they did not do enough to keep plants open and instead concentrated on compensating workers affected. This led to a permanent loss of skills and the closure of plants that will never reopen. Can the government save Britain's ailing steel industry? Read more Iain Wright, the Labour chairman of the committee, said: “The steel industry is now on the verge of terminal decline. For too long the government failed to be alert to the alarms raised by the industry and act at home to maintain a steel industry in the UK when other European countries were acting to safeguard their own strategic steel industries.” The closure of SSI’s plant at Redcar on Teesside in October brought home the extent of the crisis. After almost 100 years in operation, Europe’s second-biggest blast furnace shut with the loss of 1,700 jobs and wider consequences for the struggling local economy. Further job cuts and mothballing of plants followed at Tata Steel’s sites in Scunthorpe and Scotland. Wright said: “My concern is that the government should have explored much more thoroughly options to keep the Redcar plant open to retain the industrial assets and the skills rather than washing its hands too quickly, allowing it to close down and inflict severe damage on future manufacturing capability. “Failure to consider effective mothballing not only undermines capability for the UK steel industry in the future but could cost the taxpayer a fortune in clean-up costs.” The committee said the problem of Chinese dumping needed to be resolved for the UK’s steel industry to be viable and that the government did not push the European Union hard enough to repel dumping by China. The committee said steel’s malaise was due to complacency by successive governments but that the current government was slow to act on proposals put forward by the sector, including relief from business rates and high energy bills, and greater government support when it buys steel for big projects. Wright said: “The government has relied on crisis management rather than ongoing engagement with the steel industry. Steel is a strategic industry and ministers have recognised its strategic importance. The inaction with steel doesn’t bode well for other strategic industries if they were to face a crisis.” The government should act quickly on the main proposals from the industry and should work with the sector in general to examine whether policy decisions threaten other important sectors, the MPs said. They called for a more active industrial policy and for the government to spell out how it will work to avoid a repeat of steel’s problems. The business, innovation and skills department said the government had taken action on relief for energy costs, anti-dumping, procurement and European emissions directives. “While the government is doing all it can to help the industry, the government cannot dictate the commercial decisions, operations or financial performance of private companies.” The official rejected the committee’s criticism over the government’s handling of Redcar’s closure and said SSI UK had suffered £600m of losses in three years and amassed high debts. “If the select committee had a magic bullet that could have saved the plant against these conditions, they certainly kept it to themselves,” the official added.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"AirAsia flight QZ8501 disappearance caps difficult year for airline industry", "content": "Despite the fact that flying remains, as the aviation industry likes to stress, statistically the safest form of transport, the likely loss of a third airliner in the space of 10 months appears to have made 2014 the deadliest year for passengers in almost a decade. The still unexplained disappearance of Malaysian Airlines flight MH370 in March and the shooting down of the same airline’s flight MH17 over war-torn eastern Ukraine four months later cost 239 and 298 lives respectively. Now it appears probable that another 162 fatalities will be added to the year’s toll. Although it remains unclear exactly what happened to AirAsia flight QZ8501, authorities are relatively certain they will find tragic confirmation at the bottom of the Java Sea. Until this week’s loss, the safety record of major airlines had been on a fairly constant upward trajectory since 2005 on most counts. According to the Flight Safety Foundation, there has been a steady fall in the number of airline crashes, and the number of fatal incidents involving large passenger jets this year was 19, a record low in modern aviation (their count excludes the shooting down of MH17 as a military action). But the Bureau of Aircraft Accident Archives, which includes smaller planes and military transport planes, puts the total number of fatalities for 2014 at 1,320, assuming no survivors from QZ8501 – the worst annual toll since 2005. The fact that three incidents have accounted for the majority of fatalities could, on one level, bolster the industry message of increased safety. The big European short-haul carriers such as Ryanair and easyJet can still boast an accident-free history. But in an era when the trend appeared to point to a zero-casualty future, the nature of this year’s catastrophes has been a nasty wake-up call. The International Air Transport Association, Iata, which represents most large airlines worldwide, as recently as 2012 boasted of an zero annual crash record – or zero “western-built jet hull losses” – among its members. Safety and security remained an ongoing concern, and no one at Iata betrayed any sense of complacency. In some parts of the world, such as Africa, incident rates were far higher, if falling. There was work to do on limiting “runway excursions”, which accounted for the majority of accidents. But the message was fairly clear: if you flew on a on a new plane with a major airline that had signed up to the safety standards, you could more or less relax. Now, two Boeing 777 airliners flown by a major scheduled carrier, Malaysia Airlines – British Airways’ partner in OneWorld – from major hubs have met their end. The Airbus A320 lost by AirAsia is a plane that dots the skies from Heathrow to Honolulu. The industry response to the new categories of disaster thrown up by MH370 and MH17 has been to assemble taskforces to report to the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), a UN oversight body, with recommendations for possible future action on flight tracking and on sharing information about overflying conflict zones. The plethora of chilling scenarios conjured up by the disappearance of MH370 should keep driving the search for its wreckage. It seems there are few parallels with QZ8501, but should there be any sizeable duration before the latest lost plane is found, the industry’s ponderous moves on aircraft tracking could look like unpardonable foot-dragging. While the priority given to safety is a knee-jerk mantra recited by all airline executives, an acceptable level of risk versus cost has to infuse all industry thinking, especially in a business whose profit margins in recent years have been slim. The calculations run from how tired your pilots can be to how little you can pay your crew, to whether you really need that state-of-the-art tracking system. How many airlines really need to invest in the all-frills package touted by Inmarsat? What chance of any plane escaping detection given the various tracking systems in place? But then the unthinkable happened. The upbeat assessment is that air crashes are ever rarer, and so we simply perceive them more closely. Tracking websites show every plane’s path, the global 24-hour news cycle provides footage of grieving relatives, while transport ministers and celebrity airline executives tweet their movements in real time. Should pilot error in a freakishly bad storm have sent flight QZ8501 to the bottom of the Java Sea, it will be recorded as another unhappy episode in Indonesia’s troubled aviation history. The real nightmare scenario for the industry is that once again the reason remains unknown – with at least one expert warning that the technology in planes or traffic control systems could prove susceptible to a cyber threat.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Top Democrat's emails hacked by Russia after aide made typo, investigation finds", "content": "Russian hackers were able to access thousands of emails from a top-ranking Democrat after an aide typed the word “legitimate” instead of “illegitimate” by mistake, an investigation by the New York Times has found. The revelation gives further credence to the CIA’s finding last week that the Kremlin deliberately intervened in the US presidential election to help Donald Trump. The president-elect has angrily denied the CIA’s assessment, calling it “ridiculous”. In the run-up to the election, the US Democratic National Committee (DNC) received numerous phishing emails, the paper reported on Tuesday. One of them was also sent to John Podesta, the chairman of Hillary Clinton’s campaign. An aide, Charles Delavan, spotted the message sent to Podesta’s private account. It asked Podesta to change his password. CIA concludes Russia interfered to help Trump win election, say reports Read more Delavan realised the email was a phishing attack and forwarded it to a computer technician. However, he made a typo, writing: “This is a legitimate email.” He added: “John needs to change his password immediately.” The blunder gave Kremlin hackers access to about 60,000 emails in Podesta’s private Gmail account. According to US intelligence officials, Moscow then gave the email cache to WikiLeaks. The website released them in October, and the email scandal dominated the news cycle and was exploited by Trump. The FBI had known for some time that Russia was making a wide-ranging and systematic attempt to hack US political institutions including the White House and the State Department, the paper reported. In September 2015 the FBI discovered that a cyber-espionage team linked to the Russian government had penetrated the DNC. But instead of sending a top-level delegation and raising the alarm, the FBI got a single special agent to make a phone call. The agent, Adrian Hawkins, rang the DNC and was put through to the IT helpdesk. He told the tech-support contractor on duty, Yared Tamene, that a group called “the Dukes” had hacked the DNC’s computer networks. According to the paper, Tamene thought Hawkins’s message might have been a prank call. He googled “Dukes” but found nothing. He then failed to alert senior staff after his cursory search of the DNC’s computer system logs revealed no obvious sign of an intrusion. Hawkins rang back repeatedly over the next few weeks. Tamene, however, did not respond. “I did not return his calls, as I had nothing to report,” he wrote in a memo seen by the New York Times. The FBI’s laid-back approach meant that Russian hackers were able to roam inside the DNC’s computer systems for almost seven months, before Democratic officials finally realised the gravity of the attack and brought in external cybersecurity experts. In March 2016 a second Russian hacking group targeted the DNC. It sent hundreds of phishing emails, which began: “Someone just used your password to try to sign into your Google account.” One of the scam’s victims was Billy Rinehart, a former DNC regional field director, who clicked on the “change password” message while half asleep. According to the New York Times, the Obama administration was slow to respond to the hacking threat, underestimated its seriousness and fluffed several opportunities to stop it. The resulting email furore damaged Clinton’s election prospects and helped Trump to victory, as the Kremlin had almost certainly intended. After the data breach the DNC hired CrowdStrike, a cybersecurity company. It quickly established the hack had originated in Russia and identified two groups, Cozy Bear and Fancy Bear. Cozy Bear, linked to Russia’s FSB spy agency, had begun its phishing operation in summer 2015, the paper reported. Fancy Bear joined the attacks in March 2016. The hacking group is linked to the GRU, Russian military intelligence. It was Fancy Bear that hacked Podesta’s email account, the paper said. The two Kremlin hacking groups were seemingly unaware of each other, sometimes stockpiling the same stolen documents. Dmitri Alperovitch, CrowdStrike’s co-founder and chief technology officer, told the paper there was no doubt Russia was responsible. “There’s no plausible actor that has an interest in all those victims other than Russia,” he said. Additionally, the hacking groups were active at times matching Moscow’s timezone, he added.",diasaster:0},

Kiev and the four museums have been wrangling over the fate of the archaeological treasures – including gems, helmets and scabbards – which were on loan to the Allard Pierson Museum in Amsterdam when Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine in March 2014. A spokesman for Ukraine’s foreign minister, Pavlo Klimkin, tweeted: “This is an important victory for Ukraine.” There was no immediate reaction from Russian officials, but the ruling is likely to anger Moscow, which insists it has full sovereignty over the Black Sea peninsula, which houses a Russian naval base. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Jewellery was among the items included in the exhibition. Photograph: AP The annexation, following the toppling of a pro-Russia president in Kiev, triggered the biggest confrontation between the Kremlin and the west since the end of the cold war in 1991. It brought western sanctions against Moscow and complications in the international arena for Crimean organisations from sports teams and cultural institutions to commerce. Some Crimeans greeted the decision with dismay. “I don’t think it was a good idea to bring this before court,” said Valentina Mordvinsteva, a historian and the exhibition’s Crimea-based curator. “After this ruling, what should Crimean people think about Ukraine?” she said.

Photograph: AP The exhibition, its centrepiece a 4th-century BC Scythian helmet, highlighted the rich history of the peninsula, a staging post on the silk road from China to Europe, where Russian, Greek and Turkish cultures have met since ancient times. The court ruled that only sovereign countries could claim objects as cultural heritage. Since only Ukraine, not Crimea, was sovereign, it was for a Ukrainian court to adjudicate the competing ownership claims. “Ownership questions have to be settled when they have been returned to the state and in accordance with the law of the state in question,” said the judge Mieke Dudok van Heel. “The Allard Pierson Museum must return the treasures to Kiev.” A spokesman for the University of Amsterdam, owner of the Allard Pierson Museum, said the museum would continue to hold the objects until all appeals were settled. The Crimean museums have three months to appeal against the ruling. Ukraine was ordered to pay a portion of the costs of storing the collection, estimated at €300,000 (£250,000).",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Theresa May pledges to seek long-term solution to social care squeeze", "content": "Theresa May has pledged to seek a “long-term solution” to the challenge of funding social care for older people, as she confirmed that local authorities would be allowed to bring forward increases in council tax to ease the pressures on the creaking system. Social care: why are we 'beyond the crisis point'? Read more Challenged by Jeremy Corbyn on what he called the crisis in social care, May said her government would give councils more flexibility to raise more money in the short term – but would also seek a sustainable funding model. “You cannot look at this question as simply being about money in the short term. If we’re going to give people the reassurance they need in the long term, it’s about finding a way forward that will give a sustainable solution for the future,” she said. Sajid Javid, the communities secretary, is expected to announce on Thursday that local authorities will be allowed to increase council tax by up to 3% next year and the year after, with the money ringfenced to pay for social care. The maximum increase had been 2% over each of the next three years, but councils will now be able to make upfront rises of 3% in each of the next two years. Government sources were keen to stress that no further rises would be permitted – so the total increase in council tax over the three-year period would remain the same, at 6%. Pressure has been mounting on Downing Street to tackle the demands on social care, since the chancellor, Philip Hammond, triggered a Tory revolt by failing to make more funding available at his autumn statement last month. In a spirited performance at the final PMQs of 2016, Corbyn said older people were being left to live a “horrible, isolated life, when they should be cared for by all of us, through a properly funded social care system”. He urged the prime minister to cancel planned cuts to corporation tax, which were confirmed by Hammond, and ringfence the money to fund elderly care. Corbyn pointed out that increases in council tax raised more in wealthy parts of the country. “Raising council tax has a different outcome in different parts of the country,” he said, adding: “Is she saying that older people – frail, elderly, vulnerable older people – are less valuable in our cities than in other parts of the country?” May insisted money was not the only answer to the problem, pointing to what she said were poorly performing councils, singling out Ealing council as an example of poor practice for failing to integrate social care with the wider NHS. “There are also some councils across the country – some Labour councils – who have not taken that opportunity, and where we see a worse performance,” she said, pointing to a “twentyfold” difference in delayed discharges, where hospitals cannot send a patient home because there is no social care in place. “We recognise that there are indeed pressures on social care, but we also recognise that this is not just about money; it is about delivery,” she said. New research by the Nuffield Trust health thinktank shows that increasing the council tax precept for social care produces least benefit in the poorer parts of England where need is greatest. Their analysis has found that this year the local councils in the ten most affluent places in England will raise almost 50% more per head of local population from applying the 2% precept this year than those covering the ten least well-off areas. Local authorities, which are responsible for social care, have repeatedly said cuts to their funding from central government have put provision at risk. Sarah Wollaston, the Totnes MP and chair of the health select committee, called for cross-party talks to come up with a long-term solution to the problem. Hammond has also been considering whether to allow Javid to further boost social care by bringing forward to 2017-18 some of the £1.5bn the government has already pledged to put into the Better Care Fund in phased increases starting next April. That is the £4bn-a-year scheme, co-funded by the NHS and Whitehall and launched by the coalition government, to help keep older people healthier and reduce their risk of ending up in hospital. However, sources close to the Whitehall discussions about that proposal, which the Local Government Association and NHS bodies have been arguing for, said it was unlikely Javid would increase the £105m injection already planned for the fund next April. One source said: “Theresa May isn’t keen on the Better Care Fund because she sees it as just more money for the NHS through the back door and more money going into the NHS black hole, even though it’s intended to relieve the pressure on overcrowded hospitals.”",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Evacuation preparations begin after new Aleppo ceasefire deal", "content": "Preparations are under way for an evacuation of civilians and rebel fighters from east Aleppo after a new ceasefire deal was reached late on Wednesday following a day of violent bombardment and intense shuttle diplomacy. Civilians and the wounded in the eastern part of the city were expected to begin leaving the city at 6am but four hours later sources on the ground said evacuation teams had not yet crossed into the opposition enclave and there were reports of gunfire. The UN humanitarian adviser for Syria, Jan Egeland, said he was hopeful about the evacuation but that Russia had only just asked for UN involvement, which was very late. “We are now receiving information from the Russians that they would indeed want us to participate in the evacuation, but confirmation only seems to come now, this morning, which is very late, because it is already ongoing and there have already been security incidences,” Egeland told Reuters. The International Committee of the Red Cross said it had 100 volunteers and 10 ambulances waiting to go into rebel-held territory but the evacuation had not yet begun. Under the terms of the deal, confirmed by two rebel officials, a ceasefire went into effect at 2.30am local time (12.30am GMT) on Thursday. Sources in east Aleppo said shelling in the city had stopped at midnight local time but gunfire was reported on Thursday morning. The White Helmets civil defence force, which is based in east Aleppo, said one of its members was injured by a sniper while clearing an evacuation route and its ambulances had come under small arms fire. Iran hails victory in Aleppo as Shia militias boost Syria's Bashar al-Assad Read more A spokesperson for Noureddine al-Zinki, one of the armed opposition groups in Aleppo, said on Wednesday the deal to evacuate east Aleppo would also allow the evacuation of wounded people in Fua and Kefraya, two Shia villages in Idlib province that are besieged by rebels. The inclusion of Fua and Kefraya was a concession to Iran, which had opposed the previous ceasefire deal negotiated by Turkish intelligence and the Russian military. An official from Ahrar al-Sham, another key rebel group, denied, however, that Fua and Kefraya were part of the deal, which was reached after Turkish mediation. The new ceasefire agreement came a day after a previous evacuation deal appeared to unravel in the face of Iranian opposition. Tens of thousands of civilians remained trapped without food, water or medicine under a hail of artillery and airstrikes on Wednesday after Iranian-backed militia who had spearheaded the ground assault on eastern Aleppo defied a ceasefire agreement brokered on Tuesday by Russia and Turkey, which had been intended to allow residents and opposition fighters under siege to leave the city. Doctors and other civilians, who hours earlier had expressed optimism that they would be able to evacuate eastern Aleppo, again implored the international community to put a stop to the fighting that had left their homes in ruins and allow them to seek a safe haven elsewhere. “We will always remember and never forget how the criminals of the world forced Aleppo’s people to choose between two options, collective death or collective forced displacement, and we chose the lesser of the two crimes,” said one activist in a besieged opposition-held district. Rebel officials and a source with knowledge of the negotiations indicated that the original deal had been undermined by Iranian intransigence and the actions of its proxies on the ground, some of whom have been accused of carrying out execution-style shootings of civilians, had violated the ceasefire. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, and his Turkish counterpart, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, issued a joint statement on Wednesday night urging an end to the ceasefire violations and “reaffirmed their commitment to start the evacuation of civilians and the opposition through safe corridors as soon as possible”. The evacuation of fighters and civilians to Idlib province had been intended to begin on Wednesday morning, but buses intended to transport them – decorated with posters of the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad – returned to their depots empty hours later as the Iranian-backed militias refused to allow the evacuation to proceed. “Iran has prepared to invade our besieged areas and has defied Russia’s agreement,” said Yasser al-Youssef, a spokesman for the Noureddine al-Zinki rebel group. Residents said shells had also fallen on the road on which the evacuations were supposed to take place. Assad told Russia Today in an interview aired on Wednesday that western powers were seeking a ceasefire in Aleppo to stop the regime advance and save “the terrorists”. The evacuation of rebel-held eastern Aleppo would, however, mean the opposition would cede the city, the last significant urban stronghold where it maintained an active presence. Civilians left in the opposition districts have been posting farewell messages on social media as the Iranian-backed militias and forces loyal to Assad rampaged through newly reclaimed neighbourhoods in what the UN described as a “meltdown of humanity”. Many predicted they would either die once the regime’s forces reached their homes, or would be detained and tortured if they gave themselves up to them. “Save us, people. Save us, people, world, anyone who has even a bit of humanity,” said one doctor in a voice message from a besieged district. “We beg you, we beg you, the dead and wounded are in the streets and people’s homes have collapsed on top of them. Save us. Save us.” Another resident said: “We want to leave. We don’t want more massacres, let us leave. What is happening?” The UN reported on Tuesday that the Iranian-backed militias, including the Iraqi Harakat al-Nujaba, had carried out at least 82 “extrajudicial killings”, including of women and children who were living in opposition-controlled areas. Reports of detentions and forced recruitment into the Syrian army have also proliferated in recent days as the regime has advanced through former rebel territory. Residents said the bombardment on Wednesday, with artillery and airstrikes as well as alleged use of cluster bombs, had resumed at a pace greater even than before the ceasefire deal. “This is an urgent distress call,” said another doctor, who on Tuesday night had told the Guardian he was saddened to leave Aleppo but happy that civilians would survive. “Save the besieged districts of Aleppo. Since the early morning, the shelling has targeted all the besieged neighbourhoods with all types of weaponry. The dead are in the street, and so are the wounded, and there are no ambulances. Save Aleppo. An urgent distress call to every free person in the world.” Another nurse, whose father and brother were killed on the same day earlier in the regime’s offensive, pleaded that civilians be spared. “A lot of shells and bombs are falling on us, no one can walk in the streets,” he said in a voice message. “Hundreds of shells and rockets. Please let us stay alive. Please pressure the regime to keep us safe. Please, from Aleppo, the last call.” As a White Helmet I ask for one thing: safe passage for those in Aleppo | Raed Al Saleh Read more He added: “The medical situation is so bad. No ambulances, no cars, it’s a very horrible situation in our neighbourhoods. Please let our scream arrive to the whole world.” Weeks of immense suffering and violence in eastern Aleppo since the Syrian regime and its allies began a final push into territory that had been in rebel hands since 2012 have left residents in total despair and increasingly angry at the international community for abandoning them to their fates. The US ambassador to the United Nations, Samantha Power, told the security council late on Tuesday that the Syrian government, along with Russia and Iran, bore responsibility for the deaths of civilians in Aleppo. She accused the three states of putting a noose around civilians in the city, asking: “Are you incapable of shame? … Is there no execution of a child that gets under your skin? Is there literally nothing that shames you?”",diasaster:0},

{ "title":"Public funding for arts still skewed towards London, report says", "content": "Too high a proportion of public funding is still going to London-based arts organisations and museums, which are in a far better position to increase revenue from other sources, a group of MPs has said. A report published on Thursday by the DCMS (Department for Culture, Media and Sport) select committee examines support for the arts outside the capital and while it welcomes signs of a shift towards the regions, it says more could be done. Arts Council England (ACE) is distributing a lower proportion of lottery money to the capital – 40% in 2014 and due to be 25% in 2018 – and it announced spending plans for 2018-22 that include an additional £37m to increase the proportion of spending outside the capital. But it still gives nearly half of its current £1bn grant in aid to London. The report says: “While we welcome the fact that lottery funding is increasingly spent outside London, we remain concerned that 42% grant in aid currently goes to London.” MPs do not set a figure, but say the current spending is disproportionate and call for a “better regional balance”, particularly because cultural organisations in London have more opportunities to increase alternative revenue streams – with sponsorship and philanthropy – than those in the regions. The call comes against a backdrop of falling local authority spending on arts and museums, with a survey last year estimating that one in five regional museums has either closed or will close. The report gives examples of spending cuts: • In Lancashire five museums have been threatened with closure after council funding went from £1.3m to £98,000 a year. In West Yorkshire Dewsbury Museum closed recently, even though it was renovated in 2010 • In Derby there is nowhere for orchestras to perform because funding for the concert hall was withdrawn • In the West Midlands there has been a 51% cut in spending on local authority-owned historic buildings and a 32% cut to conservation planning policy • The Independent Street Arts Network told the committee that local authority-funded festivals, such as Chelmsford City Diversions, were disappearing There should be a greater appreciation of the cultural treasures and creative innovation to be found across the UK Damian Collins Evidence suggests that the biggest impact of cuts is likely to fall “where the cultural offering is already weak, with the result that those with most to gain from cultural investment will lose out.” Damian Collins, the chair of the committee, said “innovation, partnerships and increased financial incentives” were vital to promoting arts and culture outside London and the trend for spending more in the regions needed to continue. He added: “There should be a greater appreciation of the cultural treasures and creative innovation to be found across the UK, and especially outside of London. “Strong local leadership and innovation from regional arts and cultural organisations has produced some remarkable successes, but more needs to be done to avoid further closures of small museums and galleries, as funding from local authorities declines.” The report recommends action from a number of bodies. The government, it says, should consider how to incentivise greater corporate sponsorship and regional philanthropy, and also consider expanding existing tax breaks for the cultural sector and simplifying Gift Aid. Grants to all institutions funded by the DCMS as well as important partner museums and the 663 National Portfolio Organisations funded by ACE should come with a condition – that they have to share with local organisations best practice around raising money. Collins said all national and big organisations should have partnership programmes. “It should be a normal thing as part of receiving grant funding.” Many local authorities have and are considering cutting the arts. But the report says some are not, and gives examples of good practice. There are examples of smaller organisations being impressively ambitious. For example, Bury Art Museum coordinated a tour of British art in China, generating revenue of about £100,000. An example of innovative fundraising includes a “pay what you think it is worth” scheme at Glossop music festival. Some organisations make sure they are aligned with wider economic strategies. For example, a big exhibition of contemporary Chinese art at the Whitworth in Manchester was staged to coincide with the launch of direct flights between Manchester and China. Investing in arts brings tangible benefits, the report says, highlighting Turner Contemporary in Margate, which opened in 2011 and has led to an extra 2m visits to the town, 48% of them specifically to visit the gallery. The Countries of Culture report also calls for greater national coordination of lending and touring and says there is a strong case for a new national body to take charge of it. The committee’s report, which involved six evidence sessions and more than 100 submissions, is a follow-up to one in the last parliament that also highlighted an imbalance in London versus regions arts spending. The report was welcomed by ACE’s chief executive, Darren Henley, who said it recognised “the progress we are making in shifting investment outside London, on diversifying income streams, and ensuring more people benefit from our investment”. He added: “The coming year will see continued pressure on local authority funding for culture and it is good to see these challenges acknowledged. We will continue to work closely with local partners to forge new relationships and ways of delivering arts and culture across the country.”",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"'Eat mutton': Indian newspaper's 'scientific' tips for conceiving boys", "content": "A south Indian newspaper has offered its readers “scientifically proven” advice on how to conceive a boy, including eating plenty of mutton, never skipping breakfast and always sleeping with your face turned leftwards. The advice, which ran on Tuesday in the Kerala newspaper Mangalam, highlights the deep-rooted and often deadly preference for male children that persists in Indian culture. India's missing girls: fears grow over rising levels of foeticide | KumKum Dasgupta Read more Admitting its methods might not be guaranteed to work, the column suggested that women looking to conceive boys needed to ensure they never missed breakfast, and ate much more than their normal intake throughout the day. Mutton and dry grapes were the best food for women, while men needed to avoid eating food with high acid content, it said. It also advised readers to attempt procreation on only the first, third, fifth or seventh days of the week, when sperm were “scientifically” shown to be stronger. The column was translated from Malayalam by the Indian feminist website the Ladies Finger, which “recommended” the advice to its readers, “especially if, God forbid, the blood moon sacrifices conducted by your extended family for a male heir haven’t worked out yet”. A preference for boys is deeply ingrained in many of India’s cultures, and tens of thousands of girls are thought to be aborted each year. The result is a heavily distorted gender ratio, with India’s most recent census finding there were 940 girls born each year for every 1,000 boys. The disparity is worst in Haryana, a state in the country’s north, where just 830 girls are born for every 1,000 boys. Ranjana Kumari, a leading activist in the movement against female foeticide, said efforts were under way in five Haryana districts to change community attitudes about the economic potential of women, which she said was the most potent way of dissuading people from aborting female foetuses. “What works best is changing the image of girls in our society. Showing that girls can be educated, employed, take care of their families,” she said. Kumari said Kerala was one of India’s most progressive and educated states, so it was surprising that they were “tolerating such stupid, unscientific lies” as those published in Mangalam. The Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, has been vocal about the need to end the practice, comparing foeticide to Ravana, a demon king from Hindu scripture whose effigy is ceremonially burned each year. In a speech this year to mark the ceremony, he ranked sex-selection alongside terrorism, caste discrimination, religious hatred and corruption as the main “evils” in Indian society.",diasaster:0},

But the number of people of working age considered “economically inactive” – out of work and neither seeking nor available to work – jumped by 76,000 over the period to 8.9 million. Employment graphic Damian Green, the work and pensions secretary, highlighted the fact that the jobless rate remained at the lowest in more than a decade. He added: “This year will be remembered as one when so many records were made – employment has consistently been running at an all-time high with more women, older workers and ethnic minority groups in work than ever before. “But there is more to do to help people of all backgrounds and abilities into work, which will remain a priority as we press ahead with our welfare reforms that are ensuring it always pays to be in work.” But the ONS said its figures suggested the UK employment market was softening. David Freeman, a senior statistician, said: “The labour market appears to have flattened off in recent months. While the employment rate remains high, it is slightly down on the record set recently. Meanwhile, a small fall in unemployment on the quarter was more than offset by a rise in economic inactivity.” Economists including those at the Bank of England have warned that 2017 would be tougher for UK workers and consumers. Unemployment is expected to rise as the broader economy slows and businesses grapple with higher costs and waning demand. Commenting on the latest ONS figures, Suren Thiru, the head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce, said: “It is likely that UK unemployment will start to drift upwards in the coming months, as uncertainty over Brexit and the increasing input costs faced by businesses weigh on jobs growth. However, while we currently forecast the unemployment rate will peak at 5.5% in early 2018, this is still well below the long-term average.” Higher inflation is expected to squeeze household finances at a time of weak wage growth. Inflation data published on Tuesday showed the headline annual rate rose to 1.2% in November from 0.9% in October. It was the highest level in more than two years, driven higher by clothing and petrol prices, in a sign that the fall in the value of the pound since the Brexit vote is fuelling a rise in the cost of living. Inflation is expected to rise sharply in 2017, to about 3%, further squeezing household finances. UK workers are only just recovering from a prolonged period of falling real pay during the financial crisis, when inflation was higher than wages growth for six straight years. Rachel Smith, the CBI’s principal labour market adviser, said: “We see a mixed picture from the labour market over the last three months, with employment levels remaining more or less the same and unemployment seeing a slight drop. “Although wage growth has gone up somewhat, so has inflation, hitting workers’ pay packets in real terms. Boosting productivity in every region and nation of the UK will be essential if firms are to further raise wages sustainably for their employees.”",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Gerald Finley/Antonio Pappano review – warmth, wit and spirit", "content": "As Gerald Finley explained, with a Canadian bass-baritone of Scottish extraction and a pianist with Italian parents who was born in London but moved to the US when he was 13, the possibility of mixing national traditions was almost inevitable. And in fact, such blending proved highly rewarding. Finley exploited his vigorous, tensile tone in a Beethoven group including Italian as well as German settings, bringing an almost operatic subjectivity to Liszt’s Three Petrarch Sonnets, heard here in the composer’s own late version for baritone voice, and also allowing Antonio Pappano to revel in his virtuoso technique. Both artists brought tonal warmth and spirit to Respighi’s Four Scottish Airs – clever settings whose wit and folksy charm makes their rarity scarcely explicable. Subtler colours were summoned up in a Ravel group, featuring another Scottish song, a Greek song sung in French, a French song in the patois of the Limousin region, and an Italian song – in Italian. In these and the following Shostakovich cycle, the unity of approach between singer and pianist was nigh on immaculate, each capturing the striking contrasts of mood – sombre, bitter, comic-grotesque – traversed by the Russian composer in his Six Romances on Verses by English Poets (some of them, in fact, Scottish). A closing group of songs and ballads by Tosti – singing teacher to Queen Victoria’s family – was delivered with imaginative artistry that highlighted the genuine quality of some frequently underrated material.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"US travel ban leaves Iranian LGBT refugees in limbo", "content": "Gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender refugees from Iran have found themselves caught between a rock and a hard place after Donald Trump’s executive order banning entry for people from seven Muslim-majority countries. US travel ban puts 20,000 refugees in 'precarious circumstances', UN says Read more The order also suspended the US refugee admissions system for 120 days, and promised to prioritise members of religious minorities. But it made no mention of people facing persecution for their sexual orientation, and several gay Iranians who have fled a country where homosexuality is punishable by death are now left stuck in Turkey, where they say they are experiencing worse homophobic abuses than in their homeland. Some of the refugees have already had their asylum applications approved by the UN refugee agency and were due to be resettled in the US after months or even years of interviews and security checks. Mitra, a 27-year-old lesbian living in Denizli, a conservative city in south-west Turkey, left Iran in 2014 after receiving death threats because of her activities as the editor of Aghaliat, an online magazine focusing on LGBT issues. She was granted refugee status by the UN nearly two years ago, and was due to attend her final interview this month before being resettled in the US. “They have just called me and said it’s all cancelled,” she said. Until Trump’s ban came into force, the US was the only viable path to safety for gay Iranians who end up in Turkey. Canada no longer accepts them because it is focusing on Syrian refugees. European countries do not normally accept LGBT Iranians who have applied from Turkey. Like many of her fellow minorities, Mitra was initially approved to go to Canada. “I waited for 14 months, [and] even went through the medical checks but one day they called and said Canada doesn’t accept Iranians anymore and I should go to the US. Now that’s up in the air too.” Mitra added: “One by one all my dreams and hopes are being destroyed before my eyes. It doesn’t matter to me whether to go to Canada or the US, I just want to go somewhere – anywhere – safe.” Mitra currently lives with her partner in a tiny room with one sofa that is also their bed. “Iran doesn’t want us, Canada doesn’t want us and now the US doesn’t want us either. I have seen the suicide of three friends since 2015. A gay Iranian [threw] himself off a balcony and an Iranian lesbian hanged herself just eight months ago.” She argued that the US should also make exemptions for sexual minorities as well. “At least with religious refugees, they have the support of their families, we don’t even have that. Our families are [ashamed] of us.” Javad, 50, is a disabled Iranian gay man also living in Turkey. “I was abandoned by my family, I was abandoned by my country and now I [do not] have anywhere to go,” he said. He said two of his friends were beaten up in the street. “One day a friend of mine, an Iranian gay name Pouya, called and said, ‘forgive me’,” he said. “I realised he was about to take his life. “I am disabled, I struggled to get to his house, by the time I got there he had died. He had just had enough.” Saghi Ghahraman, the head of the Canada-based Iranian Queer Organisation, said LGBT Iranians face horrific punishment and bullying. A fatwa issued in 1987 by the late Ayatollah Khomeini legalised transexuality, but social stigma remains still rampant, and homosexuality is still punishable by death. “Up until 2013, the wait-time for the LGBT to be determined and resettled by the [UN high commissioner for refugees] in Turkey was about a year and a half, which was barely manageable,” she said. “But it changed with the war in Syria, and when the USA and Canada undertook resettlement of large number of displaced Syrians, the LGBT wait-time before resettlement went up to three years,” she said. Meanwhile, gay Iranian exiles have been subjected to a string of violent hate attacks and murders in Turkey, said Ghahraman. The 26-year-old Azad, a gay Iranian who was approved for relocation by the UN 23 months ago, said his friend fainted in the bus when he heard about Trump’s decision. “We’re stuck, we can’t go forward, we can’t go backward,” he said. “Turkey is so unstable too these days and anything can happen, what if they deport us back to Iran?”",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"UK house price growth has hit 14-month low, says Nationwide", "content": "UK house prices grew at their weakest annual rate in more than a year in January, in an early sign of the property market slowdown predicted for 2017. Annual growth edged down from 4.5% in December to 4.3%, according to the mortgage lender Nationwide. It was the weakest since November 2015. On a monthly basis, the average price of a UK home edged up 0.2%, to £205,240, following a 0.8% rise in December. Robert Gardner, Nationwide’s chief economist, said there were indications the housing market would soften in 2017, as household budgets come under pressure from higher consumer inflation at a time of weaker jobs and wage growth. UK housing market falters as estate agents become less optimistic Read more “The outlook for the housing market remains clouded, reflecting the uncertainty surrounding economic prospects more broadly,” Gardner said. “On the one hand, there are grounds for optimism. The economy has remained far stronger than expected in the wake of the Brexit vote. However, there are tentative signs that conditions may be about to soften. “The economy is likely to slow through 2017 as the squeeze on household budgets intensifies and heightened uncertainty weighs on business investment and hiring.” Nationwide predicts that growth in house prices will more than halve in 2017 to 2% from 4.5% in 2016. Howard Archer, the chief UK economist at IHS Markit, said conditions for house buyers were likely to deteriorate progressively during 2017. Inflation has already started to rise as the impact of the sharp fall in the value of the pound since the EU referendum feeds through to prices. A weaker pound makes imports from abroad more expensive. The headline rate UK inflation jumped to a two-and-a-half-year high of 1.6% in December from 1.2% in November, and is expected to rise to about 3% in the coming months. Looking back at trends over the last 60 years, Nationwide said the biggest gains in real house prices – comparing how much faster house prices have increased compared with goods and services more generally – were made in the 2000s. “These increases were spurred by a combination of strong and stable economic growth, a structural decline in interest rates and the further liberalisation of the financial system,” Gardner said. “In the decades ahead, real house price trends will continue to depend crucially on developments in the wider economy, though there is an even greater degree of uncertainty around this than usual.”",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Protesters in Romania denounce plan to decriminalise misconduct offences", "content": "Tens of thousands of people have taken to the streets in Romania to protest against an emergency ordinance passed on Tuesday night that decriminalises some offences, including official misconduct in cases where the financial damage is less than 200,000 lei (£38,000). Critics of the ordinance, introduced by a government that won parliamentary elections in December, say it could reverse an anti-corruption fight in Romania that has drawn widespread praise internationally. Additional laws could be issued in the coming days, further eroding ministers’ accountability, according to the government’s opponents. In a post on Facebook, the Romanian president, Klaus Iohannis, who has opposed the emergency ordinance and who last month joined protesters on the streets, wrote: “Today is a day of mourning for the rule of law.” News of the ordinance passing broke at about 10pm local time, and by midnight local media estimated that 12,000 people were demonstrating in Bucharest and 10,000 in other cities across the country, despite freezing temperatures. There were shouts of “Thieves” and “You won’t get away with it.” “I don’t normally protest but I just felt such a sense of rage,” said Alexandra Boeriu, a 35-year-old NGO worker who protested outside the main government building in Bucharest. “I was young, but I did live through communism and I know what this is. I don’t want this for my kids. There are a lot of people protesting who want to have a future in this country. It feels like someone has died.” Facebook Twitter Pinterest Klaus Iohannis: ‘Today is a day of mourning for the rule of law.’ Photograph: Patrick Seeger/EPA “You can’t just publish laws in the night and say shut up, we won the election, you have no rights,” said Dragos Stanca, 42, a digital media entrepreneur who was also demonstrating. “It’s a very dangerous precedent. If this is the kind of procedure they do, we wonder what’s next. It looks like anything is possible.” Protests have been held for the past two Sundays over the government’s plans, which would also grant amnesty to those sentenced to jail terms shorter than five years in relation to certain crimes and halve prison terms for those with young children, pregnant women, or those over 60. The EU has weighed in on the controversy, warning the government not to backtrack on anti-graft measures. “The fight against corruption needs to be advanced, not undone,” European commission head Jean-Claude Juncker and his deputy, Frans Timmermans, said in a joint statement. “We are following the latest developments in Romania with great concern.” Government officials have suggested the laws were aimed at easing overcrowded conditions in prisons, but few observers are convinced, and many believe the real purpose is to help convicted politicians, or those who are now under investigation, escape justice. Romania, an enthusiastic EU member for a decade and a major recipient of EU funds, remains one of Europe’s most corrupt countries: a report by the IPP thinktank released late last year found that of the 588 MPs elected in previous elections in 2012, 89 – or 15% – were either under investigation for graft, had already been convicted, or chose to step down for other positions. Hundreds of officials have been imprisoned in recent years, and more than 2,000 files are under investigation in relation to abuse of office, according to prosecutors. “With this government I feel insecure and the new law which favours corruption is a huge offence and an attack on us, the regular people,” said Alberto Grosescu, a 29-year-old photographer who took to the streets on Tuesday night immediately after the ordinance was announced. Grosescu predicts that many more people will come out to protest. “I’m pretty sure that tonight there is going to be over 100,000 people in Bucharest, maybe over 200,000 across the whole country,” he said. Those protesting hope that their actions could still lead to change. “They have to, I don’t think politicians can ignore so many people, but we have to stand up and continue to stand up,” said Boeriu. Thousands of people gathered outside the main government building in Bucharest on Wednesday morning. It is thought that protests later in the day could be the biggest since the fall of communism in 1989.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Who is Neil Gorsuch? A staunch conservative with a background to worry liberals", "content": "In a 2005 essay titled Liberals ’N’ Lawsuits, Neil Gorsuch, then a corporate lawyer in Washington, DC, argued that “American liberals” had come to rely too much on court decisions to advance “their social agenda on everything from gay marriage to assisted suicide to the use of vouchers for private-school education”. Published just months after the re-election of George W Bush, it was a remarkable bit of concern-trolling ahead of its time. If liberals really wanted to enact their agenda, Gorsuch wrote, they should focus on “trying to win elections rather than lawsuits”. Neil Gorsuch nominated by Trump to fill supreme court vacancy Read more Fast-forward 12 years. American liberals – and quite a few centrists too – have lost another election and many have once again turned their eyes to the courts, hoping for protection from what looks to many of them like a vicious attack by the executive branch on core rights and freedoms. If Donald Trump has his way Gorsuch will be in a position this time to do more than just write an essay. If confirmed by the Senate as the newest justice on the US supreme court, he will have unique power to help vindicate or frustrate liberals’ strategy. The announcement of Gorsuch’s nomination in a hyped White House spectacle on Tuesday night was greeted with expressions of concern on the left and robust cheer on the right. Carrie Severino, chief counsel of the conservative Judicial Crisis Network, hailed Gorsuch as a “principled constitutionalist” with “an obviously brilliant legal mind”. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Trump picks Neil Gorsuch for US supreme court “He is someone who is going to look at any question according to what the constitution itself says, setting aside his own political views” whatever they may be, Severino said. A partisan scrum has developed around the nomination nevertheless, with Democrats vowing a filibuster and the Republican senate leadership vowing a confirmation. The air of partisan controversy is not obviously rooted in Gorsuch’s track record as a circuit court judge, which does not include rulings on the kinds of hot-button social issues he alluded to in his Bush-era essay. Gorsuch’s disposition on abortion rights cases may be suggested in a line from a book he wrote about euthanasia, the subject of his doctoral studies at Oxford University. “To act intentionally against life is to suggest that its value rests only on its transient instrumental usefulness for other ends,” Gorsuch wrote. Nancy Northup, president and CEO of the Center for Reproductive Rights, said the onus was on the nominee to explain his position on the issue. “Given president Trump’s promise to appoint a supreme court justice that would seek to overturn Roe v Wade, we need to know whether Judge Gorsuch would do just that,” Northup said. The looming issues awaiting Donald Trump's supreme court nominee Read more “Our constitution guarantees a woman’s right to safe, legal abortion. Any effort to gut those protections would harm the rights and health of women for generations to come.” But beyond any single issue Gorsuch has articulated a judicial philosophy that emphasizes the primacy of the constitution and prizes the text of laws, while warning against judicial forays that might be mistaken for an attempt to shape or direct legislation. “Congress could have written the law differently than it did, and it is always free to rewrite the law when it wishes,” Gorsuch wrote in a ruling that argued for a new hearing for a felon convicted of firearm possession. “But in our legal order it is the role of the courts to apply the law as it is written, not some different law Congress might have written in the past or might write in the future.” In some ways Gorsuch seems likely to please social conservatives. He has repeatedly upheld claims of a religious exemption where the law would compel an individual to violate a personal spiritual belief. While the supreme court declined to consider one such “religious liberty” case in 2016, in which a family-owned pharmacy objected to a state regulation forcing it to sell emergency contraceptives, future cases in the area seem likely. In Hobby Lobby Stores Inc v Sebelius, Gorsuch argued that a retail store owner need not comply with a provision in Barack Obama’s health care law requiring employers to provide health insurance covering oral contraceptives. In his opinion Gorsuch gave wide berth to the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which asserts the religious liberty claim and which Gorsuch called a “super-statute”. Hannah Smith, a lawyer at the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, which represented Hobby Lobby in the case, praised the judge’s ruling. “That opinion is an example that he is a clear thinker, a clear writer on really complicated religious liberty issues,” Smith told the Guardian. “They were faced with a Hobson’s choice, to choose to abide by their religion or saving their business. I think he’s someone who would stand up for the religious liberty for all.” Elsewhere Gorsuch has ruled sympathetically in cases involving the erection of Ten Commandments monuments in public spaces and ruled against capital punishment defendants seeking relief from their sentences. In the integrity of his adherence to the principal of judicial restraint, as well as in the pithy eloquence – if he lacks a certain acerbity – of his opinions, Gorsuch is often compared favorably with the justice he would replace, Antonin Scalia, who died in February 2016. “His writing style has often been compared to Justice Scalia’s,” Severino said. “It’s very incisive, very clear and logical, but also very entertaining, and of course that was a hallmark of Justice Scalia’s own writing style.” Gorsuch spoke about Scalia’s death in an April 2016 speech at Case Western University. “I was taking a breather in the middle of a ski run with little on my mind but the next mogul field when my phone rang with the news,” Gorsuch said. “I immediately lost what breath I had left, and I am not embarrassed to admit that I couldn’t see the rest of the way down the mountain for the tears. He really was a lion of the law: docile in private life but a ferocious fighter when at work, with a roar that could echo for miles.” Gorsuch’s biggest difference with Scalia comes in the field of administrative law, an area that is sleepy for most laypeople but determines the scope of much government action. The Trump nominee has been a critic of “Chevron deference,” a doctrine that gives administrative agencies significant latitude with how they interpret federal statutes. His views, which are shared by a number of conservative legal scholars, would significantly weaken the federal government and allow the courts to override agency actions on issues ranging from immigration to health care to the environment. But several former colleagues of Gorsuch’s from across the ideological spectrum have called for Gorsuch’s confirmation, saying his temperament is distinctly different from Scalia. “Scalia’s writing seemed dismissive to the claims of gay rights,” said Melissa Hart, professor at the University of Colorado Law School who worked with Gorsuch. “Everything I know about Neil Gorsuch as a person leads me to believe he would not be dismissive of anyone’s claims, regardless of how he rules. I’m not saying I think he will rule in favor of LGBT rights but I don’t think he will be dismissive of anyone’s claims.” Hart said she believes Gorsuch is “more than qualified to be on the supreme court”, echoing an op-ed in the New York Times by Neal Katyal, a former acting solicitor general under Barack Obama, that called for liberals to back Gorsuch. “I understand the political reasons for wanting to block the nomination,” Hart said, “but I don’t think there’s a principled reason to reject Neil Gorsuch as a jurist.” Neil McGill Gorsuch was born on 29 August 1967 and grew up in Denver, Colorado. His family moved to Washington, DC, after Ronald Reagan nominated his mother, Anne Gorsuch Burford, to head the Environmental Protection Agency. Gorsuch attended Georgetown preparatory school, Columbia University, Harvard Law school and Oxford University, where he enrolled on a Marshall scholarship and earned a doctorate. He fits the mold of every sitting justice on the US supreme court in educational pedigree: they all went to Harvard or Yale for law school. Post-graduation, Gorsuch worked for a decade representing mostly corporate clients at the Washington law firm of Kellogg Huber Hansen Todd Evans & Figel. But Mark Hansen, the nominee’s former boss at the firm, told the Denver Post that Gorsuch was a “regular person”. “He acts and relates well to all people, and he did the same sort of thing in trial, where he was very good at making connections with jurors,” Hansen said. “He’s a regular person. It’s part of being a Westerner.” At Oxford, Gorsuch met his future wife, Louise Gorsuch, a UK citizen. With their two teenage daughters they lives outside Boulder, Colorado, where Gorsuch indulges hobbies including fly-fishing, hiking and rowing. After his 2005 essay subtly celebrating the re-election of George W Bush, Gorsuch got good news from the administration. Gorsuch was to be appointed to the 10th circuit appeals court, which covers all or part of Colorado, Kansas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Utah and Wyoming. In 2006, when it came time for the Senate to review his nomination, Gorsuch was confirmed in the most expeditious way possible, by a voice vote and encountering no objection. This time may be different. With reporting by Ben Jacobs",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"The Guardian view on Brexit: more haste, less speed", "content": "In the end, 47 Labour MPs decided to vote against the bill triggering article 50. Two more frontbenchers, Dawn Butler and Rachel Maskell, resigned in order to vote against Jeremy Corbyn’s ill-advised three-line whip. Many MPs, in two days of often deeply felt debate, said they felt bound to honour their voters’ wishes despite their belief that leaving the EU will be a disaster for the economy, and regardless of the majority for remain among people who would normally vote Labour. The difficulty of this vote for the party was etched on the face of the shadow Brexit secretary, Sir Keir Starmer, as he wove his way through the mess of conflicting ambitions that constitute current party policy. We would rather that the party had voted with its heart than, as it perhaps did, with an eye on its electoral prospects in leave areas like Stoke and Copeland. We would say the same about the Conservative remainers too. But Labour’s equivocations on Europe long predated the vote and will continue long after. Yet unless it can find a stronger position to unite around on such a central issue, Labour will struggle to be a credible party of opposition. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Brexit debate: the best Commons speeches, from Ken Clarke to Nick Clegg But Labour’s dismal performance is not the real scandal of Wednesday’s vote, and those who pretend it is are playing the leavers’ game. The real scandal is that, with the distinguished exception of Ken Clarke, the Tory party’s many remainers bent the knee. As a result, the government had an overwhelming majority on the second reading of the bill to trigger article 50. Its failure to publish a white paper before the debate went unpunished. This disregard for the most basic of requirements for a decision of such consequence must not be allowed to be a taste of things to come. It is all the more alarming that, as late as Tuesday, it seems no draft had been circulated: the home secretary, a member of the small group of senior ministers who sit on the cabinet committee on Brexit, told MPs she had not seen it. Yet, even as the potentially grim consequences of Brexit become clearer, Theresa May’s timetable for the process of departure remains on track. It is not all over, however. Everything is still possible. Now the prime minister must come clean about the choices that lie ahead, and their consequences – and she must convey to the whole of Britain the scale of the task ahead. Even without a white paper, it is clear that she puts controlling borders and repatriating law at the head of her list of priorities. It is also clear, as George Osborne told the Commons, that at the head of the EU’s list is the integrity of the union of the remaining 27 members. Those governing ideas will, unavoidably, make many of the other ambitions that Mrs May set out in her speech a fortnight ago extremely challenging. The negotiations will be just that – negotiations that must be conducted with the intention of reaching an agreement that is acceptable for both sides. It is an irony that Mrs May will not appreciate that the European court of justice from which she so ardently wishes to escape is highly likely to be called in to adjudicate on aspects of the final deal, as its president Koen Lenaerts points out. Mrs May talks ominously about no deal being better than a bad deal, and claims to be prepared to crash out on World Trade Organisation terms. This is a terrible strategy. As the SNP’s Westminster leader, Angus Robertson, put it at prime minister’s questions, Mrs May has made one successful foreign trip in the past week. That was her trip to Dublin, where she and the Irish taoiseach, Enda Kenny, discussed how best to preserve the free trade area and protect the Northern Ireland peace process. She would do well to take the lesson about the value of negotiations conducted in good faith and a spirit of cooperation. A hard Brexit would be ruinous. Every MP should spend the coming week consulting their local businesses on the impact of WTO terms, and calculate their likely impact on jobs and prices. The referendum itself has been a catastrophe. But if Mrs May continues to treat leaving the EU as if it can be achieved in a couple of years of hard work, she is doing the voters a grave disservice. She knows the cost of making pledges on immigration that are unachievable. Suggesting that Brexit can be done and dusted before the next election is a deceit on a monstrous scale. As Sir Ivan Rogers, the former UK ambassador to the EU, told MPs on the Brexit committee on Wednesday morning, the task ahead was “humongous”. It would, unavoidably, be bloody. This will be a long game, and the government must say so.",diasaster:0},

The father, who cannot be named to protect his daughter’s identity, said she was separated from her family and friends over the festive period and was not able to exchange Christmas presents with him after being identified by Twitter trolls. She worked over Christmas to take her mind off her tormentors, who are supporters of Evans, her father said. The Welsh former Sheffield United striker was jailed in April 2012 for raping the woman in a hotel room in Rhyl, north Wales. He denied rape, claiming the sex was consensual, but he was found guilty by a jury at Caernarfon crown court. After his release in October, Evans posted a video on his website protesting his innocence and vowing to clear his name. In the video, in which he sits arm in arm with his girlfriend Natasha Massey, he said his “act of infidelity” had been “an incredibly foolish decision”, but he was “determined to continue the fight to clear my name”. Speaking to the Mail on Sunday, the victim’s father said: “It’s the fifth time she’s had to move in under three years, she is just living her life on the run. “I couldn’t even see her over Christmas because it’s too risky for her to visit me. I don’t even know where she is living at the moment, so I haven’t been able to give her the Christmas presents I bought her. “The last time I saw her was almost a year ago, and it’s been hard not having her at home over Christmas. I just want her near me so I can protect her.” Evans has been searching for new employment since his release from jail, but attempts to get his football career back on track – with clubs including Sheffield United and Hartlepool United – have triggered public backlashes.

{ "title":"Tesco may have to find £300m a year to plug pensions hole", "content": "Tesco, the embattled supermarket chain that lived through a nightmare two years, is facing additional financial pressure in 2015 when it must publish plans to plug a £3bn hole in its multibillion-pound pension scheme. The company is confronting the prospect of injecting an extra £300m into its employees’ retirement fund every year for the next 10 years, according to independent pensions consultant John Ralfe. Meeting this heavy commitment is yet another challenge for newly appointed chief executive Dave Lewis, who is tasked with returning the UK’s leading grocery business to its former glories. Ralfe, a former head of corporate finance at the chemist chain Boots who made his name handling its £2.3bn pension fund, said: “2014 saw Tesco firing its chief executive [Philip Clarke in July], disclosing accounting irregularities [which are being investigated by the Serious Fraud Office], mothballing newly completed stores, and facing a challenge to its whole business model from the discounters, such as Aldi and Lidl. Increased cash contributions to plug its pension fund is yet another problem. “The new finance director [Alan Stewart] will want to make sure shareholders have absolute confidence in all of the numbers, including pensions, which Tesco produces.” Tesco said it could not comment in detail on its pension deficit as the size of the shortfall in its employees’ pension fund is being assessed, via a triennial actuarial valuation which the company said it expected to be concluded before the end of May. The size of the gap, along with a plan to fill it, must be published by June and the group’s last annual report suggested the deficit is almost £3.2bn – the difference between the fund’s £8.1bn of assets and its £11.3bn of liabilities. The pensions regulator typically allows companies and trustees to devise strategies spanning 10 years to correct deficits, though in practice businesses often seek to correct issues over 15 years. Ralfe said he expected the actuarial valuation deficit announced next year to be similar to the figure produced in the company’s 2014 accounts. Tesco said its last triennial trustee’s actuarial valuation, from March 2011, showed a deficit of £934m. Its 2011 annual report, taking in figures up to the end of February 2011, showed a pension deficit of £1.4bn. The retailer has sought to correct the funding problems and in its 2013 financial year made an additional injection of £180m, on top of other routine contributions designed to reduce the deficit on the scheme. The one-off top-up dropped to £4m in 2014. Tesco declined to explain the marked difference between the two figures.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Tony Fernandes, the millionaire entrepreneur behind AirAsia", "content": "A childhood dream, a little mentoring from Richard Branson and a 20p purchase took Malaysian entrepreneur Tony Fernandes to the helm of the pan-Asian budget airline at the heart of aviation’s latest mystery. Born in Kuala Lumpur in 1964, Fernandes went to boarding school in Epsom, Surrey, before going on to study at the London School of Economics. He followed Branson’s own trajectory of beginning in the music industry, working for Virgin after graduation. In 2001, aged 37, he made his move into airlines by snapping up AirAsia, then a troubled, state-owned airline that had run up large debts, for one ringgit, or around 20p. According to Forbes magazine, he now has an estimated personal wealth of around £400m. He was made a CBE in 2011. The branding of Fernandes’s airline felt like Branson’s Virgin, down to the colour scheme and logo typeface, but the bigger inspiration was the boom in low-cost flying that was transforming Europe’s flightmaps. Soon the fleet was expanding rapidly, and within a decade AirAsia was flying 30 million passengers annually. While the group’s HQ is in Malaysia, the AirAsia brand has become an umbrella for foreign airlines in which Fernandes has a stake. He bought 49% of the then AWAIR, an Indonesian low-cost carrier, in 2004, rebranding it as Indonesia AirAsia the following year. Similar joint ventures have brought AirAsia into the Philippines, Thailand, Japan and most recently into India. With large numbers of new planes on order, Fernandes has spoken of AirAsia X linking Europe and Asia via low-cost longhaul in the years ahead, starting with a London route. For all his entrepreneurial nous, Fernandes has made questionable ventures in other arenas – in Britain, most famously buying up football club QPR and seeing it overreach itself in terms of salaries for star players who failed to deliver. A four-year adventure in Formula One came to an unhappy conclusion early in 2014. A well-recognised face in Asia, where he has taken the Alan Sugar role in the continent’s version of The Apprentice, he is not averse to immersing himself in publicity stunts of all sorts à la Branson – in fact, a bet between the two tycoons recently led to the Virgin boss dressed up as a stewardess serving passengers on AirAsia flights. Fernandes is prolific on social media and was quick to share condolences and keep the public informed as he made his way to Surabaya in Indonesia to meet relatives of the passengers aboard flight QZ8501. “This is my worse nightmare,” he wrote on Twitter. “But there is no stopping. To all my staff Airasia all stars be strong, continue to be the best. Pray hard. Continue to do your best for all our guests. See u all soon.”",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Ofgem energy league table could save users hundreds of pounds", "content": "Ofgem has published its first energy company league table, comparing the most expensive standard tariffs with the cheapest deals on the market to provide “greater transparency to consumers”. The energy secretary, Greg Clark, said the table would show consumers where they could save money and would increase transparency for the “millions” of Britons who were overpaying for their gas and electricity by remaining on the expensive standard variable tariffs. The table will compare the average energy bill paid by a household on a standard variable tariff from the larger energy companies with deals from the 10 cheapest suppliers. Consumers can typically save £200 a year; this figure could be as much as £260 for those with the supplier Extra Energy. Energy customers advised… don’t run up a big credit balance Read more The energy regulator said last month that 66% of all households remained on expensive standard variable tariffs. The government is also launching a call for evidence on allowing customers access to accurate electronic data on how much energy they use to enable them to share it securely with price comparison websites in return for individual quotes. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) warned in June that 70% of people were on the more expensive “default” standard variable tariff, costing consumers £1.4 bn more than a competitive market. Clark said: “Millions of people across Britain continue to pay too much for their energy. The measures announced today are a positive step to help more people benefit from increased choice and competition. “As the government has made clear, where markets are not working for consumers – in energy or otherwise – we are prepared to act.” The Citizens Advice chief executive, Gillian Guy, said: “This league table will lift the lid on the price difference between standard tariffs and cheaper deals, helping those customers who are currently paying over the odds for their gas and electricity identify a better rate. “We’d also like to see energy companies do more off their own back to help customers who are on a low income, like moving them to a cheaper deal.” Mark Todd, the co-founder of energyhelpline.com, said the energy price league table would expose just how expensive standard energy tariffs were and how much customers could save by switching. “We hope this publication acts as a clarion call for consumers to ditch these horrible tariffs this Christmas. Standard energy tariffs offer almost no protection against price rises as well as very high prices. “They are the worst of all worlds. Around two thirds of the population, about 40 million people, are blighted by their scourge and so considerably poorer as a result. The basic rule is: never be on a standard variable energy tariff – they are a rip-off,” he said. Energy UK figures released on Wednesday showed more than 4 million customers switched electricity supplier this year, “eclipsing” the past three years, while more than 400,000 switched last month – the highest figure since November 2013. Lawrence Slade, the chief executive of the industry body Energy UK, said: “A record number of people have switched electricity supplier in 2016. This is fantastic progress, but more needs to be done. “Over 40 companies across the industry, big and small, are working hard to win customers. I’d encourage everyone to look at the best deal for them, whether that is one that offers a lower price or better customer service, there are choices for everyone.”",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Brexit migration rules could harm City's lead in financial services technology", "content": "London’s lead in financial services technology risks being blunted by bureaucratic new migration rules, according to business leaders cited by the latest House of Lords report on leaving the European Union. Peers conclude that the fast-growing sector is one of a number of world-beating industries at risk if London loses its status as an international melting pot for talent, partly because Europeans may not be able to come to work in the UK so freely. Some 60,000 EU nationals work in financial services jobs in the UK, and although the government has insisted that it does not wish to shut the door to highly skilled workers from abroad, City employers report that many are increasingly nervous since the referendum to leave the EU. “[We are] already finding less desire among bright eastern Europeans, Germans and French people to come and work in the UK,” warned Giles Andrews, chairman of startup Zopa, which says half its workforce is from outside the UK. As much as £50bn in yearly City revenues come from EU business Another witness to the Lords EU committee estimated that nearly a third of the entrepreneurs behind UK startup companies in the sector were born overseas, a sign of an “inherently international” industry where access to talent was paramount. “Obviously there is an entrepreneurial visa, but you have to have a huge amount of capital already in place behind you or prove that you are about to set up a business,” said Daniel Morgan of Innovate Finance. “Many of our founders came here just with an idea, and with a smaller labour pool, that talent will no longer gravitate here.” The warning about London’s role as a magnet for talent is supported by a separate report released on Thursday by the British Council, which interviewed 40,000 young people in the G20 on their perceptions of Britain. It found 36% of those in EU countries said that Brexit had had a negative impact on the UK’s attractiveness. Though higher proportions of those interviewed in non-EU countries remained favourably disposed, the council said the UK urgently needed “to address the more negative opinions [of] young people in Europe”. “Leaving the EU in a way that maintains relationships with the societies of Europe – and that strengthens these partnerships around the world – will be essential,” said chief executive Sir Ciarán Devane. Other new research suggests that non-Europeans are also being put off by London’s growing isolation after the vote for Brexit. A survey of American executives by law firm Gowling WLG indicates almost 40% of them are considering moving their British office to the EU, and two-thirds of the 533 US companies surveyed say the Brexit referendum was already having an effect on investment choices. But it is the latest in a series of reports from the House of Lords EU committee published on Thursday that provides the starkest warnings yet about the risks of Brexit to the City of London. As revealed in the Guardian on Wednesday, it warns that many banks and other City firms are fast approaching a point of no return in moving jobs out of the UK, and urgently calls for government reassurance about a transition phase to avoid going over a “cliff edge”. “We are concerned that, in the absence of clarity over the future relationship, firms may pre-empt uncertainty by relocating or restructuring, for instance by establishing subsidiaries or transferring staff, even though such changes may ultimately prove to be unnecessary,” warns the report by the financial services sub-committee. “This would not be in the interests of the industry or the UK.” The UK is the foremost clearing market for euro-denominated derivatives As expected, the report explores the consequence of City firms losing “passporting” rights to sell their services to European customers, but also highlights the wider impact on employees and the City’s delicate web of interconnected specialisms. “It is not a Lego set in which little pieces can be built up and put somewhere else,” said Alex Wilmot-Sitwell of Merrill Lynch. “The interconnectedness is very significant, and … we need to be assured that whatever happens from this point forward, the consequences and implications of any steps are understood.” Several of the witnesses call for a transition phase of two to three years, on top of the two-year negotiation phase, which is expected to begin in April, and compared the risks of getting it wrong to moving “nuclear waste”. “Migrating huge businesses from one jurisdiction to another requires an enormous amount of work,” said Wilmot-Sitwell. “That process is very dangerous; it is fraught with risks. The materials that are being moved are risky. You do not move nuclear waste in a race; you do it in a carefully coordinated and managed process.” The report calls on the Treasury to act as a champion for the City during the Brexit negotiations, warning that political pressure from rival European centres could be used to disrupt a move from passporting to so-called “equivalence” rules. Philip Hammond, the chancellor, has also insisted that he sees “no likelihood of our using powers to control migration into the UK to prevent companies from bringing highly skilled, highly paid workers here”. But witnesses to the Lords inquiry warned that this may not be enough for financial services firms, who want “to get the specialised labour that they need in a relatively efficient and smooth way”. Sir Charles Bean, of the London School of Economics, told the committee that the chief worry among employers is that “some heavy bureaucratic process is put in place that takes a very long time to operate and becomes very cumbersome”.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Don’t blame MPs: British bombs wouldn’t have saved Aleppo", "content": "As east Aleppo falls to Bashar al-Assad’s murderous regime, the postmortem has begun. How could this sickening onslaught and its miserable human cost have been avoided? All too predictably, fingers point back at the culprits of 2013, those who prevented the west from bombing Assad’s forces. Those who backed the wars in Iraq and Libya feel tainted by the bloodshed in the calamities that followed. They accept that the killing fields of Iraq and the disintegrated state of Libya substantially weakened the moral case for western intervention. The horror of Aleppo presents the counter-argument: the cost of inaction. Those who opposed intervention are also stained with blood, goes the argument. It feels grubby to enter such a debate as Aleppo burns, but the revision of history demands a response. Aleppo civilians plead for help as airstrikes resume: 'Save us' Read more Let us be clear. Assad and Vladimir Putin are responsible for heinous crimes. Social media abounds with their apologists, those who think they are so radical, the arch-critics of western imperialism, but who are actually both hypocrites and a moral disgrace. Yesterday’s front page of the Morning Star rightly provoked revulsion when it described Aleppo’s fall as a “liberation”. When the US pummels countries with bombs, such apologists would never dream of denying civilian casualties. When Russia and its allies are responsible, they echo the language of the most ardent neocon: that the dead in Aleppo are not civilians but terrorists; that civilian deaths are either inventions or entirely the responsibility of rebel militia; that civilians are all rejoicing at their “liberation”. On Tuesday Syria’s ambassador to the United Nations, Bashar Jaafari, held up a photograph of a kindly soldier helping a woman from a truck. “This is a Syrian soldier,” he claimed. “She is a woman fleeing eastern Aleppo.” In the age of the internet, such lies are unwise. It was swiftly discovered that this was, in fact, a woman in Falluja, in neighbouring Iraq, being helped by state militia. Falluja itself is a reminder of the moral bankruptcy of those who criticise western imperialism but apologise for Russia. They were the first to – rightly – denounce US forces who assaulted the city in 2004, using white phosphorus as they did so, a substance that can burn down to the bone. And yet they deny an even worse atrocity today, because it is not being committed by the US. The UN has received credible evidence of up to 82 Aleppo civilians being shot dead where they stood. Amnesty International speaks of “reports that civilians – including children – are being massacred in cold blood”, and that Russian-backed Syrian forces “have repeatedly displayed a callous disregard for international humanitarian law”. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Aleppo civilians paying brutal price, says UN – video Up to 100,000 civilians are said to be crammed into an area of no more than two square kilometres: Lina Shami, an activist in Aleppo, reports there are “no safe areas” and that civilians are “threatened with field executions or are dying under bombing”. Russian bombing has been indiscriminate, annihilating local infrastructure. Yes, what began as a democratic struggle in Syria more than five years ago has been sabotaged by Islamist extremists – such as Islamic State, which came in from post-invasion Iraq – but Aleppo had a democratically elected council and independent civil society, now lost. Are those who opposed military intervention against Assad in 2013, before the west turned its firepower on his Islamist extremist opponents, to blame? Here is what the then prime minister, David Cameron, told the House of Commons in 2013 in the debate before proposed intervention. “It is not about taking sides in the Syrian conflict, it is not about invading, it is not about regime change, and it is not even about working more closely with the opposition: it is about the large-scale use of chemical weapons and our response to a war crime – nothing else.” Whatever the argument for larger-scale intervention – and why it would have been opposed, because of Iraq and Libya, because of the ascendant extremist groups in Syria’s conflicts – it wasn’t even on the table. Neither was it proposed by the US president, Barack Obama. As the New York Times reported in August 2013, action was considered to “deter and degrade” Assad’s “ability to launch chemical weapons” – but it was explicitly not about regime change or even “forcing him to the negotiating table”. Nothing about specific areas of Syria, nothing about the rebels. It was explicitly sold as a limited operation focused entirely on chemical weapons. Yes, there was the obvious fear that this would mean creeping direct military involvement, and there is no precedent of western military intervention in the Arab world ending in anything other than disaster. It was, nonetheless, not what was debated. There are, however, concrete actions that the west could be undertaking now. As Mark Boothroyd from Syria Solidarity Movement UK tells me, the case for British humanitarian airdrops in Aleppo and elsewhere is overwhelming. These would show support for people who are besieged, whom Assad and his Russian backers are trying to starve out. A UN-monitored evacuation plan needs to be put in place. Russia needs to come under pressure for its criminal behaviour in Syria – with further sanctions considered. Aleppo’s people are being slaughtered. Did we learn nothing from Srebrenica? | Nedžad Avdić Read more Syria is a reminder of the need for consistency. Those of us who passionately opposed the disastrous western wars in Iraq and Libya are not apologists for Putin or Assad. Similarly, those who denounce the opponents of western intervention should have far more humility about Iraq and Libya: the hundreds of thousands dead, the sectarian conflict, the millions displaced and traumatised, the extremist groups flourishing in the chaos. They should speak out about the west’s alliance with a head-chopping dictatorship such as Saudi Arabia, which exports extremism - including to Syria - and which is butchering Yemeni civilians with British-made bombs. If you oppose war crimes, if you oppose the murder of innocent civilians, you should speak out about whoever is responsible. There is no contradiction in opposing the crimes of western or Russian foreign policy, or in denouncing both the bombs of Syria and of Saudi Arabia. As I say, call it consistency. Or perhaps a better word is humanity.",diasaster:0},

It’s less about the grit and sweat of the struggle to the top, more a fantastically entertaining ride on the showbiz rollercoaster, accompanied by some brilliantly belting voices. Casey Nicholaw (Aladdin, The Book of Mormon) directs the UK premiere, 35 years after the original Broadway show by Henry Krieger and Tom Eyen, which was adapted for a 2006 film starring Jamie Foxx and Beyoncé Knowles. The story follows a wide-eyed trio hoping to harmonise their way to stardom. Their talented lead singer, Effie (Glee’s Amber Riley), is sidelined when pretty, pop-friendly Deena (Liisi LaFontaine) is chosen to front the group. It’s clearly inspired by the real story of Diana Ross and the Supremes. Its weakness, sadly, is that the songs are nowhere near as good as the Supremes’ hits. But what it does have is tremendous energy and pace, crammed with snappy numbers and tight, slick 60s routines. This is a tale of transformation: from naive hopefuls into jaded superstars, from raw R&B into the disco era, from success to failure, and then back again. Tim Hatley’s sets are constantly on the move, creating a succession of stages, dressing rooms and recording studios. Gregg Barnes’s costumes, dipped in an acid palette and a truckload of sequins, track the movement of time, gown by gown (with some awesome quick changes). And respect to Josh Marquette’s hair design – you can see the wigs getting more expensive with every move up the charts. Facebook Twitter Pinterest A tale of transformation … Amber Riley, Tyrone Huntley, Liisi LaFontaine and Ibinabo Jack. Photograph: Brinkhoff-Moegenburg Riley is a real star in her first West End role, the voice huge and effortless, her no-nonsense Effie a woman who knows her worth but is all too easily made vulnerable by love. Ibinabo Jack is baby of the group Lorrell, trying on sassy confidence but desperately insecure underneath as she longs for commitment from swivel-hipped sex machine Jimmy (Adam J Bernard, showing off fantastic voice and comic chops). Tyrone Huntley, a show-stealer earlier this year as Judas in Jesus Christ Superstar, has a sweeter part here as songwriter CC, the depth and honesty of his voice turning the potentially saccharine Family into one of the show’s more touching moments. Eyen’s book is more functional than fizzing, and there are certainly more subtle layers to be revealed in some of the relationships, especially that of Curtis (Joe Aaron Reid) and Deena, the husband/manager who sees his wife/star as a possession. The strongest numbers are the big ballads made famous by the 2006 film. Listen, written especially for the film, here provides a much-needed emotional payoff at the show’s climax. On a stage full of great singers, gutsy Riley is a notch above them all, underplaying her melismatic skill, her voice switching from a dagger to a whisper. The first act closes with the barnstorming And I Am Telling You I’m Not Going (a song that in the wrong hands could easily be And I Am Yelling...) and Riley’s Effie is defiant even as she’s crumbling. Her massive voice rips through the auditorium, the killer line: “You’re gonna love me” addressed first to the man breaking her heart, then direct to the audience. “You’re gonna love me,” she growls again, and it’s not an appeal, it’s an order.

The frequent and heavy precipitation last winter, mostly in the form of rain, meant that it was the wettest since before 1766, and it was the eighth warmest in records that stretch back to 1659. Every month except for August had above-average temperatures, with December looking like it will finish just above normal. There were lengthy warm periods in June, July, September and October, which brought the warmest Halloween on record. March, June, July and September were drier than average, especially September, which has not been as dry in England and Wales since 1959, or across the UK since 1910. It was sunnier than normal in March, June (except for Scotland) and July. The strongest wind gust, away from high-level sites, was 108mph, at Aberdaron in Gwynedd on 12 February. Temperatures January and February were very mild. January was the warmest since 2008 and February only since 2011. May was also the warmest since 2008 and June since 2006. The only cool month of the year, August, was the coolest since 1993 and was unusually a shade cooler than September. The lowest temperature of the year, up to 23 December, was recorded on 17 February when Altnaharra in Sutherland dropped to –7.7C. The highest was on 18 July when Swanscombe in Kent recorded 32.3C. The date-record temperature on 31 October was also at Swanscombe and at Kew Gardens in London, both places seeing a high of 23.6C – a remarkable 4.2 degrees above the previous warmest Halloween. Precipitation Because the winter and early spring were so mild, almost all of the precipitation that fell from January to March was rain, except for snow over the highest ground in northern regions. The winter of 2013-14 from December to February was the wettest since before 1766, with 447mm recorded over England and Wales.

{ "title":"Top 10 housebuilders to rake in £2.1bn in 2014", "content": "Britain’s ten biggest housebuilders will see profits climb to more than £2bn this year despite the industry falling far short of local government targets on affordable homes. While profits surge back to levels not seen since the last credit-fuelled property boom, the number of affordable homes built in England has fallen to an eight-year low. Analysis by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism shows that the country’s biggest builders, who between them control enough land to create 480,000 homes, will make pretax profits of more than £2.1bn in 2014 – a 34% jump on last year. The total is based on reported and projected profits for firms including Persimmon, Taylor Wimpey and Barratt, many of which have seen sales boosted by the government’s Help to Buy schemes. The return to pre-crash profit levels comes as official figures forecast 42,710 affordable homes will be built in England in the year to April – the lowest number since 2006, and a 26% fall since 2010. Jon Sparkes chief executive of homeless campaign group Crisis, said: “At a time when the country faces a housing crisis and with homelessness having risen significantly in recent years, we desperately need developers to provide more affordable homes.” Steve Turner of the Home Builders Federation whose members account for 80% of houses built in England and Wales, said: “The industry was devastated in the financial crash, profits initially fell very steeply, or disappeared into losses, and many companies disappeared. Only now are profits returning to pre-crash levels allowing companies to rebuild, restructure and replace lost capacity.” Affordability campaigners suggest part of the reason why developers have failed to achieve targets for cheaper homes is to be found in an opaque part of the planning system, known as the financial viability test. This is widely used by housebuilders to reduce, perfectly legally, the number of affordable homes to below local authority targets. More than half of affordable homes in England are built by private developers through what is known as the Section 106 system, in which tests of financial viability are key. These assessments form the basis of negotiations with local authorities when developers want to reduce the number of low-cost homes below the local authority’s targets. Targets typically range between 25% and 40% of the total number of homes in a scheme and are set according to local housing need. The assessment works by combining all the costs linked to a housing development, including a 20% margin for the developer but excluding the land price. These costs are then subtracted from a scheme’s projected sales revenue based on current values. If the resulting total is not much higher than its current use value, the scheme is likely to be considered unviable by developers who will then argue the number of affordable homes required must be cut. This means assumptions on sales and costs are crucial. The bureau’s research has found that: • The process is shrouded in secrecy with many developers regularly refusing to disclose to the public the assessments on which their figures are based. • Councils rarely employ external experts to scrutinise housebuilders’ figures contained in financial viability submissions. • Sales projections used in viability assessments are frozen at the time a scheme receives planning consent preventing the council from sharing in any benefit from rising house prices. Housing campaign groups point to 1.4m households on council waiting lists – a 34% rise since 1997 – and 85,000 children living in temporary accommodation, equivalent to more than the entire population of the Hertfordshire town of Stevenage. They argue the government now has to put pressure on builders to meet affordable housing targets. Joanna Kennedy, chief executive of housing and welfare campaign group Z2K, said: “If Whitehall genuinely wants to tackle the housing crisis they should be supporting boroughs in challenging developers’ questionable viability assessments, instead of undermining council’s efforts to secure planning gain through section 106.” A Department for Communities and Local Government spokesman said: “It is for local authorities to agree an appropriate level of contribution to affordable housing with developers.Our guidance is clear that changes in costs and property value should be considered in longer term developments, and councils should use appropriate methods and expertise, whether in-house or external, to determine these.”",diasaster:0},

He gave no details of the continued attacks or the company’s response. “We cannot let cyber-attacks stop nuclear power operation,” Cho told a news briefing. He said a closed network used for reactor operations was inaccessible from external communication lines and impervious to cyber-attacks. “We will continue operating nuclear plants safely against any attempted foul play.” KHNP, part of state-run utility Korea Electric Power, said last Monday that its computer systems had been hacked but only non-critical data had been stolen, and reactor operations were not at risk. Cho apologised for concerns that had been raised by the cyber-attack and data leaks. South Korea has 23 nuclear reactors which supply one-third of its electricity. Three are currently offline for routine maintenance or awaiting a licence extension.

{ "title":"Michael Schumacher faces ‘long fight for recovery,’ says manager", "content": "Michael Schumacher faces a “long fight” for recovery as the first anniversary of his skiing accident approaches, the former Formula One driver’s manager said on Sunday. Her comments cast doubts over a newspaper report that said he was making cognitive progress. “We need a long time. It’s going to be a long time and a hard fight,” Sabine Kehm told Reuters. “He is making progress appropriate to the severity of the situation,” she added, reiterating a statement she made a month ago. Schumacher suffered severe head injuries in a ski accident in Meribel in the French Alps on 29 December 2013. He emerged from an induced coma in June, and left hospital in September. In an interview with Le Parisien on Sunday, Philippe Streiff, another former F1 driver, said Schumacher “had yet to recover the power of speech” but was “nevertheless starting to recognise those close to him”. Streiff, described by the newspaper as a long-time friend, said he had gleaned the information from contact with the German driver’s wife, Corinne, and with his surgeon, Gerard Saillant, whom he knows as a result of his own racing accident in 1989. He said Schumacher, who will be 46 on 3 January, had “very limited” movement but was working on sitting upright, and that “long term … he could hope one day to walk with crutches”. Kehm said Streiff was not a close friend of Schumacher and that his claims to have had contact with the two people named were “factually wrong”. “I cannot confirm that [report],” she said. “I can only confirm that I do not know where Streiff has his information from because he has no contact with us and he never has.” On Sunday night Saillant issued a statement saying that he had not had “the slightest verbal, written, or physical contact” with Streiff in the past year. Schumacher, who won a record 91 F1 races, left the sport in 2012 after a disappointing three-year comeback with Mercedes following an earlier retirement from Ferrari at the end of 2006.",diasaster:0},

The centres were set up in the hours following the disappearance of the AirAsia aircraft, which vanished from radar in Indonesian airspace on Sunday morning while on its way to Singapore. At Changi aiport, anxious relatives were kept apart from a large press pack, but one Indonesian national told the waiting media that she was waiting for news of her fiance, whom she identified as a 27-year-old entrepreneur called Alain and who she said was on board the flight along with five family members. Louise Sidharta, 25, said she and her partner had taken separate flights from Surabaya to Singapore, and she only found out about the missing aircraft upon arriving in Singapore on a later flight, reported AFP. She told reporters she was hoping for the best and urged everyone to “think positive thoughts” “This was supposed to be his last trip with his family before we got married,” she added. At Juanda international airport, dozens of friends and relatives of those on board, many in tears, could be seen holding on to each other for support and speaking down mobile phones as they followed the search and rescue operation launched by the Indonesian government. A friend of a missing passenger, who did not give his name, said he was hoping for a miracle and that all on board would be saved. He said he had been scheduled to fly on the AirAsia plane but had cancelled two weeks ago. “I hope for a miracle and may God save all of them,” he said. “I should have gone with them but I cancelled it two weeks ago becuase I had something else to do. I have two friends and they went with five family members.” He added that he had planned to spend New Year in Singapore, but had changed his mind. “This morning before I went to pray one of them called me and said: ‘See you in the New Year.’ That’s all, and then the bad news came.” According to AirAsia, 162 people were on board the Airbus A320-200, including seven crew – six Indonesian, one French. There were 155 Indonesians, three South Koreans, one French national, one Malaysian, one Singaporean and one British passenger, according to the airline. The UK Foreign Office has also confirmed that a Briton was on board the flight. A spokesman said: “We are aware of an incident regarding AirAsia flight QZ8501. Our thoughts are with the passengers’ families as they await further news. We have been informed by the local authorities that one British national was on board. Their next of kin has been informed, and we stand ready to provide consular assistance.” One woman in Surabaya, who had six relatives on board, told AFP: “I am shocked to hear the news. And I am very worried that the plane might have crashed.” One tearful family member, identified as Erna W, was quoted by Antara news agency as saying that she had four family members on board the missing aircraft. “I hope I can get information soon on the whereabouts of our family members,” she said. Djoko Murjatmodjo, Indonesia’s acting director general of transportation, said the last communication between the pilot and air traffic control was at 6,13am. (11.13pm GMT on Saturday) when the pilot “asked to avoid clouds by turning left and going higher to 34,000ft (10,360 metres)”. He said: “We don’t dare to presume what has happened except that it has lost contact,” adding that no distress signal was sent. AirAsia Indonesia confirmed that contact had been lost with flight QZ8501 from Surabaya to Singapore, adding that it would fully cooperate with and assist rescue services. “AirAsia Indonesia regrets to confirm that flight QZ8501 from Surabaya to Singapore has lost contact with air traffic control at 7:24 this morning,” the airline company said on Sunday. “At the present time we unfortunately have no further information regarding the status of the passengers and crew members on board, but we will keep all parties informed as more information becomes available. At this time, search and rescue operations are in progress and AirAsia is cooperating fully and assisting the rescue service.

{ "title":"US Federal Reserve raises interest rates for second time since 2008 crisis", "content": "The US Federal Reserve on Wednesday raised interest rates for the first time in a year, and only the second time since the 2008 financial crisis. The US central bank also predicted three further rates increase in 2017, up from previous expectations of two rate hikes. Janet Yellen, the Fed chairwoman, said “growth is a touch stronger, unemployment is a shade lower” as she announced a 0.25% increase in the benchmark rate to 0.50-0.75%. It is the first time rates have been raised since December 2015 when the benchmark rate was lifted from near-zero for seven years since the crisis. “My colleagues and I are recognizing the considerable progress the economy has made towards our dual objectives of maximum employment and price stability,” Yellen said. “We expect that the economy will continue to perform well, with the job market strengthening further, and inflation rising to 2% over the next couple of years.” interactive Yellen also set out a path of faster pace of rate increases next year than previously expected. The rate setting Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) said it expected to raise short-term rates by another 0.75% percentage points next year – probably in three separate quarter-point moves – up from a previously predicted 2017 increase of 0.5%. “The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting some further strengthening in labor market conditions and a return to 2% inflation,” the FOMC said in a statement. The unanimous decision to raise rates, the first time in months that the 10 members of FOMC had all agreed on policy, came at the end of the committee’s first rate-setting meeting since the election of Donald Trump as America’s next president. The statement made no mention of the effect of Trump’s policies on the country’s economic prospects. But experts have said Trump’s plans for massive tax cuts and huge infrastructure investment could spur the economic recovery. US stock markets, which soared to record highs following Trump’s victory, fell slightly following the decision, which had been widely expected by traders and economists. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was hovering at 19,954 points – a more than 9% increase since the 8 November election. Trump has repeatedly criticised Yellen for not raising interest rates fast enough, which he said had created a “false economy” and delayed the recovery, and called for her to be replaced. In September, he said Yellen “should be ashamed of herself”. “I used to hope that the Fed was independent,” he said. “And the Fed is obviously not independent. It’s obviously not even close to being independent.” Trump had said he is unlikely to nominate Yellen to continue as Fed chief when her term expires in early 2018. Yellen has refused to leave before the end of her term. Rob Carnell, chief international economist at ING, said: “The big takeaway from this meeting was the increase in the pace of tightening signaled for 2017. Where two rate hikes of 25bp were signaled in the previous guidance, there are now three hikes signaled. “Despite this, the other forecast variables are little changed. Probably most noteworthy is the small 0.1 percentage point increase in 2017 GDP growth, now expected to be 2.1%, but no further increase is expected in 2018, which is unchanged at 2.0%. The 2019 GDP forecast is also only slightly higher at 1.9% (1.8% previously). There is not much concession in these growth forecasts to expectations of big fiscal stimulus from a Trump administration and our own forecasts are considerably higher – closer to 3% in both years.” Jeremy Cook, chief economist at international payments company World First, said: “The Federal Reserve found enough strength in the US economy to hike 25 basis points for the first time this year. This means basically nothing.” “What matters is that the expectations shown in the dot plot charts show a Federal Reserve that is supremely uncertain as to the path of US economy moves into 2017. They’ve noted the strength in inflation and the jobs market but this is a central bank eager to know what kind of administration they will have to work with. Until then there was little chance of them basing policy on the pronouncements of someone who has a casual relationship with consistency.” “Our eyes now move back to the politics in the United States and the rebuttal of the Fed’s decision from the president-elect via his Twitter account.” Rates had been expected to be raised earlier this year, but the decision was delayed by concerns about a slowdown in the Chinese economy, Brexit and the unpredictable US presidential election. The Fed predicted economic growth reaching 1.9% this year, slightly above its forecast in September. However, it kept its long-term estimate for economic growth at 1.8%, far below the 4% pace that Trump promises to deliver via a program of deregulation, tax cuts and infrastructure spending. The committee expects little improvement in the unemployment rate from the current rate of 4.6%. The rate hike was widely expected with all 120 economists polled by Reuters expecting an interest rates increase.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Greece on collision course with lenders as ESM freezes debt relief", "content": "The dispute between Greece and its creditors has turned more ugly after the European body financing the country’s €86bn (£72bn) bailout programme decided to freeze a deal on short-term debt relief measures. The prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, was taken by surprise on Wednesday when the European Stability Mechanism announced it would not honour an accord to ease the burden of repayment obligations on Greece’s debt pile. The decision, taken in direct retribution for a series of surprise social welfare measures unveiled by the leader, is likely to put Athens on a war footing with lenders amid mounting signs of the Greek crisis flaring again. Last week, Tsipras took the unexpected step of declaring a one-off pre-Christmas bonus for an estimated 1.6 million retirees living on €800 or less a month. This week he added that the Aegean islands would be exempt from a sales tax demanded by creditors. “Following recent proposals by the Greek government to spend additional fiscal resources for pensions and VAT, our governing bodies have put their decisions temporarily on hold,” said a spokesman for the ESM, referring to a deal that would have deferred an interest rate increase on Greece’s debt. “Institutions are currently assessing the impact of Greek government decisions vis-à-vis the ESM programme commitments and targets. [We] will then analyse the institutions’ assessment and subsequently decide how to proceed.” The announcement followed a statement by the Euro group of finance ministers, representing members of the single currency, which also suggested that Athens had acted out of line. Earlier on Wednesday Germany – the single biggest contributor to the three bailouts Greece has received since 2010 – said the benefits were incompatible with programme targets. Everyone has to respect the Greek people, who for the last seven years have made huge sacrifices in the name of Europe Alexis Tsipras But Tsipras, whose popularity has waned considerably since his leftwing government implemented wage cuts and tax increases it once vowed to overturn, appears in defiant mood. Despite the outcry he has categorically refused to rescind the special pension supplement, saying the €617m required for the bonus will be drawn from the budget surplus his government has managed to achieve. Visiting the northern city of Thessaloniki on Wednesday, he ratcheted up his anti-austerity rhetoric, announcing that Athens would spend €11.5m next year extending free meals to 30,000 underprivileged schoolchildren. “This programme has been factored in to the budget of 2017,” he told local mayors, denying the aid would derail the programme of tough fiscal targets Greece has agreed to meet. “I think everyone has to respect the Greek people, who for the last seven years have made huge sacrifices in the name of Europe. We have carried the weight of the refugee crisis. In the name of Europe we have, in recent years, implemented an extremely hard policy of austerity. There has to be respect from all.” The prospect of the Greek debt crisis flaring up again came as Athens also sparred with the International Monetary Fund which, with the exception of a third bailout signed last summer, has supported the rescue packages shoring up the Greek economy. On Tuesday Tsipras derided IMF staff as “foolish technocrats” who had repeatedly miscalculated the impact of recessionary policies on the country. “They can’t even get their numbers right,” he said, after Greek officials reacted furiously to what they described as intense IMF pressure to adopt further austerity once bailout loans end in 2018. “They’ve often admitted that they’ve been wrong, but now they’re telling us again, ‘What’s wrong is right’.” With tensions escalating – and local media painting relations with creditors in terms of open warfare – any hope of concluding an ongoing review of the latest programme has quickly faded. Tsipras, who hopes to break the deadlock in talks later this week with his French and German counterparts, has signalled that he will ask the IMF to withdraw from the bailout altogether. Few believe that will assuage creditor sentiment at a time when Athens is perceived to be dragging its feet on reforms.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Parents do not recognise that their children are overweight, survey finds", "content": "The vast majority of parents of overweight children in England do not recognise the fact, the annual NHS health survey has found, raising fears that high levels of obesity have normalised unhealthy weights. Nine in 10 mothers and eight in 10 fathers of an overweight child described them as being about the right weight. Almost half of mothers (48%) and 43% of fathers said their obese child was about the right weight, according to the Health Survey for England 2015, published by NHS Digital on Wednesday. Gillian Prior, head of health at the National Centre for Social Research, said: “Around three in 10 children are overweight or obese, yet nearly half of mothers think their obese child is about the right weight. It is possible that consistently high levels of childhood obesity in recent years have normalised an unhealthy weight. “This should be of concern to parents and public health professionals alike. Obesity is linked to a number of health conditions in later life, such as diabetes and heart disease. Parents want to do the best for their children and the difficulty of recognising obesity in their own child could be putting them at risk.” The survey showed that child obesity remains stubbornly high, despite attempts to raise public awareness of the problem. In 2015, 28% of children were either overweight (14%) or obese (14%). This was down from the previous year, when the figure was 31% and the 2004 peak of 34%, but higher than 20 years ago, when it was 25%. Obesity, which is defined as a BMI of 30 or more for adults, also remains high among adults. Over a quarter (27% of men and women) were obese last year and a further 41% of men and 31% of women were overweight. The average waist circumference of an adult reached its highest ever figure – 92.9cm, or 36.57in, (88.4cm, or 34.8in, for women and 97.4cm, or 38.34in, for men) – compared with 87.1cm when the survey began in 1993. Carrying too much fat around your middle can increase the risk of developing conditions such as heart disease, type 2 diabetes and cancer. Almost half of women (47%) and just over a third of men (35%) were found to have a very high waist circumference, defined as a waist circumference greater than 88cm for women and greater than 102cm for men. The Obesity Health Alliance, a coalition of more than 30 leading charities, royal medical colleges and campaign groups, said: “Obesity is still an urgent public health epidemic costing our national health service billions of pounds every year. Prevalence hasn’t changed much but the majority of adults remain worryingly obese or overweight. As our waistlines continue to increase, so do the chances of developing type 2 diabetes, cancer, cardiovascular disease and other devastating health conditions. “We must take bold action now by bringing in measures like the soft drinks industry levy, reducing the sugar, salt and fat from everyday foods and restricting junk food marketing to children. We still have a way to go to truly tackle this deadly and economically draining obesity issue. However, these proposed measures will be a major step towards creating a healthier environment.” The survey was based on interviews with 8,034 adults and 5,714 children. Alison Tedstone, chief nutritionist at Public Health England, said: “Parents have been misjudging their children’s weight for a number of years, making addressing our current obesity crisis even more challenging. “Tackling obesity is everyone’s responsibility, not individual parents and children. We’re working with industry to reduce the amount of sugar in products children consume every day as part of a wider childhood obesity plan to help them lead healthier lives.”",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Isis video claims to show abandoned Russian base in Palmyra", "content": "A video released by Islamic State’s news agency, Amaq, appears to show a hasty Russian retreat from a forward base near the Syrian city of Palmyra, recaptured by Isis over the weekend, with half-eaten bowls of soup, bank cards and a significant amount of weaponry left behind. Palmyra’s recapture came seven months after a Russian orchestra held a symbolic concert in its amphitheatre to celebrate its liberation from the terrorist group. The video shows Isis fighters looking around a deserted base made up of a few field tents. Most significantly, if the video is genuine, it appears that the Russian army left fighting equipment at the base. The footage shows fighters opening boxes containing assault rifles, ammunition and other weaponry. US army general Stephen Townsend said armour and potentially air defence equipment could have fallen into the group’s hands, and the Russian weapons seized by Isis could pose a threat to US forces. “Look at the war booty,” says one of the Isis fighters in the video. “This is the Syrian sovereignty they are talking about. This is the gate of the Russian base in the city of Tadmur [the Arabic name for Palmyra]. God allowed us to conquer it today. Tomorrow, we will conquer Russia.” Facebook Twitter Pinterest Russian novels left at the base in the city of Palmyra. Photograph: YouTube The video has not been independently verified and it is unclear exactly when it was taken. The Palmyra citadel is visible in one of the shots. The Russian defence ministry has not commented on the authenticity of the video, nor is it known how many Russian troops were stationed at the base and for how long. Much of the year-long Russian mission in Syria has been shrouded in secrecy and publicly released information carefully curated. A video aired on Russian television at the weekend showed Russian special forces active inside the country. Russian television has portrayed the restoration of government control over Aleppo as a liberation from terror. Isis took control of Palmyra over the weekend after days of intense fighting and Russian airstrikes. “The catastrophe has happened, I am in absolute shock,” Maamoun Abdulkarim, Syria’s director of antiquities, told the Guardian on Sunday in a phone interview. “I am losing hope, it looks like we have lost the city.” The Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad, told Russia Today: “The timing of their attack is related to what is happening in Aleppo”. Igor Konashenkov of the Russian defence ministry, claimed on Monday that the militants had been able to attack Palmyra because US-led coalition air forces had stopped bombing Raqqa, Isis’s Syrian stronghold. “Taking advantage of the fact that active military operations of the United States and the international coalition near Raqqa were suspended until spring, Daesh [Isis] redeployed significant forces to storm Palmyra,” he said. Konashenkov claimed around 5,000 Isis militants had taken part in the attack on Palmyra, which surprised analysts given the group has been in retreat in recent months. Despite a sustained Russian air bombardment, the takeover was successful. It marks the second time Isis has taken over Palmyra. Last May, the grouping’s militants laid siege to the city and then stormed it after Syrian military forces retreated. The militants blew up many of its ancient buildings, including the 2,000-year-old Temple of Bel and the Arch of Victory, along with other priceless artefacts. They also killed Khaled al-Asaad, Palmyra’s long-serving leading archaeologist. Syrian forces retook the town in March, and in early May the Russian conductor Valery Gergiev led an orchestra of musicians from his Mariinsky Theatre in St Petersburg in a symbolic concert, with journalists and Russian military operatives in attendance. Putin addressed the concert by video link, saying it was to celebrate the liberation of Palmyra and the defeat of “international terrorism”.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Madrid’s white politicians ‘must stop blacking up’ for Three Kings parade", "content": "Tired of seeing white politicians “black up” for a children’s post-Christmas street parade, almost 62,000 people have signed an online petition demanding that Madrid council choose a black man to play the role of Balthazar in the city’s Three Kings cavalcade next week. Arguing that “it is senseless and unnecessary in this day and age for the king Balthazar to be a white man painted black”, signatories of the petition on change.org have criticised what they see as an offensive and anachronistic practice. “Children aren’t stupid; they realise it’s a con when they see a white man who has blacked up,” said one signatory. “Children must know that black people are not just immigrants on boats or street vendors without papers,” remarked another. Madrid city hall insists the choice is not racist but simply traditional. Since the return of democracy after the death of Franco, the right to be one of the Three Kings has been decided by city councillors drawing lots. “We don’t have any non-white councillors, and nor can I remember there being any,” a spokeswoman explains, adding that representatives of the People’s party, Socialists and UPyD centrist grouping from the 57-strong assembly will pose as Magi next week. A year ago Diego Cruz, the leader of the council’s Socialist group, said publicly that the parade should represent Madrid’s multi-ethnic diversity. But nothing seems to have changed. “Madrid has become a different city since this tradition began and the truth is that city hall has not changed so much. But I think it would be cheating to change this and feel we have solved the diversity issue,” says Cruz, arguing that the key problem is a lack of political representation for ethnic minorities. For Esteban Ibarra, the leader of Spain’s Movement Against Intolerance, the underlying problem is that the public presence of minorities is virtually non-existent. Spain’s national parliament and regional assemblies are devoid of members with a non-European background. “As well as black people, Gypsies, Muslims or Jews do not have any public presence either. Spain reflects its diversity poorly and this is reflected in ridiculous incongruences such as having a white councillor blacking up to be Balthazar,” he said.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"AirAsia plane disappearance: storm clouds may be key clue", "content": "Despite the offers of international assistance in the hunt for the aircraft, wreckage from the flight is expected to be found once the planes from Indonesia and its neighbours resume their visual search on Monday morning. Unlike Malaysian Airlines flight MH370, the spectre that haunts the world of aviation even as it stresses the relative safety of flying, this disappearance has not been accompanied by puzzling patterns of behaviour from the flight deck or radar. But on Sunday night, for the second time in less than a year, hundreds of passengers appeared to have perished mid-flight without any immediate explanation. Most of the nine major fatal accidents in the 26-year history of this model of plane, the Airbus A320, have occurred on takeoff or landing or final approach. The manufacturer said one of these 6,000 short-haul workhorses, a twin-engine plane seating up to 180 passengers, takes off or lands somewhere in the world every few seconds. The plane that went missing between Surabaya in Indonesia and Singapore was delivered to AirAsia in 2008 and had recorded 23,000 flight hours on 13,600 flights, according to Airbus. It had undergone its last scheduled maintenance on 16 November. AirAsia carriers have had a clean safety record, although Indonesia’s faltering standards at one point saw all of its carriers barred from European airspace by the EU on safety grounds. Until any wreckage, and particularly the black boxes, are located, the most salient detail of this incident appears to be that the pilots had asked to change course to avoid cloud in the latter moments of the flight. Jakarta air traffic control had granted a request for the plane to ascend to 38,000ft. Satellite images show heavy thunderstorms in the vicinity. Although the request to go higher to avoid bad weather is not an unusual one, pilots are aware that flying over a thunderstorm will not necessarily mean clearing it: according to forecasters at Indonesia’s meteorology agency, dense storm clouds were detected up to 44,000ft when the plane was reported to have lost contact. Turbulence and strong gusts of winds would be likely. The disappearance of the plane without a distress call leaves little clues but makes a midair explosion or some other catastrophic failure a theoretical possibility. In the realm of speculation, a parallel cited on pilots’ forums and by aviation experts was the crash of Air France flight 447, which was lost at sea in 2009 via a combination of severe weather, technical failure and pilot disorientation. Frozen sensors corrupted the instrument readings and led pilots to believe they were losing height, and misguided attempts to correct the plane’s course led to a fatal stall. The European Aviation Safety Agency earlier this month issued an emergency airworthiness directive for planes in the Airbus A320 family after an incident when computers on an A321 tried, needlessly, to prevent a stall at the top of a climb by automatically pushing the nose downwards, after sensors iced up. But flight tracking data suggests the path of QZ8501 would not have triggered a similar anomaly. Doug Maclean, an aviation expert and former air traffic controller, said that while contact was lost at 6.17am, an emergency was only declared at 7.24am – a delay reminiscent of the Malaysian response, although one unlikely on this occasion to alter the outcome. Pilots were in contact with air traffic control until the last minute. David Learmount, a former pilot and now operations and safety editor of Flight Global, said: “Storms can be very, very powerful indeed and rip a medium-sized aeroplane completely apart, that’s why a pilot will routinely ask to divert around them.” Maclean said: “I’ve seen very large planes shifted anything up to 4,000ft by turbulence; a thunderstorm often extends far over a cloud. Pilots are very wary of flying above the top of a storm because the air could be very violent. If you’ve taken the airplane up to 38,000ft, you’re into slightly marginal conditions for the airplane to fly in … If you’re also hit by turbulence, you could more easily see the aircraft out of control.” Another plane had passed through roughly the same airspace at the same level earlier: the course was not unusual, Maclean said. But at higher altitudes and lower temperatures, the margins for error in flight are tighter. “A smaller loss of speed would be critical. Purely speculatively, something could have happened dramatically in that little marginal envelope to affect the plane very significantly and put it in an unflyable position.”",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Cold weather warning for motorists as temperatures fall to -10C in parts of UK", "content": "Large parts of Britain are expected to wake up to severe weather conditions on Monday, with temperatures forecast to drop below freezing overnight and to as low as -10C in rural areas. Although further significant snowfall is not expected in the coming days, the RAC is warning people to be prepared for icy conditions on the roads. The Met Office said the west of Britain was most likely to suffer from lingering patches of freezing fog. Over the weekend travellers on the roads and railways faced testing conditions. The Office of Rail Regulation said it was launching an investigation after the biggest rail maintenance programme in years over-ran, forcing the cancellation of services at King’s Cross in London on Saturday. Trains stopped prematurely at Finsbury Park a few miles north, and the far smaller station soon became overwhelmed by the crowds, leaving thousands of passengers queuing for hours in the cold. The transport secretary, Patrick McLoughlin, demanded answers from rail bosses, and Sir Nicholas Soames, a senior Conservative backbencher, called for sackings at the rail operator Network Rail, claiming there had been a fundamental breakdown in the management and leadership of Britain’s railway industry. Snow was cleared from roads in central and northern parts of England, and power was restored to 100,000 homes that had been cut off by the weather. The first death resulting from the cold snap was identified as a pensioner from Bradford, who died on Boxing Day after he was struck by a car while trying to excavate his own vehicle from a snowdrift at the roadside. He was named locally as 75-year-old Graham Maloney. After services at King’s Cross resumed on Sunday morning. Robin Gisby, a managing director at Network Rail, said: “I would like to sincerely apologise for the upset and upheaval passengers suffered yesterday as our engineers struggled to complete an essential improvement project that had been months in planning. “We now move our focus to completing the handful of other projects still under way without further impact on passengers. We will also begin our investigation into what went wrong with the work at Holloway [north of King’s Cross] and the planning that went into this project.” Soames, an MP for Mid Sussex, said he was horrified by the railway industry’s performance over Christmas. He said on LBC radio: “This is a problem for management and leadership – no other commercial organisation would set about this problem without a very clear idea of how they were going to do it, how long it would take, what it was they would use and what would be the finish time. “They have failed on every single count and I understand that they even got the wrong piece of equipment to the line north of King’s Cross and then the replacement that was sent was wrong. Whoever ordered that needs to be dismissed from service immediately – that is just a fundamental breakdown of management and leadership.” Manuel Cortes, general secretary of the rail union TSSA, urged rail bosses to refund affected passengers. “This is not the time for private rail firms to hide behind the usual byzantine rules covering refunds. They will be paid millions for these delays by Network Rail and they must ensure that their frustrated passengers do not end up with just pennies after the horrendous delays of the past few days,” he said. On Sunday morning parts of the M62 near Liverpool were closed owing to icy conditions, and the Peak District was under a blanket of up to five inches of snow. Pete Williams, an RAC spokesman, said drivers should be prepared for black ice on Monday, and advised them to carry a shovel, warm blanket and flask of coffee in the car on their morning commute.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"For me, the thrill of history is often all about the erotics of not knowing", "content": "The year 2014 turned out to be the one when history got solved, once and for all. In September, the author Russell Edwards announced he had DNA proof that Jack the Ripper was a barber called Aaron Kosminski. The same month, Canadian marine explorers declared they had finally located HMS Erebus – the ship in which the British polar explorer Sir John Franklin was last seen entering Baffin Bay in 1845 in his attempt to navigate the Northwest Passage. And then, to cap it all, we learned this month that Richard III – he of the beetle-black pageboy bob – was actually nearer to blond. These are all mysteries that have kept history geeks going for generations. Well, perhaps not the one about the colour of Richard III’s hair – although it did make a lovely coda to the discovery of his skewwhiff skeleton in that Leicester car park in 2012. So to have these conundrums solved should result in a kind of ecstatic release, a rush of pleasure. Some philosophers call it the erotics of knowing. But actually, after that first climax of delight in being able to bang in the final bit of the historical jigsaw, a curious flatness sets in. For a few brief minutes, it’s extraordinary to be able to stare into a photograph of Kosminski and imagine what it might have been like if his was the last face you saw on Earth. Or to be finally able to start to understand what happened to Franklin’s expedition, a hubristic endeavour that ended up with his beleaguered crew snacking on each other once the tinned supplies ran out. But after that comes … simply the detumescence of having nothing left to learn. The fact is, we need our historical mysteries in order to keep the past fizzing with energy. It’s these tantalising, ticklish absences that pull us in as children to the idea that the olden days are not yet done and dusted. Instead, there’s the lingering possibility that we might be the ones to solve the riddle – or, in the case of Jack the Ripper, the crime. Until, that is, DNA came along and spoiled everything. My obsession with the Russian revolution started when I was eight years old and saw the film Anastasia on Saturday afternoon television. It’s the one in which Ingrid Bergman plays the Romanov princess, who at the time of the film’s making (1956) was believed to have survived the 1918 slaughter in Yekaterinburg and be living incognito in Europe. Bergman got an Oscar for it. I instantly became convinced that Anna Anderson, on whom the character of Anna in the film is based, was indeed the Princess Anastasia incognito. What’s more, I – a little girl from Sussex – would be able to prove it. I would travel to America where Anderson now resided and announce the good news to her myself. Together we would live as princesses really should. In the 1990s, DNA testing proved that Anna Anderson was an imposter. I was devastated and shocked; to be honest, I am still a bit in mourning. Which is why I’m not sure how many more solved mysteries I can bear. For whereas once upon a time it really was possible for an inspired amateur sleuth to solve historical mysteries that had left the experts scratching their heads for decades, what hope is there now? Unless you have the funds to run a state-of-the-art laboratory out of your spare bedroom, you’re pretty much obliged to leave history to the professionals, and watch the results on television. There is, though, one chink of hope. In October came the news that the identity of Jack the Ripper may not in fact be solved. There was a bungle, apparently, with the way they did the DNA testing. Don’t ask me for the details, but apparently the consequence is that the murderer is no more likely to have been Aaron Kosminski than thousands of others. The mystery is wide open again. At a stroke the past has become flooded with possibility; and the erotics of knowing – and not knowing – are back in play.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Peter Wilkinson: the man the unions say is driving the Southern rail strike", "content": "A casual observer might struggle to equate the man who appeared before the transport select committee looking like a French philosopher with the hatchet man whom unions accuse of driving the Southern rail strike. But Peter Wilkinson, whose shaven head, polo-neck and thick designer glasses transcend the usual faceless civil servant attire, has become the bogeyman at the Department for Transport for unions since he made an ill-advised speech in Croydon in February. All aboard the Southern chaos train: the commuters caught in a war on rails Read more Speaking to local rail users about train drivers, he said: “We have got to break them,” adding that those who resisted government plans should “get the hell out of my industry”. Wilkinson has since apologised to the committee both for his comments then and for subsequently misleading MPs about Southern’s franchise. He joined the DfT in the wake of the West Coast fiasco as franchising director with a brief to get the business of awarding rail contracts back on track. His appointment was greeted warmly by many in rail, when he was seen as a highly experienced rail professional giving some much-needed ballast to the department, having worked on both sides of franchising. A graduate of what was then Sheffield City Polytechnic (now Sheffield Hallam University) in industrial science, he became a general manager at London Underground before joining British Rail in the last years before privatisation. As an international rail consultant he built up a number of businesses, selling up equity to take over his departmental role. Now managing director, passenger services, he earns £265,000 a year. Wilkinson lives in London – near Borough market, of which he has been a trustee – during the week and flies to be with his wife and children in Vienna at weekends. Wilkinson, who describes himself as an urbanite who loves the mountains, used to race motorbikes, with a passion for the kind of speed and freedom few Southern commuters now enjoy. For all his controversial statements about drivers, Wilkinson also told Rail Professional magazine two years ago: “Frontline staff are the heroes of this industry, they’re the people who make it work, not people like me in head offices and places; this is a nonsense, we’re just petty bureaucrats.” • This article was amended on 16 December 2016.

{ "title":"St Lawrence Quartet review – gutsy playing can't lift Adams's new quartet", "content": "John Adams has now composed three works for the St Lawrence Quartet. One is a piece for quartet and orchestra, Absolute Jest, while the others are stand-alone string quartets, the second of which the St Lawrence brought to the Wigmore Hall for its UK premiere. In fact, String Quartet No 2 turns out to have more in common with the orchestral work than with its numbered predecessor. Beethoven provides the connection: where Absolute Jest mined the late quartets and Seventh Symphony for its thematic material, Adams’ new quartet ransacks two piano works – the A flat major sonata Op 110 and the Diabelli Variations – for the motives that generate its dense, busy textures. The references are curiously specific and inconsequential at the same time. Two of Adams’ most striking orchestral works of the 1980s, Grand Pianola Music and Harmonielehre, gleefully annexed the harmonies and rhetoric of 19th-century romanticism to create a wonderfully potent language that was all his own; but in the quartet, as in Absolute Jest, the Beethoven borrowings seem doggedly limiting rather than liberating. Haydn and Janáček provided the bookends for the premiere, with another quartet from Haydn’s Op 20 completing the programme. There was plenty of gutsy intensity in all the performances, but some moments of off-piste intonation too. And if Janáček’s First Quartet, known as the Kreutzer Sonata, had been included to add another link with Beethoven, the allusion to the latter’s violin sonata of that name in the quartet’s third movement is far more subtle and telling than anything in Adams’ much more self-conscious work.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Keynes would be disappointed by the way we work", "content": "In his comparison between 1936 and 2016 (A view from 1936: what Keynes would say now, 12 December), Larry Elliott omits to mention one of the major differences, and one that JM Keynes would surely have noticed as he speculated on its implications – namely the enormous increase in the productive power of labour and of the economy. Our priority should be to help people reduce their working hours (whether over a lifetime or weekly or daily) so that they can enjoy the leisure their productive capacity allows; today most people are still wage slaves, indeed more so than ever in the richest countries. Keynesian economics: is it time for the theory to rise from the dead? Read more Part of the issue is how we can enable this to take place in a way that is fair. At present, some cannot find any well-paying work, while others are overburdened with it. Technological change means that the goods and services demanded and available change over time, so that the more productive economy of today is producing different products from those of 1936, and consumers seek what is available today, but it remains true that without leisure we cannot enjoy the fruits of our labour. Leisure is not about lying around doing nothing but eating and drinking: a distinction between fruitful activity and work or labour undertaken to earn enough to live on is fundamental to this debate. How to achieve this end is by no means clear or easy, and certainly deserves debate and discussion, but it is disappointing that Larry Elliott is only concerned to use Keynes’s insights to allow even more people to be tied to the work economy, rather than liberated from it. This reminds us also that part of the debate needs to be about making the products and methods of production environmentally sustainable. Roger Gibbs Loughton, Essex • With another 100 years tucked inside his sarcophagus, Keynes might observe that we don’t do moderation very well. There is little point in governments kickstarting an economy, just to crash it again within a decade. While growth provides the momentum that keeps an economy going, it is the rate of growth that sustains democratic government. The economy is like a bottle of whisky; sipped daily the pleasure can last a long while; knock it back in half a hour and you’ll get a hangover. We seem to insist in growing the economy at a rate way beyond sustainability. The richer elements of society seem determined to drive the economy to maximise their individual gains, intending to hang on to those gains, while the less successful are expected to repay all accumulated debt when the economy tanks. Martin London Henllan, Denbighshire The illusion has been created that higher house prices represent an increase in real national wealth Christopher Padley • Judging by Larry Elliott’s account, a thawed-out Keynes would still target growth as the solution to our current economic problems. So, apparently, he would not yet have noticed the finite nature of our planet, nor accepted the need for environmental sustainability that this imposes. Actually, there are hints in his 1930 essay Economic Possibilities for Our Grandchildren that he may well have been a quicker learner than this. So perhaps it’s Larry who is not keeping up. Richard Middleton Crossmichael, Dumfries and Galloway • Keynes’s prediction in the 1930s was that as countries became wealthier, they would take this greater prosperity in the form of greater leisure rather than higher and higher incomes. Alas, this has not happened. Western society has been obsessed with earning more and more money, often through longer hours, rather than what we now call quality of life. Michael Franklin London Oh for the 1960s! People earned less but could afford more Read more • Patrick Collinson is right in his observation that behind the “lost decade of wage growth” there is a far worse situation (Oh for the 1960s! Take home less but buy more, Money, 10 December). The mismatch between the official figures and the apparent fall in living standards is explained by the omission from official inflation figures of house prices. Since 1963 house prices have inflated a total of about 5,000% while the official inflation figure is only 1,800%. Housing is such a high proportion of living costs that this is a very serious distortion indeed. Exactly why property prices are excluded is not clear, but the problem created goes far beyond hiding the truth of people getting poorer, bad enough as this is. The illusion has been created that higher house prices represent an increase in real national wealth, rather than the truth of money losing its purchasing power by the inverse of the increased price. This illusion permeates the banking industry and even the government’s management of the economy, with potentially disastrous results, some of which we have already seen. For example, it can be seen as the underlying cause of the 2008 banking crisis, with the banks lending into an illusory economy, far beyond what the real economy could afford.

According to witnesses at the closed session, he took full advantage. EU referendum: David Cameron hints vote could be held next summer Read more Floor 80, the secure top level of the European council building in Brussels, was reserved for the leaders. Room 80.4.5, wood-panelled and containing a large oval table, is where dinner takes place. The entry plaque tells you it is reserved for “chefs d’état ou gouvernement” – heads of state or government. No one in Brussels can remember a previous event where attention was lavished on a single national leader. Over chicken terrine, fillet of venison and spiced orange, the prime minister was granted 45 minutes to spell out to the other leaders why Britain is special, why it needs a new deal with the EU and how they can help him win a very difficult referendum. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Speaking privately, some leaders present have said they were moved. “Eloquent”, “persuasive” and “convincing” were some of the terms used to describe Cameron’s performance. It was a unique moment for Cameron, his biggest in Europe in six years in office. By all accounts, he performed more than well. There was no hectoring, no hammering the table, no tantrums recalling the one three weeks ago when Cameron told EU leaders that he needed his problems fixed on his terms and he needed it now. Following his outlining of his case, he was inundated with queries and objections for the best part of three hours. It was quite a grilling and Cameron impressed. “It was a bit like the teacher and the pupils,” said a witness to some of the exchanges. “Everyone wanted to ask him questions.” Twenty national leaders intervened to question Cameron and to state their positions on the UK wishlist for staying in the EU. But it was Angela Merkel, the German chancellor who enjoys a fearsome reputation for always being the best briefed person in the room at EU summits, who played the role of main synthesiser, offering explanations, summarising and reducing the problems to their essence, senior EU sources said. Towards midnight, Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European commission, told the rest of them that having listened to the debate he had several ideas aimed at finding by February legal fixes to the issues raised by Cameron, solutions that everyone could live with. “I’ve got a number of ideas that I want to work on over the next period of weeks,” he said. The Guardian view on the European summit: symbols before substance | Editorial Read more Cameron may have won plaudits all round for his political savvy, his presentational skills and the strength of his argument. But while the disputes at the heart of the British issue have softened, they are by no means resolved. As the dinner was closing, the whole session came close to collapse in what would have been a failure near enough ensuring Britain’s departure from the EU. Donald Tusk, chairing the summit and charged with crafting the compromises needed for a settlement by February, won a mandate to mediate deals in all four policy areas that Cameron spelled out in some detail. The fourth and final “bucket” is the most sensitive, entailing four years of benefits curbs for non-British EU citizens working in the UK. This is discriminatory and illegal under current EU law. Belgium, Greece, and Portugal staged a last-minute attempt at a coup, trying to have the fourth “bucket” dropped as unacceptable from the negotiations, participants in the dinner said. Had they succeeded, Cameron’s strategy would have been in tatters and a Tory party manifesto campaign pledge would not even be up for discussion. The three dissidents were overruled, but the incident highlighted the serious resistance to some of Cameron’s demands. Poland and Spain were also highly vocal critics, according to sources.Dalia Grybauskaite, the president of Lithuania, also remained unmoved by the Cameron charm offensive, denouncing the British tactics as “blackmail”. The resistance is far from limited to the issue of immigrant welfare curbs, although that remains the trickiest problem. Several countries voiced opposition to Cameron’s demand that national parliaments be given a greater say over EU legislation. A more serious problem may turn out to be George Osborne’s campaign to secure watertight guarantees curbing eurozone policymaking if London deems it counter to UK interests or skewing fairness in the EU’s single market in the eurozone’s favour. The German finance ministry, the French government and Mario Draghi, the powerful head of the European Central Bank – all formidable opponents – are worried that the British could engineer a deal that ties the eurozone’s policymaking hands, particularly in a crisis. But it is the discrimination that is at the core of Cameron’s proposal to penalise EU citizens working in Britain that remains the toughest nut to crack. In the absence of alternative ideas, Cameron told the dinner he would not take the proposal to freeze in-work benefits for EU citizens in the UK off the table. To win that, he needs to force a renegotiation of the Lisbon Treaty. There is no evidence this can happen soon. Steve Bell on David Cameron's EU negotiations – cartoon Read more Yet, according to participants and despite public statements to the contrary, Cameron told the dinner that he did not want to change the treaty. Enda Kenny, the Irish prime minister, said so three times on Friday. “The prime minister said ‘I’m not looking for a veto, I’m not looking for treaty change’. The prime minister was very clear in not looking for treaty change. He made that point himself,” said Kenny. Cameron’s lawyers, aides, and negotiators have been telling him for more than a year that his drive to curb benefits is illegal under current laws, only achievable through changing the EU treaty. That reality was once again made clear to Cameron on Thursday night by the leaders of France and Germany. Nonetheless, top policymakers in Brussels involved in the negotiations say that Cameron emerged as the dinner’s winner. For the first time since Britain’s negotiations with the rest of the EU got under way in July, the mood has shifted. The substance of an agreement remains misty. Confidence is growing that a deal can be struck that can keep the UK in the EU.",diasaster:0},

{ "title":"The Guardian view on the Rosetta space mission", "content": "Right now, a European spacecraft is circling a dark, icy object called comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko after a 10-year, 6bn-kilometre journey. The encounter between Rosetta and the comet, and the little lander Philae on the comet’s surface, happened because, in 1980, in the infancy of the European Space Agency, scientists met in Strasbourg to work out what such an agency might do. One recommendation was a landing on Titan, one of the moons of Saturn. Another was a comet rendezvous and an asteroid flyby. The Europeans partnered with Nasa to reach Saturn and in 2005 to drop a European lander called Huygens through Titan’s hydrocarbon clouds. The comet mission took a little longer. That too, was originally to be a partnership with the Americans. But in 1993 the ESA decided do it alone. Nobody who endorsed the project could be accused of doing so for short-term gain: some of its begetters had no hope of living to see it happen. It happened because people were prepared to think decades ahead and at distances of 673m kilometres, because that is where the spacecraft – which flew by two asteroids on its journey – made its rendezvous with the comet. Rosetta was designed to answer questions framed in the 80s, built with engineering experience gained in the 90s and fitted with technology perfected around the millennium: it is a testament to old technology. It is also a testament to cooperation. The ESA and eight separate nations backed the venture, and it involved more than 50 contractors from 14 European countries and the US. It is a triumph for the policy of open borders: scientists from Newcastle or Milton Keynes could go to Darmstadt in Germany or Frascati in Italy and form partnerships with colleagues from Max-Planck institutes or from the great French research universities. But most of all, it is a tribute to the long view, the willingness to embark on something that would deliver rewards to scientists not even born when it was first proposed. Nor is Rosetta an isolated example: the link between fossil fuel emissions and global warming became clear because of a set of meticulous daily measurements of carbon dioxide begun by one scientist in Hawaii in 1958: the Keeling curve traced the increasingly steep concentrations of the greenhouse gas and triggered the first real alarms about climate change. Research into the planet and its climate is now based on international partnerships, and these too benefit from the long view. The big problems faced by humanity – population growth, climate change, rising sea levels, precarious energy supplies, threats to food security, and biodiversity loss – are truly international, and won’t be solved in any one person’s lifetime. The ESA was launched in 1975 in a very different Europe, when Franco still controlled Spain, and a military junta had just given up power in Greece. At a time when politicians seem to want to close borders, constrain the movement of people and ideas, and encourage short-term commercial gain, the agency is a reminder of the power of cooperation, and Rosetta is a distant beacon for open borders and the long view.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Obiageli Ezekwesili: ‘When they took the girls, our government went under’", "content": "‘I couldn’t wrap my head around it,” says Oby Ezekwesili. “More than two hundred schoolgirls!” Eight months on, she still sounds incredulous as she recalls the moment she heard Boko Haram had kidnapped more than 300 students in north-eastern Nigeria. The mass abduction, during which extremists stormed the girls’ dorm at around midnight and forced the terrified teenagers on to trucks at gunpoint, propelled the remote village of Chibok into the global spotlight in April. The fact that it has stayed there is in large part due to the Bring Back Our Girls movement co-founded by Ezekwesili and three other Nigerian women. In the face of personal threats, they have remained driven by an abiding sense of outrage. Ezekwesili, a former minister and co-founder of anti-corruption group Transparency International, doubted the news at first. “I couldn’t believe it was true. I was tweeting to all the government handles, presidential aides, TV stations. Nobody replied. Everybody just went under,” she says. In the early aftermath, the official response – or lack of it – only compounded the horror. A presidential statement was more than two weeks in coming. The president’s wife weighed in, personally interrogating some protest leaders and dismissing the abduction as a plot to bring down her husband. The army, meanwhile, was forced to backtrack on a bewildering claim it had rescued all of the girls. In fact, around 50 of the girls had escaped by jumping out as they were driven towards Boko Haram’s forest training camps. The others, however, remained missing. Enraged by this apparent indifference, Ezekwesili and others organised a march to the national assembly in the capital, Abuja. Phalanxes of policemen barred the crowd of red-shirted protesters from approaching any official buildings, but the Bring Back Our Girls campaign was born. A Twitter hashtag of the same name caught the world’s attention, with Ezekwesili leading the online movement. “Since the beginning, they have tried to make us shut up,” says Ezekwesili, who in July tweeted to say that security operatives had tried to prevent her boarding a flight to London, where she was appearing on a BBC programme. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Boko Haram release a new video of kidnapped schoolgirls. Photograph: pixel8000/pixel 8000 All four of the movement’s co-founders stand out in a society with acute gender disparity. Alongside Ezekwesili, there is Hadiza Bala Usman, an opposition party member who brought the women together and made her name working with anti-corruption campaigners; lawyer and child rights advocate Maryam Uwais, whose scathing takedown of an MP’s arguments in favour of child marriage has entered local campaigners’ folklore; and Saudatu Mahdi, who runs a women’s rights group helping to strengthen anti-violence legislation. For her part, Ezekwesili has been sharpened for battle by two years in government, first under the department of mines, then later as education minister. Sporting a red beret over her close-cropped hair, she appears regularly at daily vigils in Abuja. But some have accused the women of using the movement as a platform to gain political capital. Official intimidation has never been far behind, and so toxic is partisanship in Nigeria that a significant minority still believe the abduction was an elaborate hoax to smear the government in upcoming elections that will probably be the most closely fought since a return to democracy in 1999. Ezekwesili shrugs off such theories. “The way our government handled the Chibok girls’ case goes beyond an election matter,” she says impatiently. “This is not a one-time issue we discuss over elections. We need to have a deeper conversation about what kind of a nation we want to be.” Less easy to dismiss are those who insist the movement has outlived its usefulness. “Today is day 241,” Ezekwesili counters, speaking slowly in an attempt to contain her obvious anger, “and the girls are still not back. If some people want to move on, it’s their right. “But they should remember we moved on when 69 secondary school boys were killed, and nothing changed,” she continues, her voice rising despite herself. “Now here we are, with many more children killed. Do our children now have to choose between getting an education and dying? Some of us cannot move on and accept that kind of society.” Even after a year of relentless attacks on students – 67 teenage boys were burnt alive in their dorms last year, marking the start of a wave of attacks that has since seen hundreds of pupils killed – Chibok stood out for the sheer scale and cruelty. Isis jihadis in Syria later referenced the Chibok girls when they captured and sold hundreds of Yazidi women to their fighters. This month, an estimated 200 women and children were kidnapped in Gumsuri, a village 30 miles from Chibok. The incident has largely sunk from view amid a growing catalogue of such horrors. Does Ezekwesili feel the pressure group has made progress? “Even if not many people are coming out to the streets or still tweeting, as long as one person is still holding out a candle for the kidnapped, we haven’t failed. That one voice can grow into millions eventually,” she replies. She falters slightly when asked what the government needs to do next, but no one can doubt her conviction when she describes the ongoing insecurity as an “open, festering sore”. For the grieving parents, the “Abuja Family” offers an alternative to a government that has failed in its basic duty to protect its citizens. “Maybe because we are poor, we don’t exist to other big men [politicians],” said an exhausted-looking Rebecca Yaga, whose daughter was among the kidnapped, as she attended a six-month commemoration march led by Ezekwesili. “There’s nothing for us to do but keep trying.” Ezekwesili says she is haunted by a father who told her some parents preferred to accept their daughters were dead than live in a tormented limbo. Previous hostages who have escaped the sect have spoken of rape and mutilation, and some are so traumatised they no longer remember their own names. Nonetheless, the father told her: “No matter who my daughter is when she comes back, she is my daughter and I want her back home.”",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"City Link underlines agency work problem", "content": "One of the City Link subcontractors mentioned in your report (26 December) had been working for the company through an agency for the past three years. It’s unclear when reports mention “nearly 3,000 staff” whether these are employees or agency staff. If politicians really wonder why the productivity of UK workers is so poor, why crucial skills are in such short supply, and why income tax revenues are unexpectedly low, they should look at the practice of long-term employment of subcontractors through agencies. Workers have the overhead of agencies taking a minimum of 15% of their wages. They pay far lower tax than employees, but the employer is paying no sick pay, no benefits and provides no training. Agencies are taking the money that used to go to the exchequer, workers have their benefits eroded and employers find it cheaper to bring in workers from abroad than to train up local staff. When the BBC talks about becoming more competitive by putting work out to tender, it is simply looking to replace trained staff by using companies that hire contractors for a particular role. No one will provide the training that has been the hallmark of the BBC. The same thing is happening in the NHS, and in schools and care homes up and down the country. Every second-rate humanities graduate is going into “recruitment” and the finances are normally concealed from both employers and employees. Labour and the unions should unite to fight the erosion of working conditions through agency working, to incentivise companies to employ and train staff directly, and to ensure an agency’s terms and conditions are clearly visible to all concerned.

{ "title":"On strike at 8,848 metres: Sherpa and the story of an Everest revolution", "content": "On 18 April 2014, a 14,000-tonne block of ice slid down the southern face of Mount Everest, killing 16 people. It was the mountain’s deadliest day, until just over a year later, when 22 died in the aftermath of the Nepalese earthquake. Thirteen of the men who died in 2014 were Sherpa, an indigenous ethnic group famed for their ability to withstand high altitudes. They had been finding their way through the Khumbu Icefall, one of Everest’s most dangerous passes. When the avalanche hit they were fixing a route so that tourists – some paying up to $75,000 to climb the world’s highest peak – could fulfil a dream. Sherpas abandon Everest climbing season after deadly avalanche Read more Not long before that, Jennifer Peedom had arrived to make a film about the Sherpas. She had been on three Everest expeditions; over the course of those visits, she had seen how the Sherpas’ role in getting tourists to the top had been played down, and she knew that there was a story to tell. But she couldn’t have known that she would be there as news of the disaster rolled in. She couldn’t have known that she would film as the Sherpas’ bodies were airlifted off the icefall, and watch as the locals channelled their shock and anger into something unheard of: a strike. Now, with her film, Sherpa, about to be released in cinemas, she acknowledges that it is not the film she intended to make – but argues that the story she emerged with is an essential one. “They are a people moving towards self-determination, which is a very natural thing,” says Peedom. “Sherpas are becoming better educated and going overseas. They’re getting climbing credentials and coming back [to the western expedition leaders] and saying: ‘I’m as good as you.’ That puts pressure on the status quo”. Facebook Twitter Pinterest The disaster prompted the Sherpas to demand better insurance, a rescue fund and eventually, the cancellation of the 2014 climbing season. Even before then, they were starting to chip away at the stereotypes that had plagued them since legendary climber Tenzing Norgay became one of the first people, along with Sir Edmund Hillary, to summit Everest in 1953. Norgay – genial, hard-working, always smiling – was portrayed by the press as Hillary’s loyal accomplice. The image of the happy assistant to the mountain-conquering Westerner stuck. Sherpa follows veteran guide Phurba Tashi, a Nepalese mountaineer with 21 ascents of Everest to his name, as he comes to the decision not to return to work in the wake of the tragedy. It was not an easy choice. His family didn’t want him to climb, but it is a lucrative job and he was loyal to his boss. Russell Brice is a celebrated New Zealand mountaineer and the owner-manager of the expedition company Himalayan Experience Ltd (Himex). In the film, Brice is feverishly trying to keep his business together, while facing a dilemma: how does he respect the Sherpas’ grief and keep them working to satisfy his clients? Everest: is it right to go back to the top? Read more “They say that there are two kinds of people that climb Everest: egomaniacs and dreamers,” says Peedom. “Some people can get caught up in the mystery and mystique of Everest. And other people just have it on their bucket list. These guys are busy people, ambitious people. They’re often wealthy people. I don’t judge them for that, but they do possibly avoid looking too deeply at the ethical issues, because it makes it more difficult.” Though the tourists she speaks to are generally sympathetic to the Sherpas, there are a few moments when their frustration reveals attitudes that are a little discomforting. During an emotional exchange one client pleads with Brice: “Can you not talk to their owners?” “The generous side of me would say perhaps he meant the expedition owners,” says Peedom. “But it did represent an attitude”. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Guides and climbers at Everest base camp in a film still from Sherpa Everest is a valuable asset to the Nepalese government. Permits cost $11,000 per person. Before the 2014 disaster there was little incentive to be too stringent over who got to climb (Peedom’s film shows queues lining up to summit the mountain). Meanwhile, the wealthier thrill-seekers expect a luxury service. Brice’s company are shown waking clients at base camp with hot towels and warm tea. In the evening they sit around on fur-lined camp chairs drinking lager and watching TV. All of this is hauled up the slopes by the Sherpas. Then there are the camera crews. With an expensive climb comes sponsorship and the need to record the ascent and publicise the backers. “There were three film teams on my expedition,” says Peedom. “Getting shots without camera people in them was a challenge. There were cameras everywhere. It feels like most people who are climbing Everest are having a film crew follow them.” Sherpa review – peril in the shadow of Everest Read more Since April’s earthquake, the Nepalese government have limited access to permits to experienced climbers, hoping that will address concerns about safety and overcrowding. But the Sherpas still face an uphill battle when it comes to changing outsiders’ perception of them. The recent Hollywood blockbuster Everest, which was filming while Peedom was on the mountain, has angered the community. Based on the 1996 disaster in which eight climbers died, the Sherpas say the film downplays their importance. “The Sherpas are really upset about it,” says Peedom. “Their role was a particularly big one in that year and that disaster. They were boiled down into one slightly weird character who wasn’t really representative of them. A lot of people were saying to me on Facebook: ‘Everest doesn’t show our side of the story.’” On returning from her shoot, Peedom had to re-pitch her film to her investors. They had been promised a documentary about a legendary Sherpa guide summiting Everest for a record-breaking 22ndtime. What she could deliver was what the Guardian’s initial review called “a workers’ rights film”. “The strike was unprecedented,” says Peedom. “That was a real line in the sand, and it will affect the future. The dynamic has shifted on Everest.” • Sherpa is on release in UK cinemas Facebook Twitter Pinterest Veteran guide Phurba Tashi in Sherpa A mountain of trouble: the roots of the Sherpas’ grievances 1920s: Sherpas accompanied the first British expeditions, led by George Mallory. Unclear of the climbers’ motives, some of the Sherpas apparently thought them treasure hunters. In 1922, when an avalanche struck and seven Sherpas died, the message that went down the mountain was “all whites are safe”. By the late 1920s Sherpas were already agitating for better conditions. 1930s: Tensions rose as Austrian expeditions saw the deaths of many more Sherpas on Nanga Parbat, another Himalayan mountain. 1953: The famous expedition by Tenzing Norgay and Edmund Hillary was led by a British army officer, John Hunt, who was a firm believer in hierarchy. Relations started acrimoniously when the Sherpas were not allowed beds at the British Embassy in Kathmandu, instead being forced to sleep on the floor. The Sherpas urinated in the road outside in protest. Once the team had scaled Everest – seen by some as a last crowning moment of the age of empire – controversy continued to surround the feat. In the international press, Norgay was painted as a noble servant, a smiling sidekick to the heroic Hillary. Accounts that had reported Hillary reaching the summit first were met with outrage by some in the Sherpa community. However, in an autobiography published in 1955, Norgay confirmed that he “stepped up after him”, but that the kerfuffle over who had scaled Everest first had tainted the memory. The dispute did not stop with the ascent – while Hillary received a knighthood, Norgay only got a medal. At the expedition’s 50th anniversary celebration, Norgay’s grandson accused the British establishment of unfairly treating his grandfather.

One report says that base camp became a sort of “alfresco courtroom”. 1972: Expedition leader Karl Herrligkoffer reportedly did not bring enough equipment for the Sherpas, who went on strike at base camp. He was forced to return to Germany for additional equipment. 2013: Arguments broke out between three Europeans and a group of Sherpas. The Europeans fled, saying they feared for their lives as an angry “mob” threatened to stone them. The Europeans had apparently dislodged some ice, which hit a Sherpa in the face. The situation became violent when one of the climbers allegedly called a Sherpa a “motherfucker”. Facebook Twitter Pinterest A rescue helicopter returns to Everest base camp after the 2014 avalanche 2014: In April an avalanche hit the Khumbu Icefall (a treacherous stretch that Sherpas often pass through 30 to 40 times per expedition, compared to a tourist climber’s two to four times) killing 16 people, 13 of them Sherpas. Afterwards many Sherpas refused to climb, calling for a strike. Struck afresh by the dangers of the job – the death rate for Sherpas on Everest between 2004 and 2014 was 12 times higher than for US military personnel in Iraq between 2003 and 2007 – this time they directed their anger not at climbers but at the Nepalese government. 2015: Sherpas were angered by the fact that the Hollywood blockbuster, Everest, a re-telling of Jon Krakauer’s Into Thin Air, massively played down the role they played in the 1996 disaster depicted.

{ "title":"How the divorce payments fiasco could do us all some good", "content": "Giving new life to the phrase “breaking news”, the software glitch in the Ministry of Justice’s 20-month-old downloadable Form E means that many of the financial calculations on which spousal maintenance payments may have been based have failed to take into account the debts of the maintenance-paying party. Michael Gove says sorry for MoJ divorce settlement software error Read more The knock-on is that judges have been inadvertently miscalculating maintenance payments upwards. Which in turn means that for those divorcing parties paying off credit cards and/or other loans, the financial demands of their legally ratified spousal support may not be affordable, thus adding to the carousel of joy that constitutes the majority of marital meltdowns. Because, let’s face it, more break-ups resemble unconscious unravelling (wine helps …) than they do Gwyneth and Chris’s much-derided, not to mention expensive-sounding, “conscious uncoupling”. So, y’know, well done, Form E software writers. As if, as Tammy told us, D-I-V-O-R-C-E isn’t H-E-double L enough. I’ve been through a divorce, and while it was emotionally bruising it was also 18 years ago, and therefore mercifully free of downloadable content. However, for many recently divorced parties who may have availed themselves of that handy-sounding Form E (figures suggest it may have been downloaded around 20,000 times), this kind of below-the-belt financial punch potentially adds considerable insult to injury. In the UK, many more women than men still initiate divorce – currently around 65%, down from 79% in the early 1990s. Meanwhile, over 80% of children of separated and divorced parents still live mainly with their mothers, and the higher earner – still predominantly a man – sucks up the bulk of the cost of the split. Paradoxically it is those (mostly, though not exclusively) men who, having downloaded the self-sabotaging Form E in, presumably, the pursuit of fairness and transparency, will have suffered the most – and who can, of course, be forgiven for this morning’s over-the-cornflakes air-punches; the news is not so good, of course, for their supported ex-spouses. Elsewhere, any UK-domiciled super-rich divorcees – strangers to Form E, I think it’s fair to assume – will simply carry on conjuring up those special sets of “accounts” specifically aimed at their ex-spouse’s divorce lawyers. However, one potentially positive outcome for all parties is that the Form E debacle highlights yet again the fact that Britain’s antediluvian laws continue to reflect a time in which divorce was a statistical anomaly and the exception to the marital rules rather than, increasingly, the norm – and that they need to change. For example, England and Wales do not allow so-called no-fault divorce; the only grounds for anything approaching “no-fault” divorce involves two years’ prior separation with consent – meaning that the non-petitioning spouse has to agree in writing. For a faster divorce, one of the parties still has to be blamed for “adultery”, “unreasonable behaviour” and so on. We need help getting divorced, not staying married | Bronwen Clune Read more This clearly skews the stats. For example, my ex-husband requested the divorce but wasn’t prepared to wait the two years (he wanted to remarry). As he demanded “a quickie”, I had to petition him for divorce on the grounds of his “adultery”. Statistically and legally, therefore, our divorce appeared to have been initiated by me. At the time, this legally sanctioned emotional untruth mattered to me. These days, of course, to say I have moved on from the experience would be to hugely understate my position. And yet, if I think about it, that legally sanctioned “untruth” still rankles. So, bring on more Form E-style debacles – if only so we may reach a place where divorce stops being perceived in extremis as either a peculiarly cruel and unusual punishment or as a lottery win when it’s simply a fact of 42% of all British couples’ marital lives. Meanwhile, congratulations to the family law specialist who spotted the software glitch, Nicola Matheson-Durrant, who is neither a solicitor nor a barrister but a McKenzie Friend – the delightfully titled lay experts to whose advice all litigants in court are entitled. As far as I am aware Matheson-Durrant is married and has kids but has also been divorced. As an expert, then, it’s fair to say she’s ticking all the boxes – including those in Form E. Previously overlooked by every “solicitor, barrister or judge in the whole of the UK … this form has been used in training so it will also have been seen by paralegals, university law departments and the Law Society …” With this sort of efficiency, we may still be some way off England and Wales legalising “no-fault” divorce.",diasaster:0},

My partner and I have a similar problem after receiving a bill for £2,213.36 for surfing the net and looking at emails – we don’t use it for downloads or watching films or TV. I had asked BT what would be the best dongle to use as we were moving house – and temporarily into a caravan – while waiting to sign contracts. After just one month the dongle stopped working. BT said the account had been put on hold in mid-August as we were over our limit and had to pay £1,600. We’ve written to BT and to date have only received an email confirming its cancellation of the account in November and demanding that we settle the bill of £2,213.36. SH, Higham, Kent We have come across situations when account holders say they have not received texts or (unwisely) chosen to ignore them, but you did receive and respond to them, and contacted BT to buy another 5GB for £52.50. But by this stage you must have already run up a bill of hundreds of pounds. Although the standard BT texts give customers the chance to choose “a more cost-effective option”, they do not state the extra costs they are now incurring. A BT spokesperson said: “We would like to apologise for the issues surrounding a business mobile broadband data bill during the house move. SH contacted us in August after receiving several text messages alerting her that she had gone over her data usage, and we increased the data bundle to 5GB as requested. When that was used up we tried contacting the customer on their alternate telephone number but were unsuccessful. If a customer goes over their data usage on business mobile broadband they are charged at 10p per megabyte and we are working towards including the price in our alert messages going forward. We are liaising with SH to resolve the issue.” In our view, a resolution should involve slashing this bill almost completely. What BT has not explained is why individuals are still getting whacked with enormous bills that bear no relation to the cost of providing the service. Because these are business accounts there could be thousands of account holders who don’t check properly and just quietly pay the extra data costs. We welcome a move towards clearer information for customers on cost, but think the concept of a limit or a cap – which implies a cut-off of service rather than continuation at a higher rate – might be misleading.

{ "title":"Be a smart phone user – follow our five steps to cheaper mobile bills", "content": "Mobile phone users in the UK are wasting about £160 a year by being on the wrong contract, according to a new report. Furthermore, 90% of those with a mobile are losing out this way. Overpaying subscribers tend to either be on contracts that give them more minutes and data than they use, or on contracts with limits they regularly exceed, which means they rack up extra charges each month. The latter group tend to be the biggest overspenders. Having analysed 400 “representative” contracts, the consumer data firm ctrlio (it’s pronounced “controleo”) says we could be collectively wasting £6bn a year. It named EE as the worst mobile provider for “contract fit”, while independent provider giffgaff was the company with most customers on the right deal. In short, the survey found that if you’re on an 18- or 24-month deal that has expired it’s likely you are overpaying each month. Here’s an action plan to make sure you avoid this scenario. 1. Check your real usage The ctrlio report was issued to promote the firm’s bill comparison service, which it says will work out the best contract for you. It is similar to a rival service offered by another firm featured in Guardian Money in the past, Bill Monitor. Both firms ask for your provider account details and password. They will then access your phone account and examine your recent bills to come up with your actual monthly usage – and the best deals to switch to, for which they will earn a commission. Check both firms (it doesn’t take long) to see whether the results tally, and then compare the deals on offer. 2. Consider going sim-only If you carry on using an existing handset after a contract expires you could be £246 a year better off if you switch to a sim-only deal, ctrlio says. Once you have an unlocked handset there is nothing to stop you replacing the existing sim card with one from a cheaper rival. You can still keep your existing number. There are some great sim-only deals from £7.50 a month which will be more enough for light users. Money particularly likes giffgaff and Tesco Mobile, both of which operate on the O2 network. There are a range of deals, but for £7.50 you get 250 minutes of calls and 500MB of data, which should be enough to cover basic email and occasional internet usage – but if you are a YouTube fan you’ll soon bust that limit. For heavier data users Tesco has a sim-only deal with 2GB of data and 750 minutes of calls for £12.50 a month. 3. Ask your home phone provider If you are an existing TalkTalk, Virgin or BT home phone/broadband customer, they all have competitive sim-only deals. BT’s deal offers 200 minutes and 500MB of data for just £5 a month, while TalkTalk is offering 250 minutes and 650MB per month for just £3.95 – both come with a 12 month contract. Virgin Media customers can get similar deals, the pick being its £8 per month sim with 1,250 minutes of calls and 500MB of data. Sky doesn’t currently offer such deals, but will do so in 2016, it says. 4. Haggle with your provider Ring them up and to tell them you are moving to, say, Tesco Mobile and you may find a much better deal is mysteriously offered up, particularly if you are out of contract. The big players rely on the fact that many customers want to upgrade their handset every 18 months; if you’re not happy playing that game, do a deal. If your existing provider can’t come close to what is being offered by Tesco, then make the move. 5. Consider an outright purchase It can be cheaper to buy a phone outright with no contract from the likes of Carphone Warehouse and opt for a sim-only deal. Decent smartphones that do nearly everything you need can now be bought for just £70-£90 depending on what you want. Why tie yourself to a £42-a-month contract for two years to get an iPhone 6s when you can buy a decent 4G smartphone for £99 and get a £7.50 monthly sim?",diasaster:0},

Brian May and Roger Taylor do quite a lot of that in Queen: From Rags to Rhapsody (BBC4), which tells the story of their rise from nothing to world domination and that song. “I remember being on the train with Fred,” says Roger. “Can you believe, he did use to travel on the train? Hated every second of it.” “It was tough,” remembers Brian. “We were all students, we’d run out of student grant, I was actually teaching in a comprehensive school to make ends meet.” Oi! You were lucky to get a grant at all; these days students have to pay it back. As for the teaching in a comprehensive school, some people do that for ever, to make ends meet (as well as because they want to, you’d hope). Roger remembers he and Freddie Mercury had a stall in Kensington Market. “We used to flog old Edwardian scarfs, and Russian fox furs … don’t think Brian would have liked that very much.” Ha, that is quite funny, May being not just a stargazer, but an animal rights activist.

They mainly got along pretty well. Freddie Mercury was extraordinary, and his tragic death obviously changes everything, but until then – which is the focus of this documentary – it’s a story of a band on a Soyuz trajectory (Don’t Stop Me Now was playing in Major Tim’s rocket as he took off, inevitably). I enjoyed the 10cc one the other day more. Well, there was a proper split, a wedge driven right down the middle. And, though in some ways similar, I like the music better.

{ "title":"George Osborne public spending plan ‘a political suicide note’, says David Laws", "content": "The Liberal Democrats have made their boldest step yet to distance themselves from Conservative economic policy when David Laws, a former deputy to George Osborne, described the chancellor’s public spending plans to 2020 as a political suicide note. They were so severe, he said, that they made Thatcherism look like a policy devised by Tony Benn. The language deployed by Laws is startling since he is seen as being on the right of the Liberal Democrats and for a short period was Treasury chief secretary when the 2010 spending review was prepared. At one point when not in government he called for public spending to be cut back to 35% of national income. But in an intervention on Sunday, he said the Conservatives had made a politically catastrophic error in trying to draw up rightwing economic dividing lines that will require cuts in some Whitehall departments of a quarter. Conservative voters who value the armed forces, police and prisons will be worried by the “mind-boggling” consequences of the cuts, Laws said. He predicted “panic” in the Tory ranks and more jockeying for position among senior ministers who want to replace David Cameron if opinion polls do not show his support picking up. Laws accused Osborne of a “huge policy and strategic blunder” on a par with Michael Foot’s 1983 manifesto – a byword for electoral disaster that was dubbed “the longest suicide note in history”. Laws predicted that the Tory plans would “unravel” under the scrutiny of an election campaign or would prove to be a “rightwing version of Michael Foot’s manifesto”. Laws will face charges of hypocrisy since he was one of the architects of the original austerity package in 2010, but with the Liberal Democrats now primarily in a battle to hold on to seats where the party’s chief challengers are Tories, its strategic goal must be to depict the Tories as extreme. That way they can hope to win over centrist Conservatives and secure Labour supporters’s tactical. Laws said: “This will be seen to be a very extreme and very rightwing suicide note because all those people who care about the education service, about the police, about the armed forces … will see that the plans they have put forward are hugely damaging and dangerous.” He added: “In order to deliver this scale of savings you are talking about having to find cuts in the unprotected budget of around a quarter in the next parliament.” Even then the Conservatives will only achieve their goals if they find welfare cuts on a scale that “would hugely increase the levels of poverty in the country”. The Liberal Democrats have – like the Tories – signed up to clearing the deficit in day-to-day spending in 2017-18, but say this must be achieved by some tax rises, and not, as the Tories plan, only though spending cuts. Nick Clegg’s party does not support the £12bn of welfare cuts proposed by Osborne in the first two years of the parliament. The Liberal Democrats, like Labour, would allow extra borrowing for capital investment, and unlike the Tories would not seek to achieve a surplus on the current and capital account surplus by the end of the next parliament. Chris Leslie, shadow chief secretary, dismissed Laws’ intervention, saying: “Nobody will fall for this desperate attempt by the Lib Dems to distance themselves from the government they are part of. “Two years ago David Laws called for deep cuts to public services to reduce the size of the state to 35 per cent. “And Nick Clegg and Danny Alexander signed off spending plans in the autumn statement that would do just that and take public spending back to a share of GDP last seen in the 1930s.”",diasaster:0},

If this helps anyone come to terms with it and deal with it and helps then I think it is worth doing.” Police estimated that between 1,000 and 1,500 people were at the vigil. The victims of the crash were remembered at Christmas services across the city, with candles lit and prayers said for all those affected by the tragedy. Scotland’s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, intends to personally thank those who dealt with the incident. A Scottish government spokesman said: “The first minister extends her sincere condolences to the families and friends of those who died in George Square. She also wishes a speedy recovery to those who are still being treated in hospital. “Our immediate priority is to allow health professionals to continue to care for people who were injured, and to give those who lost loved ones the time and space to grieve. The first minister is extremely grateful to the health workers and first responders who dealt so admirably with this difficult tragedy. She intends to thank them personally over the coming days and weeks.”",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Houzz: the website that speaks the language of home improvement", "content": "Six years after they moved to the United States from Israel, Adi Tatarko and her husband Alon Cohen were finally able to buy their own home in Silicon Valley. The problem, however, was that they could not tell the architects and designers they talked to what they wanted done to their four-bedroom property from the images that were in their head. “We didn’t have the right terminology,” says Tatarko. “Most of us are not professionals from the industry. We are not designers or architects or contractors, so when people came to our house and asked us, ‘Would you like to have … coffered ceilings here?’, we looked at them and said, ‘What?’ We started digging in books and magazines and reading a lot and trying to educate ourselves but the whole process was really difficult.” From that frustration has emerged Houzz, a website and app that acts as a hub for home improvement, featuring seemingly countless pictures of the insides and outside of homes and flats, which can be flicked through until something catches the eye. The rapid rise over the past five years of the Californian company has led it to an estimated value of more than $2bn (£1.3bn), with Tatarko and Cohen now listed among the tech sector’s power couples. The galleries of living rooms, gardens and extensions are mostly put up by architects, builders and interior decorators. The site includes details of lamps, beds and tables used to create the effect – in effect, the portfolios of home improvement professionals. On the other side is the Houzz “community” of 25 million users, who use the galleries to find what they are looking for, or to link up with professionals. The site is designed to bridge the gap between homeowners frustrated at being unable to explain what they want and professionals struggling to interpret clients’ ideas. “The first users of Houzz were 20 parents from our kids’ school, who we talked to and we said it would be wonderful if we could talk to each other and share ideas, and see ideas and talk to professionals and have it all very visual and have the technology,” says Tatarko, who started Houzz in the San Francisco Bay area in 2009. “Professionals were also frustrated. They said, ‘Well you’ – pointing to us as homeowners – ‘you think that you see a picture in a magazine and then you call us and you want to have something similar. Unfortunately what you see in the picture cost somebody hundreds of thousands of dollars but you say that you only have a $20,000 budget. Or what you see there is meant to work in a very big house but you have a very small house – that is not going to work.’ They said somebody needs to educate homeowners because their expectations are not realistic. “We wanted to remove the barriers between homeowners and great design, and make the whole process way more fun and productive by applying technology.” Tatarko and Cohen had no marketing budget and their business was running on only $2,000 a month, but the idea soon spread by word of mouth outside of California and across the US. The couple built a network of professionals and users before they decided in the autumn of 2010 to commit to the business fully themselves, hire staff and seek investment to expand. By 2013, more than one-third of the users were from outside the US. A London office was opened last summer, and the UK network now numbers 15,000 tradespeople, designers and architects, and 1.5 million users. Algorithms dictate what style of room and furnishings appear when users search galleries on the site, while there are tags to identify and buy pieces of furniture or pinpoint the type of paint used in a room. Typically, professionals such as builders or lighting specialists upload their own pictures, but householders who have had their own home renovated also put up galleries of the finished project. Users create “ideabooks” of their favourite posts and can ask questions about, for example, where a desk was sourced or what type of wood was used. After the US, Houzz expanded to Australia, Germany and France as well as the UK – adapting to cultural differences along the way, such as swapping “elevator” for “lift”. Tatarko and Cohen now intend to move into Japan. “I can see something that someone is doing in Australia and say, ‘This is exactly what I want to do here, and I don’t care that nobody did it in my neighbourhood before – as long it is doable, I am going to do it,’ ” says Tatarko. An unexpected side-effect of the international expansion, she adds, is that architects and other professionals are getting jobs outside of their own country. From being run on a shoestring by the couple from their home, Houzz has attracted in excess of $200m in investment. Revenues come from advertising by home furnishing and improvement companies, professionals registering their services, and the commission from sales of items such as lamps and chairs. Despite some of the elaborate houses on the site, Tatarko says that Houzz aims to cater for all types of home decorator, from those trying to renovate a mansion to someone who is fitting out a one-bedroom flat on a modest budget. The philosophy of the company dictates that it stays away from celebrity homes and focuses on realistic ideas about what people can do to their properties. Houzz-eye view of Britain Unsurprisingly, when British users went to the site, they tended to type in “small” as a reference term, reflecting the more limited space available compared with homes in the US. Adi Tatarko says that the trend for building down into basements, which has caused neighbour disputes because of the disruption involved, is clear in some of the content appearing on Houzz from the UK. “Because there is not enough space, people are either going up or down and trying to add to basements, or going up the top. But sometimes they do have a little space in the backyard.” Other trends in the UK, she says, include “glass box” extensions – sometimes featuring glass walls and ceilings.",diasaster:0},

{ "title":"Insurance rip-offs are a Nationwide problem", "content": "First the bad news. When I promised last week to name and shame the companies accused of overcharging loyal customers for home insurance, I didn’t think it was going to feature Nationwide, usually one of the better behaved financial services providers. The good news is that Nationwide has relented, in one case at least – although like other insurers it is kicking back against accusations of rip-off pricing. The case of a retired London professor, John Stanworth, is among the most egregious. He lectured on business ethics and social responsibility, one reason he stayed with member-owned Nationwide for 40 years. Nationwide’s home insurance is provided by Direct Line, which in recent years raised Prof Stanworth’s premium to £1,100 for cover he could find elsewhere for about £300. Worse, when he made a £3,850 claim for flood damage, the loss adjusters reimbursed £400. Don’t be a home insurance frog – make the leap to a different policy Read more Happily, after our intervention this is now being paid in full. “The lady that rang was charming – not just the usual sales team charming but like someone with the self-confidence that comes from closeness to power. She said one of my letters had ended up on her chief executive’s desk and he had said ‘pay it’,” says Prof Stanworth. He was thankful for our intervention but wonders why it should need the help of a newspaper to obtain an entitlement he had paid for, and handsomely so. John Loader, a reader from North Yorkshire, has been with Nationwide in one form or another since it was the Maidenhead building society in the 1960s. In 2009 it charged less than £600 for his insurance; by this year it had soared past £1,000. When he got a quote from Churchill it was £382. “This product bearing their name is so out of kilter with all the other products I have with them … I was very surprised a mutual like Nationwide would do this,” he says. But Nationwide firmly disagrees. It said the Churchill comparison was not valid as its policy included unlimited liability on buildings cover. That is fair, although whether it really explains the vast gulf in quotes is a moot point. I’ll name the other companies in the coming weeks. It is scandalous how some customers have been treated, and in the same way they slowly boiled these insurance “frogs”, I’m quite happy to keep the pot boiling on reader stories. A football prediction … Germany are favourites to win Euro 2016, followed by France. But I already know who the real winners are: Ryanair. England’s first game will be against Russia in Marseille on 11 June. Almost immediately after the dates and locations were announced, Ryanair’s prices leapt, and it is now charging close to £400 for a weekend return. Go a couple of weekends later and it’s just £85. For a while you could beat Ryanair at its own game by flying into Marseille from other locations in Europe. Its Brussels-Marseille flights remained at €70 return for a short period after the tournament dates were announced, but have since raced past €200. The hotels are no less greedy: £219 will bag you the last hotel with rooms in Marseille, a two-star joint with terrible reviews on TripAdvisor and which usually charges around £40. “Merci, mais plus jamais,” says one reviewer. Northern Ireland fans fare similarly, with flights to the Ukraine game in Lyon going for £472 on British Airways, and they’re not even direct. Republic of Ireland supporters, some of the keenest followers of their team in Europe, will hand Aer Lingus more than double the normal price to get to Bordeaux to watch the big clash against Belgium. I was in Marseille last summer and apart from the Vieux Port the rest of the city fully lives up to its grimy reputation. Even the airport terminal used by Ryanair is like a decaying Naafi hut. The idea of spending £400 for a flight and £219 a night for some hotel hellhole mystifies me. And that’s before some tout adds a 1,000% mark up to the ticket price. But then the equation between what football fans invest and what they get in return is one of the eternal mysteries of personal finance.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Adele tickets partner Songkick raises new $10m funding round", "content": "The British company that helped to prevent 18,000 touts from buying tickets for Adele’s 2016 tour has raised $10m of funding to continue developing its technology. Songkick raised its latest funding round from Len Blavatnik’s Access Industries, the investor that owns Warner Music Group and has a significant stake in music streaming service Deezer. The company has now raised more than $42.6m since its launch in 2007 as a website enabling fans to track upcoming concerts from their favourite musicians. Songkick has since expanded into ticketing, including working with artists to sell tickets direct to their fans, rather than through established ticket retailers. In June, Songkick merged with fellow British startup CrowdSurge, which had worked with artists including Paul McCartney, Ellie Goulding and John Legend on these kinds of partnerships. “In 2015, we have continued to expand our artist ticketing business, with more than three times growth across Europe. We are now ticketing one out of every three concerts in London and have helped artists sell tickets across 48 countries in 2015,” wrote co-chief executives Ian Hogarth and Matt Jones in a blogpost. Songkick’s recent partnership with Adele was its highest-profile deal yet, selling more than 165,000 tickets for her upcoming UK and European tour, having pre-registered more than 500,000 fans on the star’s website. The company then blocked more than 18,000 “known and likely” touts from buying tickets, using technology that Songkick plans to develop with the new funding round. “It’s very much about the technology, we have been quietly been building and testing some new proprietary technology that we feel could be impactful for artists and fans around the scale of ticket touting that goes on,” Hogarth told the Guardian. “We have a very exciting product map there.” Security will be a priority too: Songkick came under fire after the first day of Adele ticket sales, after a privacy scare in which some fans reported being able to see other people’s personal details when trying to check out of the online store. Songkick apologised at the time. “At no time was anyone able to access another person’s password, nor their payment or credit card details (which are not retained by Songkick),” said the company in a statement blaming “extreme load” for the problem. Jones said that the bug was fixed on that first day. “A couple of people blew it out of proportion,” he said. “We sold another round of European sales, so we want to put that to bed.”",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Almost half of Britain's private wealth owned by top 10% of households", "content": "Britain’s richest households have pulled further ahead of the rest of the population as house prices have accelerated, with the top 10% now owning almost half of the country’s £11.1tn total private wealth. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the average household was worth £225,100 in 2012-14, when it carried out its latest survey of the country’s assets. Since the previous survey two years earlier, the top tenth of households had seen a 21% increase in their wealth, including property and shares. That was three times as fast as the increase over the same period for the poorest half of households, who saw their wealth rise by 7%. Distribution of UK wealth Distribution of UK wealth. It left the top tenth of households owning 45% of total wealth, while the bottom half were left to share just 9%. The poorest 1%, meanwhile, owned just 0.05% of wealth. Inequality of wealth tends to be exacerbated when the prices of assets such as property and shares are rising rapidly, and has become an increasingly controversial political issue. Labour advocated a “mansion tax” on the most valuable homes in its 2015 manifesto. The TUC general secretary drew the contrast between the sharp increase in wealth for the richest households and the squeeze in earned income in recent years as wage growth remained weak after the financial crisis. “The government must reshape the economy to address the UK’s over-reliance on property and financial investments,” Frances O’Grady said. “Future growth must be built on the firm foundation of higher wages in both the public and private sectors, and investment in skills and industry.” The shadow Treasury minister, Rebecca Long-Bailey, said: “This Tory government has done nothing substantive to tackle the growing problem of wealth inequality in our country, in fact by cutting inheritance tax for a wealthy few at the same time as cutting universal credit for working families they are only making matters worse.” Shadow chancellor John McDonnell has recruited the French economist Thomas Piketty – who advocates taxing wealth more heavily to prevent inequality running out of control – to his panel of economic advisers. The ONS asked Britain’s families about their savings, shared portfolios and housing wealth. They found that the top 10% owned at least £1,048,500 in assets while the bottom 10% owned £12,600 or less.

Illustration: ONS Duncan Exley, director of the Equality Trust, said: “When such a huge chunk of the country’s wealth is found in the hands of so few people, it is clear something has gone terribly wrong. Aside from the disproportionate power this provides the richest, we know this vast inequality also weakens our economy and damages our society.” The ONS found that private pension portfolios accounted for 40% of households’ total wealth, with the richest 10% of households having a £749,000 pension pot, compared with just £2,800 for households in the least wealthy half of the population. It said the rising value of pension portfolios had been an important cause of the 18% increase in aggregate wealth over the two-year period between its surveys. Asset prices have recovered strongly in recent years, helped by the continuing low level of global interest rates. The Bank of England is yet to increase borrowing costs from the record low of 0.5% they reached in March 2009. Inequality of wealth in Britain has a clear regional dimension, the ONS data showed, with wealth heavily concentrated in London and the south-east, where the housing market has bounced back strongly since the slump that followed the global financial crisis. Average household wealth in the north-east, at £150,000, was less than half of that in the south-east, where it was £342,400.

{ "title":"John Freeman obituary", "content": "John Freeman, who has died aged 99, was a chameleon: he was by turns an advertising copywriter, an army major and war hero, a Labour politician and minister, a dangerously incisive television interviewer, whose Face to Face series made a considerable mark, an editor of the New Statesman, a senior diplomat, a TV executive and a professor of international relations – to all of which roles he brought charm and notable efficiency. When he had made a success of each job, he simply moved on. After serving as a Desert Rat – a member of the 7th Armoured Division in North Africa – in 1945 he won the parliamentary seat of Watford for Labour. His maiden speech, about the rebuilding of postwar Britain, moved Winston Churchill to tears. Freeman quickly became a junior minister and was tipped by some as a future party leader. But in 1951 he resigned his office and in 1955 left politics altogether to begin his serial march through careers. Freeman was born in London to Horace, a chancery barrister, and Beatrice (nee Craddock), who were both Liberals. He was educated at Westminster school and Brasenose College, Oxford, and then worked in advertising (1937-40). After his distinguished army service in the second world war – he was appointed MBE in 1943 – he was elected in the Labour landslide that followed the end of the conflict in Europe. He was one of the youngest of the new wave of largely middle-class MPs to be pushed into prominence under Clement Attlee (and by the end of his life the last surviving member of that parliament). He held ministerial posts in both the War Office and the Ministry of Supply but resigned his office in 1951, along with Harold Wilson and Aneurin Bevan, over social service cuts. The government fell only months later. Bevan once said of him: “He is the only one among us who is really dangerous. There is something unknown in him. He could turn out to be the man from Saturn.” In return, Freeman said he loathed the pursuit of power – and most of the people who pursued it. From 1951 he was a journalist with the New Statesman, and established himself as a BBC TV interviewer of depth. His Face to Face series (1959-62) dealt with subjects as varied as King Hussein of Jordan, Henry Moore, Dame Edith Sitwell, Martin Luther King and Karl Jung. His trademark was his refusal to appear on camera himself, always interviewing with the camera behind his back. His interviews were sometimes regarded as insensitive, especially by the quieter standards of the day. He explored the insecurities of the comedian Tony Hancock and the TV panellist Gilbert Harding, who confessed in tears to being shattered by his mother’s death. Freeman walked regularly the six miles to his office from his Hampstead flat in north London to keep himself in trim and alert. At the New Statesman he was assistant editor, deputy editor and finally, in 1961, editor. He reshaped the magazine but was not a radical. Nonetheless, after four years he left it with a larger circulation than he had inherited. Freeman then morphed into a diplomat: Labour returned to power in 1964, and he secured the post of British high commissioner to India (1965-68), and then British ambassador to Washington (1969-71). A more hands-on task presented itself when the broadcaster David Frost asked him to become managing director and chairman of the troubled London Weekend Television (1971-84). He went in and rescued it from disaster, although he had had no previous experience of running a company of any kind. His final role came as professor of international relations at the University of California, Davis (1985-90). Despite his importance and success in numerous fields, Freeman always avoided the limelight. When, in the 1980s, the writer and broadcaster Hugh Purcell wanted to write a biography, Freeman refused to help. He was married four times: in 1938 to Elizabeth Johnston; following their divorce, in 1948 he married Margaret Kerr, who died in 1957, leaving him a stepdaughter, Lizi, whom he adopted. In 1962 he married the Panorama producer Catherine Dove, with whom he had three children, Matthew, Tom and Lucy. He and Catherine divorced, and in 1976 he married Judith Mitchell, with whom he had two daughters, Victoria and Jessica. He also had relationships with the Labour politician Barbara Castle and the novelist Edna O’Brien. He is survived by Judith and his six children. Dennis Barker Anthony Howard writes: John Freeman was the most successful editor the New Statesman ever had, though not the most illustrious – that title properly properly belongs to Kingsley Martin. When he came to the job, after a patient 10-year apprenticeship served under Martin, sales were falling – the old formula of pacific socialism and optimistic sentiment had begun to look rather faded. He rapidly reversed the trend, leaving behind him four years later a circulation over 90,000: those were the days. It was, in some ways, an improbable achievement. Freeman was never an easy writer – it would sometimes take him as much as two hours to compose a single paragraph for his London Diary. But what he lacked in fluency or flair he more than made up for in administrative and editorial efficiency. The New Statesman of his day was run as a tight ship, with Freeman every inch the captain. He set himself high standards and expected, and exacted, them from his staff – whom he would always, however, loyally defend in the face of any outside criticism. Although his brief reign in the chair did not at all foreshadow his own later swing to the right – he had become a Tory voter long before his death – he did decisively alter the magazine’s traditional appeal and approach. Soft-heartedness went out and hard-headedness came in, with adjectives such as “well-balanced” and “judicious” replacing familiar epithets such as “outrageous “ or “unforgivable”, even in the magazine’s then front-page leader column. An old ally of Harold Wilson’s, he placed the New Statesman firmly behind the new Labour leader’s efforts to modernise the party and turn it into “the natural governing party of Britain”. (As a former Bevanite, his relations with Wilson’s predecessor, Hugh Gaitskell, were a good deal more distant.) Three months after Wilson became prime minister in October 1964, Freeman left journalism, never to return to it. During his period as ambassador to Washington he was once sounded out for the Times – but, though he later confessed that he would have taken the job had it been offered, nothing came of it. That the question should even have been broached demonstrated how far, by the late 1960s, the establishment had come to regard him as one of its own. In his public persona Freeman certainly fitted the part of an instinctive insider. Although he was a famous TV performer, he shrank from celebrity status. Whether as politician, journalist, diplomat or boardroom executive he never lost his military bearing and aloof demeanour. He always shied away from personal publicity – sometimes in his private life with good reason – and few ever penetrated the immaculate front he presented to the world. At the height of his Face to Face fame, a photographer once came to take pictures of him in his New Statesman office. He snapped away conscientiously until Freeman, who had been transacting routine editorial business while the process went on, finally exclaimed in some exasperation: “Surely, you must have got enough by now.” The photographer conceded that that was probably the case, but then rashly added: “You see, I was hoping to catch you in an unguarded moment.” “Ah,” replied Freeman, “there are, I fear, very few of those.” Delivered with the thinnest of smiles, it betrayed an element of self-knowledge, even self-mockery, that it would be hard to improve upon. • John Freeman, politician, diplomat, editor and interviewer, born 19 February 1915; died 20 December 2014 • Anthony Howard died in 2010",diasaster:0},

The plane seated 180 but only 155 passengers were on board, allowing a few to stretch their legs into empty adjacent seats. The flight was scheduled to arrive in Singapore about three hours later. The sky was cloudy, the air warm. Indonesian authorities said that, at 6.13am, the pilot - an Indonesian man named Iriyanto - contacted air traffic control in Jakarta with a request: the plane was cruising at 32,000ft over the Java sea and was approaching some nasty weather. Could he rise to 38,000ft to avoid a storm cloud? Then, mysteriously, the captain went silent. The flight was last seen on radar at 6.16am and was gone a minute later, the Indonesian acting director general of transportation Djoko Murjatmodjo told reporters. Iriyanto had not sent a distress signal, he said. AirAsia’s chief executive, the Malaysian-British entrepreneur Tony Fernandes, tweeted that he was en route to Surabaya. Fernandes is also chairman of the English Premier League football club QPR. On its Facebook page, AirAsia Indonesia wrote: “We are very upset over this incident. As we are coordinating with all relevant authorities in order to determine the cause of this incident.” The company added that it would “provide full support in line with the process of investigation”. AirAsia changed its bright red logo to grey on social media sites. And observers found themselves asking the same disquieting question they had already asked once this year: in a world of satellite tracking, how can a passenger jet simply disappear? Furthermore, AirAsia is headquartered in Malaysia, home also to Malaysia Airlines, which has lost two planes in 2014 – one in the southern Indian Ocean, and another, four months later, shot down over Ukraine. The Airbus A320-200 that took off on Sunday morning did not show any obvious problems. According to Airbus, it had safely logged 13,600 flights since it came off the assembly line in October 2008. AirAsia is known for its no-frills service and excellent safety record; the company has not had a fatal accident since it was founded in 1996. Its motto is: “Now everyone can fly.” By mid-afternoon, hope of a happy ending to the mystery had begun to fade – the plane would have run out of fuel hours earlier but no wreckage or flotsam had been sighted. Singapore’s civil aviation authority began contacting the passengers’ next of kin. Among the passengers on board were 138 adults, 16 children and one infant. Most were Indonesian; three were from South Korea, one from Malaysia, and one was a British man accompanying his two year-old Singaporean daughter. The co-pilot, Remi Emmanual Plesel, was French. Captain Iriyanto’s nephew Doni spoke to the local press. “[My uncle] is always helping people because he is a very caring person,” he told the Indonesian news portal Detik.com. “If there is a sick relative who needed help and even money, my uncle would be there.” At Singapore’s Changi airport, passengers went about their business – sipping coffee on layovers, scrambling to catch flights, meeting friends and relatives at arrival gates – as an electric sign ominously instructed family members of QZ8501 passengers to gather at a “relatives holding area” to wait for briefings. By late afternoon, 47 friends and relatives of 57 passengers were waiting in the holding area, which had been cordoned off by police. Louise Sidharta, 25, had been en route to the airport in Surabaya when she heard news of the missing jet on the radio. She suspected that her fiance, Alain Oktavianus Siaun, was on the plane with his parents and three brothers. The couple were to marry in May and had planned to meet on Sunday for a pre-wedding holiday in Singapore. Sidharta caught her 1.25pm flight, and by the time she emerged into the press scrum at Changi knew that Siaun and his family were among the missing. Sidharta maintained “a strong front”, the Malaysia Star reported, and “advised the family members of other passengers on the flight to stay strong and keep away from negative thoughts”. She told reporters: “We have to stay positive and hope that they could be found soon.” Facebook Twitter Pinterest Indonesia’s Air Transportation Department holds a news conference on Sunday. In Indonesia, family members gathered at Surabaya airport anxiously seeking updates on their phones. “I hope for a miracle and may God save them all,” a bespectacled young man told the Indonesian broadcaster tvOne. “I should have gone with them but I cancelled [my flight] two weeks ago. I have two friends and they went with five family members.” The man began to cry. “Yes, I planned to spend the new year of 2015 in Singapore,” he said, struggling to speak. “The morning before I went to pray and one of them called me and said: ‘See you in new year and see you forever.’” Indonesian authorities began to zero in on a possible crash zone near Belitung, a rugged island of white sand beaches and tin mines in the Java sea, off the coast of south Sumatra. The Indonesian air force dispatched two planes and a military helicopter; Malaysia and Singapore both lent C130 aircraft to the search. The four-engine turboprops are ideal for flying low over the water. The Indian navy put ships and aircraft on standby. “We are following the track of the plane so are flying north,” an Indonesian air force spokesman told AFP. “The weather is quite good. However we only have a few hours more to go as our fuel will run out after eight hours. By then it will also get dark.” Australia’s prime minister, Tony Abbott, called Indonesia’s president, Joko Widodo, to express condolences. He said Australia “would do whatever [it] humanly could” to help. At 5.30pm, as the sun set over Indonesia, authorities called off the search effort for the day. It would begin again at 7am on Monday, a transport ministry official told reporters – earlier if the weather remained good. After nightfall, AirAsia CEO Fernandes, apparently having arrived in Surabaya, began tweeting again.

Over 800 of the properties will be lost to coastal erosion within the next 20 years. The properties, worth well over £1bn, will be allowed to fall into the sea because the cost of protecting them would be far greater. But there is no compensation scheme for homeowners to enable them to move to a safer location. In December 2013, a huge tidal surge flooded 1,400 homes along the east coast and saw numerous homes tumble into the ocean. Earlier this month, the environment secretary, Liz Truss, visited Lowestoft on the anniversary of the surge, which flooded the town. Defra UK (@DefraGovUK) Environment Secretary Elizabeth Truss has been on the East Coast today to see recovery one year after the storm surge pic.twitter.com/u5Wkp6xRjL December 5, 2014 “Last winter’s storms saw the eastern seaboard overwhelmed,” said coastal community campaigner Chris Blunkell, who lives on the North Kent coast at Whitstable. “If government won’t defend all people living on the coast, then it must make sure that they can move elsewhere, and that means compensating them for their loss. It’s wrong that the costs of climate change should be borne by the most vulnerable.” Coastal erosion expert Professor Rob Duck, at Dundee University, said: “It is a very difficult issue, but we can’t defend everything at all costs. There are just not the resources to do it and keep on doing it. But it is not just about money, often people have lived in places for generations and there is a lot of history and memories.” The local authority in which most homes are expected to be lost in the next 20 years is Cornwall, with 76. Cornwall also tops the list for homes lost in 50 years, with 132. Looking 100 years ahead, six local authorities are expected to lose more than 200 homes each: Great Yarmouth (293), Southampton (280), Cornwall (273), North Norfolk (237), East Riding of Yorkshire (204) and Scarborough (203). Duck said the east coast from Yorkshire down to Essex is “soft and vulnerable” and that the stronger storms and rising sea level being driven by climate change will increase their vulnerability. A recent EA document stated: “It is widely accepted that [climate change] will lead to an acceleration of coastal erosion due to more aggressive marine conditions.” The EA analysis assumes that funding for shoreline management plans – a mix of holding the line and managed retreat – is maintained. Without this, the number of properties lost within 100 years would increase tenfold to over 74,000. The central estimate for properties lost even with continued coastal defence is 7,000, but the EA analysis found there is a 5% chance this could rise to almost 9,000 if the weather was particularly extreme. Currently, the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) states that “there are more than 200 homes at risk of complete loss to coastal erosion in the next 20 years”. But the newly revealed EA analysis puts the number at 295, and at 430 in the extreme case. “It is not feasible or affordable to protect every household now or in the long term, especially given the likely consequences of sea level rise,” said the EA and Defra, in a recent response to enquiries from Friends of the Earth. The EA and Defra added: “There is no statutory recourse to compensation for property lost or damaged due to coastal change.” “Compensating coastal communities affected by climate change is simply a matter of social justice,” said Friends of the Earth’s Guy Shrubsole. “At the moment, the government is dumping these costs on individual households and vulnerable communities.” “During last year’s tidal surge, the biggest since 1953, some people on the east coast were evacuated from their homes and given a biscuit in the church hall,” said Blunkell. “Yet Londoners could sleep easy protected by the Thames Barrier. A biscuit for some and a barrier for others is unjust, and such injustice will grow with rising sea levels.” A Defra spokeswoman said: “We are spending more than £3.2bn over the course of this parliament on flood management and protection from coastal erosion – half a billion more than in the previous parliament.” The first year of this parliament had a high flood defence budget set by the previous government, which was subsequently cut by about a quarter by the coalition. “Our first ever long-term investment strategy for flood defences will see a further 15,000 houses better protected from coastal erosion by the end of the decade,” the Defra spokeswoman added. She said grants were available to “assist local authorities with the immediate costs associated with the loss of a home to erosion”. The EA said these were up to £6,000 to cover demolition and removal costs. The EA implements flood and coastal defence plans under the budget given to it by Defra. An EA spokesman said: “We work with local authorities, which lead on shoreline management plans, to identify erosion risk management schemes, coastal erosion monitoring and further research on how we best adapt to these changes.”",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"French town tries to save first world war soldier’s room for posterity", "content": "Until this year, few would have known the name of dragoons officer Hubert Rochereau, or heard of the tiny village of Bélâbre in central France. But the revelation this autumn that the young soldier’s bedroom, complete with his feathered dress helmet and military jacket, had been preserved for almost 100 years after his death on a Belgian battlefield in the first world war brought unexpected recognition to both. Now Laurent Laroche, mayor of Bélâbre, is hoping his commune’s new-found fame will also bring a benefactor to save Rochereau’s room for posterity. “When you walk into it it’s as if time has stood still,” he told the Guardian. “On a much smaller scale, I imagine it’s how the explorers felt when they opened the first pyramid or ancient tomb. A portrait of French soldier Hubert Rochereau from the wall of his room in Belabre, France. Photograph: Free image “It would be a great shame for it to disappear. As someone who loves history, I feel it’s is also important not to forget the sacrifice made by men like Rochereau.” Second Lieutenant Hubert Guy Pierre Alphonse Rochereau, 21, a graduate of the elite French Saint-Cyr military school, died in an English field ambulance on 26 April 1918, a day after being wounded during fighting for the village of Loker in Flanders. His parents had no idea where he was buried until 1922 when his body was discovered in a British cemetery and repatriated to the graveyard at Bélâbre. They turned the room where their son had been born on 10 October 1896 into a permanent memorial, leaving it largely as it had been the day he went off to war. A detail of the uniform of French first world war second lieutenant Hubert Rochereau. Photograph: Guillaume Souvant/AFP/Getty Images On the shelves his school books and military manuals collect dust. On his desk lie a filled pipe, Gold Flake cigarettes, two pistols, a knife; keys and a notebook remain untouched alongside a small vial labelled as containing “the earth of Flanders in which our dear child fell and which kept his remains for four years”. On the lace counterpane that covers his iron bedstead are Rochereau’s medals – the Croix de Guerre and the Legion d’Honneur – and photographs of friends who also died in the war. The grief-stricken Rochereau, a distinguished military family whose forefathers were believed to go back to the French Revolution and Napoleon Bonaparte, then bricked up the entrance to the room. However, Laroche revealed that the sealing of the room was just the beginning of the property’s extraordinary and controversial history. In 1935, Hubert Rochereau’s parents bequeathed their substantial mansion house in Bélâbre to a military friend, General Eugène Bridoux, on the express condition that their late son’s room would remain untouched and unchanged for 500 years. The swords and other belongings of second lieutenant Hubert Rochereau in his bedroom left intact since his death in 1918. Photograph: Guillaume Souvant/AFP/Getty Images Seven years later, Bridoux became secretary of state in the Vichy regime and was responsible for organising the deportation of Jewish families to the Nazi concentration camps. During the Allied liberation of France, he escaped to Germany before being captured and returned to France where he again escaped and fled to Franco’s Spain where he remained until his death in 1955. Bridoux was condemned to death by the French authorities in absentia and his house in Bélâbre confiscated as the property of a collaborator. Laroche said it was rented to a family of solicitors until it was reclaimed in the 1950s by Bridoux’s granddaughter, whose husband, Daniel Fabre, still lives in the house. “They knew about the room at the end of the corridor but had never seen it because it was bricked up. So they broke down the wall and made this strange discovery,” Laroche said. “The family invited local officials to see it in the 1980s and said they intended to keep the promise made to keep the room untouched even though the clause in the sale document has no basis in French law. But we cannot forget that it is a private property. Mr Fabre has two daughters and we don’t know what they will do with it one day. Indeed, they are perfectly free to do whatever they want. “We are currently reflecting on what we can do to preserve the room, but to be honest we are a small local authority whose finances, like everyone’s, have been squeezed by the economic crisis. The fact is that while it would be nice to be able to one day buy the property and perhaps turn it into a museum, we simply don’t have the money.” Laroche added: “It is a magical place, which we believe was built using stone from the Middle Age ramparts of the village and has a superb little garden that is like something out of a fairytale. Perhaps one day a generous donor will come along and buy it.” Laroche said he was surprised at how the story of Rochereau’s room had captured headlines around the globe. “Someone even sent me a picture of someone in China reading the story in the Guardian,” he said. “Our little village is being spoken about the world over, which makes me proud to be mayor. And maybe it will help us find long-lost Rochereau relatives and save the room. It would be a great pity for it to be lost to future generations.”",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Rex Tillerson nominated as Donald Trump's secretary of state", "content": "Donald Trump’s decision to nominate the head of the biggest oil company in the world as America’s top diplomat on Tuesday triggered widespread alarm among environmentalists and critics of Russian influence. The president-elect named Rex Tillerson, the president and chief executive of ExxonMobil, as his nominee for secretary of state after an intensive and very public search. The pick appeared to divide Republicans and dismay Democrats, setting up an early battle of wills between Trump and Congress. Senators from both parties have raised concerns about Tillerson’s lack of government experience and close ties to the Russian president, Vladimir Putin. Russia and conflicts of interest: Rex Tillerson embodies quandaries for Trump Read more Trump hailed Tillerson as “among the most accomplished business leaders and international deal makers in the world” in a statement released on Tuesday by his transition team. “His tenacity, broad experience and deep understanding of geopolitics make him an excellent choice for secretary of state. He will promote regional stability and focus on the core national security interests of the United States.” The announcement of the oil executive for the role came after a selection process, played out in front of TV cameras, that considered figures including the former presidential candidate Mitt Romney and the former CIA director David Petraeus. But Tillerson’s confirmation hearings are likely to be a bitter and emotional struggle. He is a recipient of Moscow’s Order of Friendship, having grown close to Putin and his circle while working on oil exploration in Russia, which was frozen when the US imposed sanctions in 2014. He may also face questions over the potential benefits to ExxonMobil from US foreign policy if sanctions imposed on Russia after its annexation of Crimea were lifted. Republican hawks have made clear the ExxonMobil boss would have to convince them he would be tough on Russia and supportive of Nato to get through confirmation in the Senate, where the defection of only three Republicans would be sufficient to block the appointment and hand Trump an early setback. Already, three Republican senators have expressed misgivings: John McCain, Lindsey Graham and Marco Rubio. Rubio, a senator for Florida who ran against Trump in the presidential primaries, said: “While Rex Tillerson is a respected businessman, I have serious concerns about his nomination. The next secretary of state must be someone who views the world with moral clarity, is free of potential conflicts of interest, has a clear sense of America’s interests, and will be a forceful advocate for America’s foreign policy goals to the president, within the administration, and on the world stage.” Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina senator who also ran against Trump, added: “Based upon his extensive business dealings with the Putin government and his previous opposition of efforts to impose sanctions on the Russian government, there are many questions which must be answered. I expect the US-Russian relationship to be front and center in his confirmation process.” Facebook Twitter Pinterest Republican senators John McCain, left, and Marco Rubio. Both have expressed unease with the idea of Rex Tillerson serving as secretary of state. Photograph: Alex Brandon/AP But in an early sign of faultlines within the party, Trump loyalists rallied around the selection. Speaking at the conservative Heritage Foundation thinktank in Washington, Newt Gingrich, a former speaker of the House, goaded critics: “I’m going to confess up front here, Tillerson has a huge problem. He’s successful. Being successful in the largest corporation in the world, he’s actually been involved in making money.” As the audience burst into laughter, Gingrich continued: “Now, if you’re John Kerry or Hillary Clinton or the entire state department, and your entire career’s been one of going around the world unsuccessfully negotiating non-agreements, Tillerson is horrifying. I mean, what if he actually effectively represents America? What if we actually get good deals that make big jobs in America? What if he’s actually able to explain Trumpism to the world?” Gingrich, delivering an address entitled The Principles of Trumpism, added: “He’s going to be so well received around the planet that, combined with [defence secretary] Jim Mattis, he automatically changes who people think Trump is.” There was also support from Condoleezza Rice, a former secretary of state who refused to endorse Trump for president. She said: “I know Rex as a successful businessman and a patriot. He will represent the interests and the values of the United States with resolve and commitment. And he will lead the exceptional men and women of the state department with respect and dedication.” Senior Democrats, however, promised Tillerson a rough ride in the confirmation process. The party’s incoming Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, said the businessman would be “asked the most serious questions about his relationship with Russia, his disturbing opposition to sanctions on Russia, the Paris climate agreement, and how he views Putin”. The House minority leader, Nancy Pelosi, told MSNBC: “The coziness with Vladimir Putin is very alarming and should have eliminated him, frankly. Right now, his approach to the sanctions on Russia, because of their aggression in Europe, should be enough to say: perhaps another relationship with the administration, but not secretary of state.” Senator Chris Coons, a Democrat on the Senate foreign relations committee, said Tillerson would receive a “fair and open” hearing but he expected the businessman would face tough questions from senators of both parties about his priorities as the country’s top diplomat. “It troubles me greatly that Mr Tillerson would have reason to advocate for the rolling back of sanctions because that would in the best interest of his company,” the Democrat from Delaware told reporters on Tuesday. As an indication of where lawmakers on Capitol Hill stand on Russia, Coons noted that the Kentucky Republican Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, convened a breakfast las week with a dozen senators and the ambassadors and legislators from Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. Tillerson’s relationship with Putin would be less of a concern, Coons said, if the president-elect hadn’t exhibited a soft spot for the Russian leader throughout the campaign. “If we saw a national security team, a group of senior advisers, who were clear-eyed about Russia’s sustained efforts – overt and covert – to undermine Democracy across central and western Europe, I would be less concerned about this particular piece of Rex Tillerson’s business leadership,” said Coons. The nomination came shortly after a CIA assessment that Russia sought to meddle in the election on Trump’s behalf. Adam Schiff, the ranking member of the House permanent select committee on intelligence, said: “There was celebrating in the Duma on the night Donald Trump was elected president; with this choice, the celebration in Moscow goes on.” The White House noted that Tillerson’s Order of Friendship award chimed with Trump’s repeated calls for warmer relations with Russia. Press secretary Josh Earnest said he expected lawmakers from both sides would ask probing questions. “Mr Tillerson is a seasoned business executive and he’s got some skills in answering tough questions in public, and I suspect he’ll have to put them to use in the spring.” Tillerson, who has spent the past 41 years at Exxon, was due to retire next year. According to regulatory filings, he retains a huge financial interest in the oil company, owning $151m in company stock. In 2015, Tillerson’s total compensation, including salary, bonus and new share awards, was worth $27.3m. ExxonMobil has operations in more than 50 countries and has partnered with Qatar’s state oil company, Qatar Petroleum, on a project to build a natural gas terminal on the Gulf of Mexico. The company is also under investigation for misleading investors about what it knew about climate change. Greenpeace UK’s executive director, John Sauven, said: “So a real-life JR Ewing becomes America’s chief diplomat as Donald Trump does away with the usual intermediaries and directly outsources foreign policy to the fossil fuel industry. We spent years warning that Exxon was too close to the US government. Now they are the government.” It was also reported on Tuesday that Trump would pick former Texas governor Rick Perry as his energy secretary. The irony was not lost on political observers who recalled a 2011 Republican primary debate in which Perry said: “It’s three agencies of government, when I get there, that are gone – commerce, education and the, um, what’s the third one there? Let’s see.” He later clarified that he meant to say energy. Additional reporting by Dominic Rushe and Alan Yuhas",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Othello review – Daniel Craig and David Oyelowo dazzle in modern retelling", "content": "Sam Gold sets his dynamic and ultimately devastating Othello, which stars David Oyelowo as the Moor and Daniel Craig as the meanie, amid a contemporary barracks. The soiled mattresses and clumsy field telephones suggest a war that won’t be won. There are plenty of muscles and knives and guns at hand, but the enemy never arrives and the violence turns inwards. What goes on in the wings: actors' backstage secrets Read more At first, this conceit, with bicep-flexing soldiers playing Guitar Hero and reading comic books, seems mere pose. And sometimes it is. But as the play pushes past the introductory scenes, Andrew Lieberman’s design, which camouflages the theater in plywood and packs in the audience on three sides of the playing space, becomes a fine place to explore the toxic masculinity that sets the tragedy in motion and enables its consummation. Interestingly, this production minimizes questions of race and racism. There are several actors of color playing soldiers. It focuses instead on Othello’s foreignness and how his status as an outsider makes him doubt his position in the community. Maybe it’s the political climate, but Iago’s malignity seems less motiveless than usual. He’s a straight white man who overestimates his own value. As he did in the Broadway revival of Harold Pinter’s Betrayal, Craig manages to diminish his natural Bond-ian glamour. His Iago is sly and confiding, small in everything except his spite, a stance that allows him to work his villainy. Oyelowo’s soft, rounder face opposes Craig’s sharp, square one. His rich tones and full-bore passion contrast with Craig’s quieter, narrower style. If Craig’s Iago believes that the world owes him a debt, then Oyelowo’s Othello worries that he has been given more than he deserves. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Daniel Craig, David Oyelowo, Finn Wittrock, and Glenn Fitzgerald. Photograph: New York Theatre Workshop In Oyelowo’s emotive performance, which suggests Othello’s otherness with a slight African accent, there’s a vein of self-loathing that runs fast and wide within him. He’s confident in his military prowess, though the abrupt conclusion of the war in Cyprus wrong-foots him, but less confident in the love that Desdemona has for him. When Iago begins to pour poison in his ear, Othello credits what he hears, because he’s internalized the animus and suspicion with which most people approach him. He’s a man who has the courage of his convictions – his faith, his command. Yet self-doubt robs him of the convictions of his courage, so he cravenly kills his wife. Rachel Brosnahan’s Desdemona is the character least served by Gold’s setting. The character’s passivity threatens to make her bland and the military milieu makes her seem unusually ineffectual, though her death, which Gold stages with unusual intimacy, carries its full heft of horror. Oyelowo finds the most to do with the verse, rendering it clearly and lyrically. Most of the rest of the actors convey the sense of the language rather than enjoying it, but perhaps that’s what Gold wants. Poetry might come across as too feminine. Still, he and his dramaturg, Michael Sexton, find accessibility and humor in the text and there are finely varied performances from Matthew Maher’s hapless Roderigo, Finn Wittrock’s pretty boy Cassio, David Wilson Barnes’s pensive Duke and Marsha Stephanie Blake’s waspish Emilia. Gold’s version, which begins in darkness, emphasizes the occluded vision of the characters, who mistrust and misperceive their friend, their enemies, themselves. Still, the audience seemed to have the measure of it. After more than three hours crammed on to uncomfortable wooden benches, they leapt up to applaud it, loving it wisely and well.

{ "title":"Michael Gove says sorry for MoJ divorce settlement software error", "content": "It is “deeply regrettable” that thousands of couples who settled their divorces in the past 20 months might have to reopen negotiations due to a software error revealed by the Guardian, Michael Gove has said. The justice secretary apologised to all those hit by faults with “Form E” on his ministry’s website, which has been miscalculating assets since April 2014, potentially inflating the financial worth of a spouse. Revealed: divorce software error hits thousands of settlements Read more The error was spotted earlier this month by a family law specialist, Nicola Matheson-Durrant of the Family Law Clinic in Ascot, Berkshire. The Ministry of Justice only publicly admitted to the problem on Thursday and has published an email address – formE@hmcts.gsi.gov.uk – asking anyone who believes they have been affected to contact the department. Speaking on the World at One on BBC Radio 4 on Friday, Gove said: “It is deeply regrettable that a form was online since April 2014, which has meant … up to 17,000 people may have had the allocation of resources, at what is an inevitably stressful time in their life, miscalculated.” Gove offered his apologies to all those affected. One particular paragraph, numbered 2.20, which is supposed to produce totals, fails to reflect the minus figure of final liabilities entered earlier on, producing a simple mathematical error. If a party had significant debts or liabilities, they were not recognised or recorded on the electronic form, potentially inflating their true worth. Distorted net figures of applicants’ assets were therefore being produced. Not all divorcing or separating couples use the online form – some prefer pen and paper calculations – but the impact of the errors could be widespread. The discovery comes at a time when the senior judiciary and the justice secretary are encouraging the development of online justice as a means of improving courtroom efficiency and making further economies. Earlier this year an official report backed by the master of the rolls, Lord Dyson, recommended that the UK civil justice system undergo a radical overhaul for the digital age, with the creation of an online court to expand access to justice and resolve claims of up to £25,000. Those most likely to have been affected by the divorce form’s miscalculations are litigants who could not afford to employ a lawyer and who had more modest assets, where the disparity may have been less immediately noticeable. A number of recent divorcees who experienced difficulties with the form contacted the Guardian. One man said he had emailed family justice officials in August 2014 to point out the error but the MoJ response had not acknowledged that there was a fault. He eventually printed out the form and entered correct figures by hand. Another man, who wished to remain anonymous, said he noticed the calculations left out debts or liabilities. He did not dispute it because, although a “significant sum”, it was relatively small compared to other disputed assets. He did not see the “workings” so assumed the solicitor had made a mistake in a manual calculation. A third man, experienced in using spreadsheets, said he managed to overwrite the electronic website, adding a note in red letters pointing out the error and inserting corrected figures. “I realised it was throwing up false figures,” he said. Jo Edwards, a solicitor who is chair of the family law organisation Resolution, called for additional court costs incurred by divorced couples to be paid by the government. “Some of the thousands of people potentially affected by the unfortunate Form E error, many of them self-represented litigants, may need to return to the courtroom to have their financial settlements renegotiated,” she said. “In these cases, I would expect any further court fees – £50 if agreement is reached and a consent order lodged with the court, £255 if there is no agreement and court proceedings need to be issued – to be waived, as the additional court costs will be incurred through no fault of the applicant’s own. “However, it seems highly unlikely that the government will find itself liable for lawyer’s fees in these reopened cases – such a sum would be unquantifiable and place a huge strain on the public purse.” Another family law expert, Carmel Brown, from the firm Thomas Eggar, said: “This error of the MoJ’s software is very basic but potentially catastrophic. In particular, it could seriously affect those people with large liabilities, including credit card debts, bank loans and tax liabilities, as the miscalculation would produce a wrong and misleading picture of their wealth.”",diasaster:0},

{ "title":"Sanders: Clinton's pursuit of 'regime change' in Libya helped rise of Isis", "content": "Bernie Sanders has accused Hillary Clinton of encouraging Islamic extremism in Libya, in a prelude to a Democratic debate on Saturday during which he is expected to go on the attack for the first time over the unintended consequences of the former secretary of state’s more interventionist foreign policy. Speaking to the Guardian in an extensive pre-debate interview, the senator from Vermont criticised Clinton for carelessly fomenting regime change in Libya “without worrying” about the ensuing instability that has helped Islamic State forces take hold in the country. “Regime change without worrying about what happens the day after you get rid of the dictator does not make a lot of sense,” Sanders said. “I voted against the war in Iraq ... Secretary Clinton voted for that war. She was proud to have been involved in regime change in Libya, with [Muammar] Gaddafi, without worrying, I think, about what happened the day after and the kind of instability and the rise of Isis that we have seen in Libya.” Clinton has previously defended her role in airstrikes against Gaddafi in 2011, arguing he was a “murderous dictator ... who had American blood on his hands” and there was pressure for US action from European and Arab allies. But the latest Sanders comments are in stark contrast to the first debate of the Democratic presidential nomination process, where Sanders came to Clinton’s rescue during the height of the Benghazi committee’s investigation into her communications over Libya, saying: “The American people are sick and tired of hearing about your damn emails.” Many of his supporters have become frustrated at what they see as a reticence by Sanders to attack Clinton’s record directly, particularly after he appeared to be a reluctant participant in foreign policy discussions that dominated the second debate, held in the wake of the Paris terrorist attacks. Since then, the 2016 presidential campaign has become overwhelmed with national security questions. Republicans have competed to sound toughest, Ted Cruz vowing that he would “carpet bomb” Isis jihadis. Clinton has delivered three hawkish speeches in a month on the need for more intervention in Iraq and Syria, the need to stand “taller and stronger” against terrorism and the need for Silicon Valley companies to police internet access to thwart jihadi recruiters. Though initially reluctant to let foreign policy distract from what he considers a more important domestic agenda, the Sanders campaign increasingly sees his opponent’s hawkishness as an opportunity for him to turn Saturday’s debate in New Hampshire into a clash on the best way of achieving lasting national security. “We have to be smart and not just tough,” he said. “And that means it’s not just destroying Isis, it’s making sure we do it in a way that leads to a better future and more stability in that region. And that means, absolutely in my view, that it cannot simply be as we did in Iraq ... It cannot simply be unilateral American action. What it means is a broad coalition, in which the troops on the ground are Muslim troops.” He also turned on Republicans and hawks in the Democratic party for not heeding the lessons of recent US intervention in the Middle East. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Hawks and doves: an animated guide to 2016 candidates’ foreign policy views “Sometimes in our country, especially among our Republican friends who suffer from amnesia, we forget what happened yesterday,” added Sanders. “I can remember like it was yesterday, when we had a ‘tough’ president. George W Bush, and his vice-president was even tougher. So tough! And they went into Iraq, man, and they got rid of Saddam Hussein, terrible guy. But they forgot to be thinking about what happens the day after you get rid of Saddam Hussein. What has happened in that region, as everybody knows, is there is massive instability, human tragedies beyond belief. In terms of people in that region, in terms of American soldiers, there is PTSD, traumatic brain injury, 6,700 dying.” Sanders concedes that his vision of the US playing a supporting role in the fight agaisnt Isis rather than leading intervention is close to that of Barack Obama, but argues a tougher approach with Arab allies in the region is needed. “The area that I would be a little bit different from Obama is I would put more pressure on Saudi Arabia, on Qatar, which happens to be per capita the wealthiest country on earth,” he said during Tuesday’s interview in Portsmouth, New Hampshire. 'No BS in Bernie Sanders': unwavering fight against the mega-rich still resonates Read more “I think the United States, UK, France, Germany, Russia, have the power to make sure that there are Muslim boots on the ground,” added Sanders. He also blasted the impatience among many to provide glib reassurance to Americans in the face of complex and unpredictable domestic terror threats. “Any idiot, especially one who is prepared to die, who has a gun, can start shooting up people,” added the Vermont senator. “Can I guarantee you, can you guarantee me that this will not happen? Nobody can.” Certain gun control has ‘broad consensus’ Though foreign policy has become a growing part of the senator’s campaign stump speech in recent days, he has largely avoided talking about gun control – an area where Clinton argues his record as a rural state senator is weak. Sanders acknowledged this was an area of vulnerability but insisted his proposals for banning assault weapons and closing background check loopholes placed him the Democratic mainstream over the issue. “I happen to believe that certain types of assault weapons, which are manufactured and designed for military purposes to kill people very quickly, should not be used in civilian society,” he said. “There is a gun show loophole, which says you can circumvent the background check by going to a gun show and getting guns. We have to deal with that ... I believe we have to deal with what is called the strawman provision, which means that you can walk in and legally buy a gun and then sell it to him who is a criminal.” Though less sweeping than many in the party would like, Sanders argues there is more practical chance of achieving political support for such measures. “That is a broad consensus,” added Sanders. “That is what I believe, what I have voted for. It is not very different from what Hillary Clinton or anybody else believes. But politics being what it is, they saw that as a vulnerability of mine because I come from a state that doesn’t have any gun control but I think we’re handling it fine now.” On other issues, Sanders said that Clinton has reluctantly moved closer to his position – arguing his campaign has achieved significant progress regardless of how it now fares in the party primary. Can you receive huge amounts from the wealthiest people in this country and say ‘I’m going to really take them on’? Bernie Sanders “I think we have shifted the debate ... You are seeing Hillary Clinton and others beginning to move in our direction,” he said. Sanders insists the differences between them remain “very significant”: “I was from day one in opposition to the Keystone pipeline. It took her a long time to come about. Trade policy is the same thing. So I think the differences between Secretary Clinton and myself are pretty profound. She has a Super Pac. I don’t have a Super Pac.” He also draws new parallels with her husband’s record on Wall Street, where he wants to break up big banks and Clinton does not. “I believe, during the 1990s, President Bill Clinton and the Republicans fought very hard to deregulate Wall Street, I led the opposition to that,” he said. “I did not think it was a good idea to allow investment banks, commercial banks and insurance companies to merge. My view today is that we have got to break up these huge institutions that have so much political and economic power.” And the Vermont senator now seems increasingly willing to draw a public line between Clinton’s fundraising on Wall Street and her policies toward the economy as a whole. “Ultimately the real issue is which candidate is prepared, frontally, to take on the billionaire class,” he said. “Can you receive huge amounts of campaign contributions from Wall Street and the wealthiest people in this country and say ‘Well, I’m going to really take them on’? The answer is no, you are not going to do that.” Read the full Bernie Sanders interview transcript",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"The essence of British democracy is under threat ", "content": "Andy Beckett’s list of the wrongdoings of George Osborne is incomplete (The great Tory power grab, G2, 15 December). He misses out the way Osborne has divided and ruled. Surely with David Cameron’s approval, Osborne set up “the northern powerhouse”, a very motley group of Liverpool, Manchester, Leeds, Sheffield, Middlesbrough and Newcastle. I don’t think this is a natural group. I write as a Tynesider. No doubt some in the area are flattered, and many will want to grab the opportunities, but I think it is a divide-and-rule trap. And the different local authorities within it are being set up with powers that don’t match. The ring of towns around the southern Pennines are a much more natural unit: Liverpool, Manchester, Leeds, Sheffield, Nottingham, Leicester, Coventry, Birmingham and Stoke. At the speeds of HS2 and HS3, all the towns of this ring will be within 20-40 minutes’ travel time of each other, about the time that the various units of central London are of each other and together their population well exceeds that of London. “Ringby” as I would call it, is the natural centre of Britain, and Osborne has set up regional rivalries to stop it coming into being. Michael Bell Newcastle upon Tyne • There are some points in the article about the Tories rigging the electoral system that are open to question. Why is it wrong to “even out constituency size”? If pruning and evening out the constituencies leads to more Tories, then it is clear they were disadvantaged to start with. Why should we try to stop the boundary review? Liverpool has no Tory MPs – are there no Tory voters in Liverpool? True, as Tim Bale says, “no one is going to get excited about this stuff”. He says it is a “chattering-class issue”. But the key issue, unexplored, is why the Tory government is involved in the issue in the first place. If the Labour government (guilty as member) had done what the Plant commission from the early 1990s had suggested and handed it all to an independent electoral commission, we would not have the allegation in the first place. Government, opposition or parliament should not have any role in date, process, or inner working of the electoral system. If they do then it will always be open to question with the electorate – “they are in it for themselves”. The second chamber is there to stop a parliament or electoral commission extending a parliament – that should be the extent of Westminster involvement. And I am as uneasy about Osborne as he clearly is with people. But he is a distraction to the main issues. Jeff Rooker Labour, House of Lords • To Andy Beckett’s useful checklist could be added a couple of other changes, both of which will have the effect of cementing Tory hegemony – namely the constant attacks on professionals as alternative loci of power; and the increasing contracting out of state services now that there is little left to privatise. Roy Boffy Walsall • The Guardian is to be congratulated for exposing the disturbing attack on our democracy currently being perpetrated by the Conservative government. Even more disturbing, perhaps, is the dismantling of local government decision-making through the privatisation agenda. An example of this is the academy programme, whereby schools become answerable only to central government and not to locally elected representatives. The deafening silence from the Labour party is most worrying. The self-indulgent infighting among Labour MPs means that they are failing to represent those of us who are not in a position to oppose these sly, underhand, Tory anti-democratic policies. Robin Taverner Colchester, Essex • I hope Jeremy Corbyn has noted the points made by Andy Beckett in the Tory quest to game the system by undermining the funding and electoral chances of opposition parties. The system that delivered the Tory majority out of an electoral minority (36.9% of the vote) is deeply flawed anyhow and a “new politics” worthy of the name must address those flaws. If Jeremy Corbyn really wants a kinder and decent form of politics, he can only do so in concert with other opposition parties. To break the Conservative hold on power requires Labour, Lib Dems, Greens and nationalists to speak to each other and form an electoral pact at the next election, where an agreement is reached to run only one “pact” candidate in every constituency. This election must be a special election on a simple manifesto commitment to change our electoral rules. First, an end to the five-year parliament rule. Second, the introduction of PR for Westminster elections. Once these changes have been enacted a second election could be called where the parties fight under their own colours. This change would reinvigorate politics by making it meaningful for all citizens to participate rather than wait for those few in marginal constituencies to make the difference. It will also stop the Tory minority being able to change society in the interests of the few rather than the many. Peter Cushion Helston, Cornwall • Is there a clearer illustration of the privatisation of the education system than the 48% increase in salary to £221,600 of the executive head of the Gorse academies trust (Report, 15 December), or a better way of supporting for the long term the great Tory power grab Andy Beckett foresees? Does your blood boil at the former or freeze at the latter? John Bailey St Albans, Hertfordshire • Andy Beckett’s exposure of George Osborne’s project to turn Britain into a single-party state is more than overdue. A mere 25% of the enfranchised voted Conservative. Osborne’s is an extreme minority government. If we actually believe that a democracy is something worth having, this abominable attempt to subvert it has to be opposed vociferously and effectively. That small part of the media which is not part of the Tory propaganda machine should be doing the former. Is it too much to hope that the Labour party might think about setting its shoulder to the latter? Michael Rosenthal Banbury, Oxfordshire • Is it just me? Have messrs Cameron and Osborne lost their irony satnav? Firstly, the Lords kicked back their tax credits proposals (rightly so) and there was righteous indignation and threats from both against the Lords. In the aftermath, it seems that most Conservative MPs agreed with the Lords and unbelievably, in the following budget review, Osborne ditched the very proposal which he seemed to be prepared to fight for to the last trench. To my mind, the Lords did their proper job of reviewing legislation coming from the Commons, confirmed both by Conservative MPs and Osborne himself. Secondly, the job of reviewing the role of the Lords was given to the hereditary, and thus non-elected, Lord Strathclyde. No surprise then that he proposes to take away this reviewing role of the Lords. Democracy is in danger in the UK at the moment, as the Guardian has flagged up. The above proposals are another step on this dangerous road. They need to be resisted with all energy and persistence.

{ "title":"The Guardian view on drinking culture: statistics, myths and alcohol abuse", "content": "The last Friday before Christmas is, wait for it, Booze Black Friday. Not, for once, a new marketing tool, but the gloomy prognosis of the country’s ambulance services as they await the predictable consequences of the day when it’s estimated that alcohol sales peak and Britons double their normal alcohol consumption. All over the Christmas-celebrating world, but particularly in the countries of northern Europe and in Australia, there will be unhappy people waking up tomorrow feeling, as Kingsley Amis’s Lucky Jim felt, as if “his mouth had been used as a latrine by some small creature of the night, and then as its mausoleum”. Drinking so much alcohol that it becomes a health concern is largely restricted to the parts of the globe where alcohol is available, acceptable and affordable and good health the norm. In these countries, regular harmful drinking (anything above the recommended daily units of alcohol – three for women and four for men) is most common among middle-class, middle-aged people, particularly men but increasingly women, and among unemployed men. Binge drinkers tend to be young. The growth in excessive drinking that has been evident for a generation may have peaked; all the same, according to government figures drinking too much costs the NHS £3.5bn, productivity falls by £7.5bn and drink-associated crime costs a further £11bn. However bad the hangover (“even my hair hurts”: Rock Hudson, Pillow Talk), drinking is still often seen as glamorous, and it still predisposes drinkers to very unglamorous diseases such as cirrhosis of the liver, various cancers and a tendency to pick fights. Efforts are struggling to persuade tipplers that they are not, as Samuel Johnson said, improved, merely unaware of their defects. No wonder campaigners want minimum pricing of alcohol, something the government rejects despite its own research showing a link between higher prices and less harmful drinking. Just this week, the BMJ reported that the advisory body Nice had been warned by official sources not to discuss alcohol pricing. The evidence linking consumption and harm is unquestionable. All the same, in the UK, there is a whiff of moral panic about the reporting of the way people drink. Take the claim that Britons who drink, drink more than in the rest of the drinking world. Not so. Germany and France, as well as most of eastern Europe (and don’t even mention Russia) all have higher average consumption. The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development average is 10.1 litres of alcohol per capita. While in the US, most people drink much less (and many people don’t drink at all), in the UK, the average is 10.6 litres, but in France it is a whole litre more. In all countries, the tendency is for the top one-fifth of drinkers to consume more than half of all the alcohol that’s drunk. So while it’s unquestionably the case that some people drink far too much for their own or society’s good and ought to rein in or stop, most people don’t overdo it. For every problem drinker, four people take only a glass or two from time to time. What marks Britons out is the widespread determination to go out and get smashed. It should not be a badge of honour to end a night out in the booze tent put up at the station by a desperate NHS ambulance trust. Remember Samuel Butler’s observation: “If the headache would only precede the intoxication, alcoholism would be a virtue.” It doesn’t, and it isn’t.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Rescuers battle through night to save passengers on burning Italian ferry", "content": "More than 200 people were still trapped on a burning ferry between Italy and Albania on Monday morning, despite Italian, Greek and Albanian crews working in rough, freezing conditions through the night to rescue them. Ships and helicopters fought choppy seas and strong winds in the dark in a race against time to rescue passengers still left aboard the Italian-flagged Norman Atlantic. The Italian coastguard said 251 of the 478 people on the ferry had been evacuated by early Monday. Most were airlifted by helicopter to other merchant vessels sailing nearby, though a few were flown to southern Italy to be treated for hypothermia. Officials in the Adriatic port of Bari were preparing for the first large group – around 49 people – to arrive early on Monday. They were initially expected in Brindisi down the coast, but rough seas forced a change of plans, officials said. At least one person died and two were injured in the incident. The fire broke out before dawn on Sunday on a car deck of the ferry, which was travelling from the western Greek port of Patras to the Italian port of Ancona on the Adriatic Sea, with 422 passengers and 56 crew members on board. Passenger Giorgos Stiliaras told Greek Mega TV that people were awakened by “the smell of burning plastic” and that the heat from the fire felt like the floors were “boiling.” Italy and Greece sent navy and coastguard vessels and helicopters, while nearby merchant ships lined up to form a barrier to protect the ferry from towering waves and to help the rescue. Italian navy spokesman Riccardo Rizzotto said the weather was “so bad we need an extraordinary level of support” in the rescue operation. As darkness fell, the Italian defence minister, Roberta Pinotti, said rescue operations would continue throughout the night. “It’s going to be a long night,” Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi said on Twitter. Nine of the rescued people were taken to the Italian town of Lecce. Of those, three children and a pregnant woman were being treated for hypothermia in Lecce hospital. Dr Raffaele Montinaro said the children were in excellent condition and emergency room doctor Antonio Palumbo said the mother’s condition was also good. A Greek passenger who had fallen from an escape chute into the Adriatic Sea with his wife was found dead by Italian coastguards, despite repeated attempts at an air rescue amid six-metre (19.6-ft) waves. His injured wife was safely plucked from the water and transferred to the Italian port of Brindisi. The second injury was to a member of the Italian military involved in the rescue operation, coastguard admiral Giovanni Pettorino said. The Greek shipping minister, Miltiadis Varvitsiotis, said bad weather, with winds that at one point had reached 55mph (88km/h) earlier, had hampered attempts to reach the Norman Atlantic. He told reporters that the Italian-led operation was “ one of the most complicated rescue operations that we have ever done”. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Greek authorities making ‘superhuman effort’ to rescue passengers on burning ferry. An Italian air force helicopter pilot said smoke was invading the helicopter cabin, making rescue even more challenging. “With the wind, smoke entered into the helicopter cabin, acrid smoke,” Major Antonio Laneve told Italian state TV. Some of those they were trying to rescue were very frightened of being hoisted up by helicopter given the adverse weather, he said. Pettorino told Italy’s Sky TG24 TV that two Italian tugs tried to attach themselves to the ferry in the evening, but were frustrated by the thick smoke. The shipping ministry identified the Greek casualty as Giorgos Doulis, who had been on the ferry with his wife, Theodora. The Greek maritime ministry said 268 of the passengers were Greek, with the crew made up of 22 Italians and 34 Greeks. The rest of the passengers included 54 Turks, 44 Italians, 22 Albanians, 18 Germans as well as Swiss, French, Russian, Austrian, British and Dutch nationals. It was reported that two people on board were Australian dual nationals. On Sunday night a spokeswoman for the UK Foreign Office said: “A number of British nationals were on board. We believe some have now been rescued, but the rescue operation is ongoing.” Among those waiting to be rescued was British showjumper Nick Channing Williams, who is based in Greece. It was earlier reported that he had been airlifted to safety along with his fiancee, Regina Theoffili, but his family said Italian officials had informed them otherwise. Channing Williams’s mother, Dotty, from Berkshire, said it had been a frustrating wait for news. She said: “We are of course pleased that Regina is off [the boat], but we can’t get any information. We have been up the whole night trying to phone people and trying to find out exactly what is happening. “I had told people they had both been airflifted and were fine and now that’s not the case. A lot of what we’re hearing is hearsay, we don’t really know.” Susan Daltas said her daughter Mia, a British national, and two granddaughters had been rescued. “I’ve heard recently from Marcus, our son-in-law, who kept the phone, that they’ve been airlifted to safety – the two little girls and Mia. But he’s still on the ferry, as far as we understand,” Daltas told the BBC on Sunday night. She said her youngest granddaughter had been taken to a mainland hospital. “She was suffering from hypothermia because they didn’t even manage to get a coat out of the cabin before they had to go on deck. But apparently she’s now sleeping,” she said. Of her son-in-law, Mrs Daltas said: “He was shaken, obviously, but I think he’d been staying strong for the family, and the minute they were safe he went a bit wobbly. It’s just cold, and he said his mobile was soaking wet because they had to keep moving around the boat to get away from the fire. So it’s obviously not pleasant.” A passenger interviewed by Greek Skai TV after she was rescued from the ferry said that at 6.30am she had noticed a “strange smell in the cabin”, but heard no alarm until much later. Carlo Visentini, the chief executive of the Visenti Group which owns the boat, said the vessel underwent checks on 19 December in Patras and the minor flaws revealed had been addressed, including a problem with a fire door. “This was immediately repaired to the satisfaction of the inspectors,” he said.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"NYPD chief defends mayor de Blasio and criticises police funeral protest", "content": "The commissioner of the New York Police Department, Bill Bratton, has given strong backing to Bill de Blasio, denouncing the protest of rank-and-file officers who turned their back on the mayor at a weekend funeral as politicised and inappropriate. Speaking on CBS on Sunday, the leader of the largest police force in the US came out fighting on behalf of the beleaguered politician who appointed him. “This is a mayor who cares very deeply about New York police officers, cares very deeply about the divide in the city and is working hard to heal that divide,” Bratton said. De Blasio has faced expressions of open hostility from New York’s police unions since two officers were killed last weekend. On Saturday, a cordon of officers turned their backs on the mayor’s image as it was being screened outside Christ Tabernacle church in Queens, where de Blasio was speaking at the funeral of one of the murdered officers, Rafael Ramos. Bratton condemned the silent protest of the police officers. “I certainly don’t support that action”, he said. “That funeral was held to honor officer Ramos, and to bring politics into that event was very inappropriate.” In the most incendiary comments made since the deaths of Ramos and his partner, officer Wenjian Liu, the president of the NYC Patrolmen’s Benevolent Association, Pat Lynch, effectively blamed protesters against perceived police brutality and the mayor’s office for the shooting. “That blood on the hands starts on the steps of City Hall, in the office of the mayor,” Lynch said, just hours after the officers were killed by Ismaaiyl Brinsley, a 28-year-old man with a history of mental health problems and a criminal record who cited on social media the desire to kill police in revenge for recent police shootings of black men. With so much tension in the air between police, politicians and public following a spate of high-profile deaths – including Michael Brown in Ferguson; Eric Garner in New York Tamir Rice in Cleveland and Ramos and Liu – Bratton has become something of a national figurehead in the search for solutions. His appearances on Sunday on CBS and NBC put him at the centre of the debate on policing that has erupted since Brown’s death at the hands of a white police officer in Ferguson in August. Bratton’s visibility was in contrast to de Blasio, who was pointedly absent from the airwaves. Officers turn their backs as de Blasio speaks during the funeral of Rafael Ramos. Photograph: Shannon Stapleton/Reuters On NBC, Bratton repeated the core theme that he struck in his remarks at the Ramos funeral – that mutual understanding must be found between police and protesters. “We must find the common ground so that all parties understand the concerns of others,” he said. “Seeing each other, to understand – that means not look past each other, but to really see what is motivating the other.” Bratton, who is no stranger to controversy having held senior police positions at similar times of strife in Boston and Los Angeles, as well as in New York between 1994 and 1996, sought to dilute the concentrated feelings around the policing issue by casting it as a problem with wide causes. “This isn’t just about policing”. he said. “It’s about continuing poverty rates, disparity between wealthy and poor, unemployment – there are so many national issues that have to be addressed.” The commissioner made particular mention of the contract negotiations that are ongoing between New York city hall and the police unions – hinting, though not saying overtly, that there might be a political motivation behind the aggressively hostile stance of the police unions toward the mayor. While the de Blasio administration has reached an agreement with several key unions, including teachers, it is still locked in an impasse with the police unions. Bratton positioned himself bang in the middle of the raging dispute as someone who empathised with the parents of black teenagers worried about their children’s interactions with police and with police officers in equal measure. He tried to defuse the NYPD anger around de Blasio’s comment that he had “trained” his own biracial son, Dante, to take extra care in encounters with police officers by saying that attitude was prevalent. “I interact quite frequently with African Americans from all classes and there’s not a single one that hasn’t expressed this concern,” Bratton said.

Photograph: Andy Katz/Demotix/Corbis On the other side, he also praised the professionalism of the NYPD, which he said had shown “great restraint in the face of incredible provocation”. Police morale, he admitted, was low, and he said he expected the rift with the mayor to carry on “for some time”. A former mayor of New York, Rudy Giuliani, who appointed Bratton to his first stint as the city’s police commissioner in 1994, also appeared on CBS. He called on de Blasio to apologise to the NYPD. Giuliani, who was mayor between 1994 and 2001, said the current mayor, perhaps unwittingly, had “created an impression with the police that he was on the side of the protesters”. “He should have apologised for the remarks he made that gave the police the impression he was on the other side,” Giuliani said. Giuliani, a one-time candidate for the Republican presidential nomination, insisted that he was giving such advice in “good faith” and not as an act of political interference toward the Democratic mayor. Once an apology was issued, Giuliani predicted, the stand off with the NYPD would be over.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Asthma rife among elite athletes, finds study", "content": "It’s not unknown for elite sports people to have asthma – Paula Radcliffe and Paul Scholes are among well-known British examples – but the good news for wheezy children wistfully dreaming of a sporting career is that research is increasingly uncovering just how many asthmatics there are in top-level sport. In fact, tThe figures can seem astonishing. John Dickinson from Kent university, a world expert on asthma in sport, who has tested all 33 UK-based swimmers from the British Swimming squad found 70% have some form of asthma. A similar test on the cyclists from Team Sky revealed about a third are prone to a wheeze, against a national asthma rate of about 8% to 10%. The picture is, inevitably, a bit more complicated. While a few have so-called classic asthma, the largely allergy-triggered constriction of the bronchial tubes that usually begins in childhood, Dickinson tests for what is known as exercise-induced asthma, or EIA. The symptoms are similar – a contraction of the airways brings the feeling of a tight chest – but instead it is caused by rapid and heavy breathing during exertion. Atmospheric factors can exacerbate this. The chlorine environment in pools is believed to be part of the reason for the very high EIA levels for high-level swimmers, while cold air can also be a trigger, boosting numbers for road cyclists and the likes of cross-country skiers, with about half of the latter group having the condition. Dickinson, head of the respiratory clinic at Kent’s School of Sport and Exercise Science, says he nonetheless views it as asthma: “It depends which respiratory consultant you talk to on whether you put these athletes on a spectrum of asthma, or whether you think that’s purely down to them exercising really hard in a certain environment, and if you take them out of that environment they’re fine. It’s a grey zone. But my argument is it’s a form of asthma.” The test he uses involves athletes being asked to breathe a very dry air mixture for six minutes at high ventilation, with their lung function tested before and after. The asthma-induced fall can be dramatic, as high as 40%, Dickinson says: “Athletes with asthma can feel bad if perceiving their lung function has dropped. They get used to pushing themselves, get used to feeling out of breath and being able to control that.” The phenomenon of EIA is not new, with some mass screening programmes beginning before the 2008 Beijing Olympics due to concerns about pollution. But tests like Dickinson’s are helping to uncover the scale of it, while revised anti-doping regulations are helping to treat the symptoms. In the past, asthma medications had to be cleared with doping authorities, via medical certificates. Now, any athlete can use common bronchio-dilating inhalers like salbuthamol so long as they do not exceed a certain dose.From his work with cyclists, Dickinson says, surprising numbers carry inhalers in the back pockets of their jerseys: “Cognitively, the inhaler can give you the confidence to push yourself that little bit more. Sometimes a rider will know a climb is coming, so they take a couple of puffs.” Jonathan Leeder, a physiologist with the English Institute of Sport, says many athletes see their symptoms disappear with medication: “However, when medication isn’t effective to alleviate wheezing or breathlessness during exercise, other strategies can be used, like inspiratory muscle training, breathing technique exercises and postural work.” The corollary of athletes getting to grips with asthma is that asthmatic children are increasingly being encouraged to exercise. “We know that children with asthma are often excluded from sport, not by the school but by their parents,” said Deborah Waddell, lead clinical adviser for Asthma UK. “We advise people to take right type of exercise for them.” Dickinson says that more generally, sport can greatly help asthmatics: “It allows you to get a lot more confident about controlling the way you breathe. The sensation of an obstruction you feel when you’re younger has dropped massively. A lot of the athletes who say they had it as a child but don’t anymore, when you do the test they still have a positive test.” Karl Cooke, head of sports science medicine for British Swimming, says swimming is seen as particularly good: “Swimming can be really good as people have to learn a certain amount of breathing control. You need a certain rhythm that isn’t necessarily required in non-aquatic sports. So we have to be careful we also don’t scare people into thinking they’ll develop asthma because of swimming.” Shock diagnosis Aimee Willmott, British swimming champion in the 400m individual medley, was first tested for exercise-induced asthma after she went on a high-altitude training camp and found herself struggling for breath more than her team mates. The test results were something of a shock: “It turned out I was well into being an asthmatic, but I’d just never been diagnosed. With the asthma I was losing 20% of my lung function. It was a shock, but also a relief – I knew what the reason was for getting so out of breath.” Willmott was placed on two different asthma inhalers, a regime now boosted to include an inhaled steroid. The treatment has notably helped her training, she after another recent bout of wheezing explains: “I’ve gone from not knowing why I was struggling for breath to finally getting the right treatment. It’s helped me a lot. I was waking up in the morning out of breath, and struggling for breath in the pool. Now, if I take my inhalers before training it helps me keep it under control.” Her experience, she sayscan be seen as an example to younger sportspeople: “If you’re a child with asthma, but your inhaler regulates it, then it’s not too much of a hassle to do any sport.”",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Why ‘life will go on’ thesis about global economy might not pass muster in 2015", "content": "Russia is in crisis. There are concerns about the eurozone. Japan is struggling to emerge from stagnation. Booming stock markets seem divorced from economic reality. The Anglo-Saxon economies are outpacing the other developed economies of the west. This is the world as it exits 2014. But it was also the world as it was 15 years ago during a month in which the first major anti-globalisation protests took place on the streets of Seattle and preparations were made for the nonexistent millennium bug. Oil prices were low. Banks could lend money cheaply. There was talk of how technology would power a new industrial revolution. It would be a mistake, though, to think that nothing has really changed. The story of the past decade and a half is of the increasingly desperate attempts to prevent the Great Stalling of the global economy. Rock-bottom interest rates have failed to prevent growth rates from slipping. Living standards in many countries are back to the levels of the early 2000s. Securing international cooperation to tackle climate change, to open markets to trade, to manage currencies or to create jobs has become increasingly difficult. The problems of 1999 are still the problems of 2014, but more serious and seemingly more intractable. There is no shortage of explanations for what has gone wrong and what needs to be done to put things right. One view, popular with central bankers and technologists, is that all that is needed is a bit of time. Seen from this perspective, the world is on the brink of the sort of technological shift that happens once in every 50 or 60 years. The transition, however, has been delayed by the structural changes in the global economy caused by the collapse of communism a quarter of a century ago. Adjustment to these geopolitical shifts, such as the rise of China, is taking longer than expected but will eventually happen. Another view is that the zombie-like state of the global economy is owing to a lack of structural reform. Here there is common cause between the German government, which blames the eurozone crisis not on a lack of demand but on supply-side impediments to growth, and the free market economists who say the financial crisis of 2007-08 was caused by over regulation. The solution, therefore, is to make markets work better through reforms that sharpen incentives to work, dilute labour rights, cut taxes, reduce government spending, balance budgets and push back against growing protectionist tendencies. Then there is the Keynesian view of the world. Here, the idea is return, as far as possible, to the world as it existed in the golden years of the 1950s and 1960s. That means governments rethinking their austerity programmes; keeping interest rates low; using redistribution to spread the fruits of growth more evenly; and returning to the sort of managed currency regime that existed until the early 1970s. What is common to the explanations is that they believe there is a short-term (sometimes a medium-term) fix that will put matters right. Growth and a steady increase in living standards has been a feature of the modern industrial world, stretching back to the 18th century: it is quite a stretch to believe that 250 years of progress have come to a halt. As a result, the assumption is that eventually the global economy will achieve escape velocity following several years in the post-global recession doldrums. It is simply a question of pulling the right levers: the European Central Bank getting on with quantitative easing, if you are a US policymaker in Washington; the rest of the eurozone making itself more German, if you are looking at the world from Berlin. It is also thought that the near-halving of oil prices since the summer will speed up the return to the world as it was before the queues formed outside Northern Rock and before Lehman Brothers went bust. The grounds for this belief are that since rising energy costs have historically been bad news for global growth, it follows that lower energy costs must be helpful. This is fine as far as it goes; all other things being equal, lower crude prices will boost consumer spending and business investment in oil-importing countries. But what if not all other things are equal? What happens, for instance, if Vladimir Putin cuts up rough as a result of the impact of falling oil prices on the Russian economy? What happens if losses on derivatives linked to the oil price cascade their way through the global financial system? What if the falling oil price is merely a symptom of a global economy where demand is weak despite the unstinting efforts of central banks? Stephen King, chief economist at HSBC, thinks deflationary pressures were well established long before oil and other commodity prices fell, suggesting the global economy is in relatively poor shape. “Faced with continuously high debt levels, monetary policy appears to have limited traction,” King said. “With interest rates at zero and after years in which central banks have pursued various forms of unconventional easing, there are very few signs of renewed credit growth: it’s increasingly difficult to ignore the echoes from Japan.” Turning Japanese is not necessarily a problem. Japan remains a rich country even after relatively sluggish growth and periodic bouts of deflation during the past 25 years. Living standards will still rise in developed countries; they will simply rise less rapidly than they did in the second half of the 20th century until the arrival of a new technological paradigm leads to a surge in growth. The secular stagnation described by the former US Treasury secretary Larry Summers need not be that bad. But there are two obvious flaws in the “life will go on” thesis. The first is that it is not difficult to envisage the global economy tipping back into recession. Debt, deflation, and massive speculative flows from a largely unreformed banking system are a heady and potentially toxic brew. The second is even gloomier. This is that the economic system that has generated unprecedented prosperity is now irreparably broken. The only way that growth can be generated is through ultra-low interest rates that generate destabilising asset-price bubbles. Even then, growth is weaker than it was and is disproportionately captured by elites who seek to convince the rest of us that things are getting better when they are not. Worse still, the obsession with raising growth rates at all costs means that frightening risks are being taken with the future of the planet. The economist Harry Shutt sketched out this dystopian vision in a recent blog post. His view is that we are at one of those points in history, such as the end of feudalism, where the world is changing but we haven’t realised it yet. Get it wrong, he says, and a new dark age looms.",diasaster:0},

The two works are poles apart in style. The Second, with its quarter tone clusters, spasmodic violence and slithering glissandos, dates from 1968 when Penderecki was still very much an avant-gardist. The Fourth, representative of his late lyricism, is essentially neo-Romantic. It’s dominated by the viola, which opens with a sparsely accompanied arioso before introducing the thematic material for the subsequent three sections: a gnarled, contrapuntal allegro; an andante, in which the cello is allowed momentary prominence; and a folk-inflected finale that fades out on a rhythmic viola monotone. Its brevity, however, tells against it. Where the Second Quartet’s ferocity derives precisely from its compression, the Fourth feels perfunctory, more a sketch or a vignette than a fully developed score. You couldn’t fault the Belceas’ playing of either work. The Second Quartet had real in-your-face intensity, and violist Krzysztof Chorzelski was darkly eloquent in his solos in the Fourth. The evening began and ended, meanwhile, with Schubert. The E flat quartet D87 was beautifully poised, while the Death and the Maiden Quartet, in D Minor D810, found the Belceas at their best in a performance that blended great technical refinement with emotional extremes.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"December strikes do not signify new 'winter of discontent'", "content": "Train drivers are refusing to work across southern England, Post Office workers are planning five days of action in the run-up to Christmas and Argos delivery drivers are poised to down their van keys for 72 hours. Headline writers may well examine the current spate of December strikes and draw comparisons to the “winter of discontent”, which helped bring down the Labour government of Jim Callaghan in 1979. But while such comparisons are tempting, they would be an exaggeration of the powers of Britain’s unions in 21st century, union officials have said. Unions no longer have the financial muscle or the volume of members to bring down the government. Employment laws have all but halted widespread wildcat strikes, secondary picketing and public ballots, which characterised the 70s disputes. But in the two higher-profile disputes, union officials believe that employers are forcing through redundancies and changes to the terms of conditions of workers under the guise of technological changes. The rail strike led by Aslef and the RMT, which has brought the Southern network to a halt and affected 300,000 passengers, was launched because of safety fears over driver-only-operated trains. Despite assurances that that no jobs would be lost, workers fear that the move masks long-term plans to cut staff. The Communication Workers Union says the Post Office strike, due to begin on 19 December, is, in effect, a fight to save thousands of jobs and pension rights. The Argos dispute is different. Observers say it has some parallels with recent disputes involving Sports Direct and Uber in that it involves low-paid workers fighting for basic rights. Unite, the union acting for the workers based at the depot near Burton upon Trent, said each driver was owed about £700 in holiday pay dating back at least two years. There is real concern within the union movement that the government could use the current series of disputes to initiate a new round of employment laws to further limit the scope of industrial action. The Trade Union Act, which became law in May, imposes a minimum 50% turnout in strike ballots, with key public sector strikes requiring the backing of at least 40% of those eligible to vote. But ministers were forced to drop plans that would have curbed Labour’s funding by millions of pounds after a defeat in the House of Lords. The original bill proposed a shift from the current system whereby union members have to contract out from paying the political levy to one in which they would have had to opt in. The plan would have given the unions only three months to get a new member’s signature assenting to the levy. Ministers said on Tuesday that they had no legal power to halt the rail dispute but were publicly entertaining the idea of changing the law, albeit without offering any detail about how the government might do this. Chris Grayling, the transport secretary, said he would look at all the options when the latest strike was over. He wasn’t “ruling anything in”; he wasn’t “ruling anything out”, either.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Spirits soar in Surrey Hills as Silent Pool rides artisan gin boom", "content": "“I’m making something that people smile about and we have won awards. We’re building a brand. It is just fantastic.” So says Ian McCulloch, a former commercial director of ITV who is now playing a part in the UK’s gin boom. McCulloch is the founder and driving force of one of the country’s newest gin brands, Silent Pool, sales of which have trebled in six months. One of a number of artisan gin products eating into the market share of traditional brands, such as Gordon’s, Silent Pool is based in the Surrey Hills near Guildford. It is located on a historic site owned by the Duke of Northumberland, who is said to be an enthusiastic backer of the business. “Demand has just skyrocketed in the past few months,” McCullough says, adding that in a Majestic Wine store in Guildford his firm’s gin accounted for one third of all spirits sales recently. It is quite an achievement for a brand that didn’t exist until just over a year ago – and at around £38 a bottle costs three times as much as a bottle of Gordon’s in Tesco. McCullough first pitched the project of creating an artisan gin business to James Shelbourne, a drinks brand-building expert, in the spring of 2013 over drinks in a local pub, the Onslow Arms in Clandon. By 2014, using their own financial resources, the pair invested in a distillery on a site that used to be a farmyard barn, with Shelbourne as the company’s sales manager. A veteran of the global drinks industry, Shelbourne oversees all aspects of distribution for Silent Pool Distillers. He grew Inspirit Brands from a fledgling marketing and distribution company into a multi-million pound business. UK's 'gin renaissance' continues with sales set to top £1bn for first time Read more After hiring a couple of distillers from Heriot-Watt University’s esteemed brewing and distilling courses in Edinburgh, Silent Pool sold its first bottle of gin in November 2014. It has been a fast-moving journey since then. Six months ago, the business was selling 500 bottles a week and now that figure is touching 1,500. “We’re probably doing about 10 times as much as we prepared for in our business plan,” says McCullough, adding that there is a small crew of wives, girlfriends and boyfriends to be drafted in as extra labour if and when the need arises to help the company meet demand. “People have gone crazy for it locally … a lot of local independent sellers are saying they sell more Silent Pool gin than any other.” Silent Pool is also being exported, to the Netherlands, Denmark, France and Italy, and has recently agreed a deal with Eurostar to help the cross-channel service celebrate its 21st birthday with a bottle called Toujours 21. “We just have to paddle harder,” McCullough says of the growing demand. He attributes the company’s early success to a distinct product that is supported by people who understand marketing and brand building. “A lot of gins look like artisan gins, but they’re not really. We make everything on site. “The pool is spring-fed and there’s lots of local mystery surrounding it.” A woodcutter’s daughter, for example, is said to have met a tragic fate after being so scared by a nobleman on a horse that she swam into deeper water and drowned. The crime writer Agatha Christie disappeared for 11 days in 1926, and when her car was found nearby it was feared she had drowned in the Silent Pool. Retailers such as Waitrose have recently reported growing interest in new gin brands. The supermarket said this summer that it added 27 new gins over the year, and that the fastest sales growth was in the artisan brands. Majestic’s chief executive, Rowan Gormley, said: “There has been a strong growth in craft beer and artisanal spirits. I think there’s been a swing back to authenticity and a bit of a backlash against supermarkets. I think it’s about wanting to connect with people who make real stuff.” McCullough says a change in the rules on still sizes, to allow smaller equipment for the distilling process, has made it easier for smaller firms to enter the market. “That brought the price of equipment down and increased innovation. There’s a lot of people on a gin journey,” he says.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"EU referendum: David Cameron hints vote could be held summer 2016", "content": "David Cameron has signalled that the UK will stage its referendum on membership of the European Union in 2016 and made clear his view that continued membership is vital not just to economic security but to the fight against international terrorism. His remarks, at the close of a two-day EU summit in Brussels, suggest that the prime minister knows he is not going to achieve all his negotiating demands and has decided to press ahead with the vote as soon as a final deal is struck at another summit in February. The referendum is most likely to be staged in July as there are fears in No 10 that the migration crisis may have worsened by next autumn. Cameron knows he has a party management problem now, with the possibility of high-profile cabinet resignations by those who are convinced the package does not change the fundamental contours of the UK relationship with Europe. But he was buoyed by the reception he received at a dinner in Brussels on Thursday when, uniquely for a British prime minister, he was given 45 minutes to persuade the other 27 heads of government of the merits of his case for a new deal for Britain in Europe. Senior EU policymakers taking part in the closed dinner described the outcome as a breakthrough, the first in six months of negotiations, and added that Cameron had gone a long way to winning his argument, paving the way for a detailed compromise deal by February. But Cameron also faced strong resistance from his EU counterparts, particularly to his plans for changes to welfare rules for migrants. The prime minister insisted that good progress had been made towards an agreement in February on reforms to the UK’s membership. But three countries – Belgium, Portugal and Greece – staged a last-minute bid at midnight on Thursday to derail his campaign, demanding that the benefits curbs issue be dropped altogether from the negotiations. They were overruled, but the incident highlighted European resistance to several of Cameron’s demands, problems certain to resurface over the next two months. Cameron has promised to hold a public vote before the end of 2017, but a deal at the summit in February would clear the way for the referendum within six months. He is required to spend six weeks passing details of the legislation through parliament before four months are set aside for the campaign. David Cameron's savvy speech to EU leaders offers hope of referendum win Read more Speaking at a closing press conference designed to generate a sense of momentum, Cameron said: “We’ve made good progress. We are a step closer to agreement on the significant and far-reaching reforms I have proposed. “It is going to be tough and there is a lot of hard work to do. But I believe 2016 will be the year we achieve something really vital, fundamentally changing the UK’s relationship with the EU and finally addressing the concerns of the British people about our membership. “Then it will be for the British people to decide whether we remain or leave. It is a choice we will all need to think hard about. “If we can get these reforms right – and I believe that we can – I firmly believe that for our economic security and increasingly for our national security, the best future for Britain is in a reformed European Union.” Facebook Twitter Pinterest Lectern sign comes unstuck during David Cameron’s press conference. He added: “If you think about the terrorist and security threats we face, and the situation brought about by what Russia has done in Ukraine, [and] the terrorist threat generated by the instability in the Middle East, I think we are better off standing together with our allies and partners in a reformed Europe and that is why, if anything, this negotiation has got more important.” Several EU leaders listening to Cameron’s argument were highly impressed, triggering a mood change about the prospects of striking a deal that could keep Downing Street and the other countries satisfied. There will now be intensive efforts after the new year holiday to find solutions that Cameron can package as a victory in the referendum campaign while not crossing “red lines” defined by the other Europeans and also reaching legal agreements in line with EU law. Despite longstanding demands from No 10 that the EU’s Lisbon treaty would need to be renegotiated to meet Cameron’s terms, Enda Kenny, the Irish prime minister, said Cameron had emphasised to the other leaders that he was no longer seeking treaty change. Asked if he had time to secure a deal by February, Cameron said: “I have been working on this with a clear mandate from the British people since May. What matters is that these changes are legally binding and irreversible. “I want a deal in February. But I have set myself the deadline of the end of 2017 because I wanted to give myself time to get this right – it’s about the substance rather than the timing.” He refused to go into further detail about the nature of the compromise on the issue of banning EU immigrants from receiving in-work benefits until they have been in the UK for four years. But it is clear that he is looking at an alternative, such as an emergency brake that could be applied to these benefits if public services were under severe strain. Cameron tried to broaden the scope of the welfare package to highlight three further elements. He knows that Iain Duncan Smith, the work and pensions secretary, is one of the cabinet ministers most likely to look at the welfare reforms with a forensic Eurosceptic view. He said he was well on the way to ensuring that migrants would not have access to unemployment benefits for the first six months in the UK; anyone unable to secure a job after six months would have to leave; and EU migrants would not be allowed to send child benefit home.",diasaster:0},

{ "title":"Obama runs wild with Bear Grylls to promote action on climate change", "content": "He declined to drink urine but Barack Obama did make tea from glacier water and munch on a bloody salmon previously chewed by a bear in his wilderness bromance with Bear Grylls. The US president trekked through a remote part of Alaska to promote action on climate change – and show a more human side – in a special episode of the British adventurer’s reality show, Running Wild With Bear Grylls. The hour-long programme, which aired on NBC on Thursday, showed the duo bonding as they hiked on Exit glacier in the Kenai mountains, bantering over fatherhood and the environment – as well as flatulence and bellybutton fluff. “I’m skinny but tougher than I look,” said Obama, after the former soldier complimented his physical fitness. It was a moment to make Sarah Palin howl. The president drank tea made from catkins and melting glacier water and munched on a ravaged salmon, which Grylls said had been discarded by a bear and still bore “bear breath”. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Barack Obama discusses climate change in first video on Facebook Grylls has persuaded previous celebrity guests to drink their own urine but the commander in chief demurred. “I suppose, in extremis, it’s something that I would do – if the alternative was death,” he said. “It’s not something I’d make a habit of. And I probably wouldn’t do it just for a TV show.” It was the White House’s idea to pair the professorial president with a rugged survivalist as part of a strategy of unorthodox methods and stunts to project his agenda. It was an Obama seldom seen on television: loose, personal, stripped of pomp, just a guy out hiking with another guy. Of course, it was also an illusion. According to Grylls’ dozens of staff, secret service agents and a food taster hovered just off-screen, along with snipers in the hills and a military helicopter overhead. Perhaps to offset any comparisons with Russian President Vladimir Putin’s swaggering wilderness photo-ops, Obama made several references to the invisible chaperones, including when he fumbled using a borrowed smartphone to take a selfie with Grylls. “I’m in what’s called the bubble and secret service makes sure that I’m always out of danger, which I very much appreciate but it can be a little confining,” he said, addressing the camera directly. “So to be with Bear in the woods: it doesn’t get any better than that.” Both men cited the retreating glacier as evidence of the urgency in addressing climate change. “I’ve two daughters, and I don’t want grandkids too soon, but eventually I hope to have some,” said Obama. “And I want to make sure that this is there for them, not just us.” Q&A: Bear Grylls Read more He said action on climate change was vital to his presidency. “I think it will have a more significant impact on the lives of future generations as just about anything. And we’re still a long way from getting it right but it’s something that, working together, I think we can make a difference on.” The show aired at a delicate time for the president, who is riding high on the climate deal agreed in Paris last week but defensive over Republican claims that he is weak on Islamist terrorism. On Friday he is due to visit the relatives of victims of this month’s San Bernardino massacre. Obama played the straight man, noting Grylls’s reputation for extreme cuisine. “Bear’s a mediocre cook, but the fact that we ate something recognisable was encouraging. Now, the fact that he told me this was a leftover fish from a bear, I don’t know if that was necessary. He could have just left that out.” The Briton commended the president on nimbly starting a fire, obviating need to use bellybutton fluff as kindling. He also recommended the catkins tea as a remedy for flatulence. “It’s not a problem I have but maybe you do,” Obama replied. When Grylls warned that bears were especially dangerous when you surprised them “fornicating”, Obama joked that the same could be said for humans. Clearly smitten, Grylls, an evangelical Christian, ended their outing with a riverside prayer calling on God to bless the president’s work. They hugged and went their separate ways. “He said it was one of the best days of his presidency,” Grylls told reporters earlier this week, according to Reuters. “There were times along the route I had to pinch myself and think, ‘actually, this is the president of America’.”",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Lord Mandelson appointed chancellor of Manchester Metropolitan university", "content": "Six months after trying and failing to be elected chancellor of Manchester University, former New Labour grandee Peter Mandelson has received something of a consolation prize, taking the same job at the city’s newer academic institution. The 62-year-old, who was EU trade commissioner following his 12 years in parliament and subsequently returned to government as Lord Mandelson, will become chancellor of Manchester Metropolitan university from April. He will be succeeding Diane Thompson, the former chief executive of lottery operator Camelot, the university said. In June, Mandelson came third and last in an electronic vote of Manchester University alumni to choose a new chancellor, despite an energetic lobbying campaign by supporters of the former MP for Hartlepool, perhaps still best known as the key architect of spin and news management in the Blair governments. He was beaten by Sir Mark Elder, music director of Manchester’s Hallé Orchestra, and the winner, Lemn Sissay, a poet, broadcaster and playwright who grew up in care. For the Manchester Metropolitan post Mandelson was picked unanimously, albeit by a 20-member board of governors rather than a wider university electorate. Murray said her successor would bring “immense expertise, knowledge and skill to enhance our relationships with business and international partners”. Mandelson said it was “a great honour to be associated with such a successful, world-class university”. He said: “As a former northern MP, I am strongly committed to the vision of Manchester Metropolitan university and to the changes Manchester is undergoing. “The city has the vision, the professional organisation and teamwork to play a key role in radically reshaping Britain’s economy and political system. That was an important project for me in my time in government and so I am delighted to accept this offer to contribute further as the chancellor of Manchester Metropolitan university.” Mandelson had initially been somewhat coy about his chancellorship aspirations, denying to the Guardian in March that he sought the Manchester University post. But after the general election he gave a lecture at its politics department and filmed a short video, now deleted, in which he said he wanted to be part of the university’s “success story”. Sissay produced a rival video in which he performed a poem called Mercurial Graphene, a celebration of Manchester and the wonder substance discovered by scientists at the university. After the election one of Sissay’s supporters described him as an “inspirer”, saying that Mandelson by contrast was a “conspirer”.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Why we should all learn to love paying our taxes", "content": "It is the tax season, the time of year when solicitous faces (Moira Stuart is my favourite) beseech us from billboards not to put off until tomorrow what we should have started last May. I don’t mind it, having no problem with tax; I merely have a problem with the people who raise it, the people who spend it, and the way it is discussed. The problem is not that the main parties have the same attitude to tax, but rather that they have all signed up to the consensus – which has become a “wisdom” – over our attitudes to paying it. There is quite a lot of difference between George Osborne – whose long game, with modest income taxes, swingeing sales tax and no public services, is a neo-feudal scenario in which the poor pay most – and Ed Balls, whose preferred option is for the middle to pay most in order to bolster the incomes at the bottom so that they too may pay tax, and nobody has to make any rude incursions into corporate super profits. Whether or not you agree with either of them, you can concede that there is a bus ride between their two positions. However, they take this as their unquestionable first principle: voters hate to pay tax. The most to hope for is either such profound popularity that voters will do this thing they hate as a favour to you (a distant dream for the current party leaders), or that you can design tax so intelligently that people don’t realise they’re paying it. The minute any politician says the word “taxpayer”, you know the creature they’re conjuring: not an individual with a possible range of beliefs, or a citizen who may take pride in a society built together (with tax), but a person who hates tax in principle. To be someone who pays it is to be someone who resents it. People tend to blame Neil Kinnock’s 1992 tax-and-spend manifesto, sprung at the last minute on an electorate that had been conditioned by years of Conservatism into thinking of taxation as state-sponsored mugging. In fact, the ideas therein were pretty mild – a 50% higher-rate band combined with the repeal of the poll tax and a rise of the lower threshold to remove low earners from the equation. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Former Labour leader Neil Kinnock. Photograph: Don McPhee The vision of tax as a punishment of the rich for the audacity of their wealth, distilled in the phrase “squeeze them until the pips squeak”, was not Kinnock’s but Denis Healey’s. And it was not about the rich – it was about property speculators. His suspicion was that if landlords were left unchecked, Britain would slowly become a rentier economy. Vast and ever increasing numbers of people would be paying unreasonable, verging on impossible, proportions of their wages to a tiny number of landlords. What an old idiot, huh? Thank God nobody listened to him. Research produced after that election demonstrated that Kinnock actually hadn’t lost the vote through his ideas on taxation. There was no great aversion to high-tax plans. The public had no problem differentiating between property speculators and beleaguered slightly rich people whose sterling efforts might be discouraged. These conclusions were all in by 1994, but the myth had gone round the world before the data had put its bow tie on. It is impossible to devise good tax policy on the basis that reasonable people don’t want to pay it and have to be either coerced or conned into doing so. Deduction at source turns into the mug’s option while tax avoidance becomes the natural course of the prudent person. It is often said that HMRC doesn’t have the staffing levels to deal with avoidance as it currently stands, and that’s true – but actually the resources don’t exist in the world to police an activity that nobody believes is wrong in the first place. We have a situation in which world-class tax avoiders have OBEs and honorary knighthoods, and the MPs voting to close tax loopholes are themselves making use of them. There is always room for manoeuvre when tax is seen as a chore not a duty; Bob Geldof often points to the fact that instead of tax he has contributed “ideas”. Andrew Mitchell, one of the highest profile MPs found using a possible avoidance scheme, has since be-skinted himself with a bewilderingly expensive libel case. So that’s all over and there’s nothing to see – the avoidance was cheeky but never wrong. The only figure in public life making a robust moral case for the honest payment of tax is Margaret Hodge. I love Hodge, but she can’t do this on her own. She’s not the Terminator. You cannot collect tax unless you believe in tax; likewise you cannot pay tax gladly unless you love it, not for the useful stuff it might buy but in itself. This is seen as a political impossibility. But why? Tax is no more and no less than an investment in the future. It is no more idealistic than buying an Isa, yet its possibilities are endless. Anybody who has ever salted away 200 quid instead of spending it on a hot-air balloon ride will understand the point of investment. Anybody who has ever joined a round in a pub will see that some activities – drinking is one, building a society is another – are pointless (and quite depressing) unless undertaken collectively. If you consider how proud we are as a nation of the things we have built with tax, it wouldn’t be such a giant leap of the imagination to take pride in the tax itself. But it would be a giant leap of the current political class to put any faith in us to do so.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Surge in illegal sales of drugs as gangs exploit ‘phenomenal market’ online", "content": "The rise of social media and greater internet access through smartphones are factors behind a huge rise in illicit sales of pharmaceuticals, according to the chief enforcement official at Britain’s medicines regulator. Criminal gangs have become adept at using social media to sell “lifestyle” drugs to a mass market at minimal risk and cost, said Alastair Jeffrey, head of enforcement at the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). This year, he said the MHRA had seized 1.2m doses of illegally supplied erectile dysfunction drugs, 383,000 slimming products and 331,000 doses of sleeping pills, tranquillisers and antidepressants – mostly originating from China and India. For the first time, the MHRA pursued YouTube accounts and removed 18,671 videos that directed viewers to websites offering illicit drugs. Many gangs operate through websites that claim to be bona fide online pharmacies. They focus on medicines that people might be reluctant to discuss with their GP or pharmacist, such as Viagra and other erectile dysfunction drugs, as well as slimming pills and hair loss treatments. Sales of anabolic steroids for bodybuilders and cognitive enhancers, some of which have not been tested in humans, are booming. “This is something we are looking at now in a serious way. There is a phenomenal market out there,” said Jeffrey, a former detective chief superintendent who ran the Met’s child abuse investigation command centre. “Smartphones have allowed people greater access to the internet, and all of a sudden this accessibility, combined with social media, has made a significant difference in how criminals reach consumers.” Criminals have moved into the area of prescription drugs and similar treatments because the profits to be made far outweigh those to be made from narcotics such as cocaine, heroin and cannabis. The risks are lower, too, with jail sentences for handling unlicensed or fake medications a fraction of those doled out for dealing in class A substances. Bernard Leroy, director of the International Institute of Research Against Counterfeit Medicines in Paris, said gangs that sold counterfeit drugs stood to make €200-€500 (£390) for every single euro invested. In 2010, the World Customs Organisation estimated that the global market for counterfeit drugs was worth $200bn (£130bn), putting it ahead of prostitution. The combined heroin and cocaine markets are worth $160bn. About half of the drugs sold on the internet are counterfeits, according to the World Health Organisation. Criminal groups use a number of different approaches to make money from prescription drugs. Fake pills can be made from scratch from various powders, including harmful ones. They can be laced with a small amount of the drug’s active ingredient to ensure they pass chemical tests. Some gangs obtain discarded out-of-date drugs and repackage them with fresh dates, or buy cheap generic drugs and resell them after replacing the labels and packaging to make them look like top-brand medicines. In Britain, the MHRA works with internet domain registries, credit card companies, Interpol and sites such as YouTube, Amazon and eBay to identify rogue traders, take down their websites and close their accounts. Raids organised with the MHRA have found drugs ready for shipment stored in appalling conditions. “In many cases they are not stored properly at all. We have had cases where there have been mouse and rat droppings around the blister packs. These people are not interested in sanitary conditions, they are in it for the money,” said Jeffrey. Besides the obvious risks of taking medicines made from rat poison and other substitutes used by gangs, there are also dangers in taking medicines without proper consultation. “There are definitely health risks because a patient might have a condition that means they should not take a certain drug. The problem we have is identifying people who are victims because they don’t say ‘I bought sildenafil on the internet and suddenly got heart palpitations’,” Jeffrey added. Leroy in Paris, said the European commission had compounded the problem by allowing e-pharmacies to operate online. This had led criminal groups, mainly from former Soviet Union states, to set up websites that duped visitors into thinking they were registered European e-pharmacies, he said. “We are in a situation where internet usage is growing so fast that we are at risk of losing control,” Leroy told the Guardian. Gangs that sold counterfeit drugs stood to make between 200 and 500 euros for every single euro invested, Leroy said. In 2010, the World Customs Organization estimated the global market for counterfeit drugs at $200bn, putting it ahead of prostitution. The combined heroin and cocaine markets are worth $160bn. About half of the drugs sold on the internet are counterfeits, according to the World Health Organisation.“This will become a major issue for public health in coming years. People are more and more focused on obtaining these medicines and people are going to the internet for them.” In July, Dutch researchers published a report in the British Medical Journal on the success of thousands of rogue online pharmacies. Led by the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment in Bilthoven, the study measured levels of sildenafil, the active ingredient in Viagra, in sewage from Amsterdam, Eindhoven and Utrecht. After comparing the levels found with those expected from official dispensing records, the scientists concluded that at least two-thirds of the drugs in use came from illicit sources, most probably online pharmacies. A spokesperson for YouTube said users posted 300 hours of content every minute of every day to its servers. If viewers suspected that videos were promoting illegal goods, they were asked to report the account to a team of YouTube reviewers. eBay said its sellers were prohibited from listing prescription drugs, in line with its medicine and healthcare products policy. “In addition to our own filters and other technology, eBay works closely with the MHRA and other regulators across the globe who have a direct line to eBay and enable us to remove any listings of concern as soon as they are reported,” a spokesman said.",diasaster:0},

The prospect of the first “radical leftwing” government assuming power in the EU is, I fear, only a remote possibility, not because Syriza’s policies do not attract sufficient support in Greece but because austerity in Europe is now clearly judged to be much more important than democracy; the chances of an imminent general election taking place in Greece are remote. Only if Greek MPs fail to elect the government candidate as president will an election be called, and as the Greek prime minister equates this failure with “political turmoil”, everything possible is being done to ensure the candidate becomes the new head of state (Greek election uncertainty fuels concern over eurozone stability, 18 December). Bribes of €2m-€3m are being offered to ensure votes are cast “correctly”; seven leaders of the neo-Nazi Golden Dawn party are being allowed to participate in the election, even though they have been imprisoned for using their fascist group “as a front to run a criminal organisation”; and, as Jones reported, veiled threats are being made, to Greek politicians and people, by the president of the European commission, Jean-Claude Juncker. The fact that the likely victor of the election is a party committed to ending austerity and to ruling Greece on behalf of its people, not its banks and financial interests, explains why, in Jones’s words, “a democratic challenge to economic madness” is being “strangled to death”. Ironic, isn’t it, that when politicians attempt to justify their needless wars, the “threat to democracy” is viewed as having paramount importance, but when democracy in Europe is threatened because it could result in a national government favouring anti-austerity policies, no mainstream politician bats an eyelid?

The labels of our new Christmas jumpers, novelty socks, toys and mobile phones reveal the global trade in manufactured goods and the huge distances they travel. Shipping is more energy efficient than road or air transport, but a lack of controls on ship exhausts and the poor quality of marine fuel mean 15% of global nitrogen oxides and 8% of sulphur gaseous pollution come from ocean-going ships. This matters because 80% of shipping is within 400km of land, and major sea corridors and ports are large pollution sources. In Hong Kong, the world’s fourth largest port, daily changes in ship pollution have been linked to heart attack frequency. Ship pollution can also be found in smaller port cities such as Cork, Gothenburg and Brisbane. Marine fuel is mainly residues from refining road and aviation fuel, and therefore contains most of the impurities. Vanadium emitted from ship funnels can be found in the air throughout Europe – in Paris and London, for example. But the greatest impact of shipping pollution in Europe is felt in Denmark and the Netherlands. Much of waters around the US and Europe are now pollution control zones for ships, requiring them to burn better quality fuel. This does help. Reduced sulphur in fuel from 2006 led to cleaner air in Dover and Rotterdam. However, growth in shipping and increasingly stringent controls on land-based pollution sources mean ship pollution is set to grow as a proportion of our pollution exposure.",diasaster:0},

As a ceasefire came into effect late on Tuesday to allow the evacuation of the final opposition-held areas, medical charities warned that medics who had stayed in east Aleppo could be treated by Syrian government forces as rebel supporters. Until now the only way out of the besieged areas was into government controlled parts of the city. For doctors and nurses that has been a particularly high risk, because they have been heavily targeted for their work and as symbols of the opposition since the early days of the uprising against Assad. “Doctors have been targeted since the beginning of the crisis for doing their medical duty. Those who chose to stay in Aleppo, the heart of the opposition, are at severe risk in government areas,” said Dr Zaher Sahloul, a Syrian-American doctor who has worked in Aleppo and is the former president of the Syrian American Medical Society. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Syrian pro-government forces in Aleppo after they captured an area in the eastern part of the city. Photograph: George Ourfalian/AFP/Getty Images Some medical staff seem to have disappeared in the turmoil of Aleppo’s fall, but Sahloul said he hoped plans to evacuate civilians to remaining rebel-held areas could save the lives of men and women who had selflessly risked their own for so long. “Many of the doctors refused to leave when they could, because they said, ‘Who will take care of the civilians if we leave’,” he said. “Now we have tried to work with the Russian, US and Turkish governments to see if they can be evacuated with the injured to other rebel-held areas, where they will feel safe.” Non-medic civilians living in the final rebel-held districts are equally terrified of reprisals from a government known for its ruthless treatment of anyone it considers an opposition supporter. “All we got from our friends in Aleppo this morning are their wills because they are waiting to be killed or arrested by Assad forces.

Four years ago the government went a step further, making it a crime for medical staff to treat anyone connected with the opposition. “The regime passed a law in 2012, that anyone who helps someone in the opposition, including doctors and nurses, will be considered terrorist.

{ "title":"Rogue One: A Star Wars Story review – a sleek addition to the fleet", "content": "This latest exhilarating, good-natured and enjoyable adventure from the Star Wars imaginary universe is written by Chris Weitz and Tony Gilroy, and directed by Britain’s Gareth Edwards; it comes from a time which now doesn’t seem so very long ago. The film’s action occurs some time between Episode III: Revenge of the Sith and Episode IV, A New Hope. So it’s a mid-quel or a deja vu-quel. Character archetypes, mythic confrontations, desperate hologram messages, dads real and quasi-, uniforms and hairstyles are always rising recognisably to the surface. Like superhero films or westerns or romcoms, Star Wars invented its own recurring generic components, and to complain or even notice now seems almost as beside the point as recognising familiar chord progressions in the blues. It is noticeable that the newish motif of the defector or renegade, which featured in The Force Awakens, pops up again here. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Rogue One: A Star Wars Story – video trailer Rogue One has a kind of associate membership status with the projected nine-film club; it doesn’t count as a fully fledged episode, but an auxiliary story, an offshoot of the canon, a sleek fighter cruising alongside the main fleet – though of comparable size, shape and manoeuvrability. Felicity Jones plays Jyn Erso, a courageous, fugitive rebel who happens to be the daughter of Galen Erso, the brilliant scientist, designer and Oppenheimer figure behind plans for the Empire’s terrifying new weapon, called a “Death Star”: he is played by Mads Mikkelsen with his familiar air of martyred machismo. Daughter and father endured a terrible trauma; Jyn is close to the extremist rebel-dissident Saw Gerrera (Forest Whitaker), and Galen finds himself working for the Empire’s chillingly fanatical administrator, Krennic – a pleasingly unpleasant performance, facially tense and clipped, from Ben Mendelsohn. But whose side is Galen actually on? And when Jyn finds herself destined to steal the Death Star plans and command a rebel ship code-named Rogue One, she must team up with another insurgent, Cassian Andor, played by Diego Luna, whose own hidden agenda she realises when it’s almost too late. Felicity Jones is in the tousled-yet-game tradition of Star Wars female leads, like Carrie Fisher or Daisy Ridley: well-born but determined, with a sense of purpose befitting an heiress, if not a princess. The comedy robot this time around is K-2SO, a reprogrammed Empire droid, voiced by Alan Tudyk, who is less obviously dapper than C-3PO. K-2SO is hulking and dark, more like Ted Hughes’s Iron Man in miniature, but with a droll way of objecting to orders; his style in backtalk involves a nicely timed deferred punchline. The arms are long, resulting in an almost knuckle-dragging, simian way of walking. In his taciturn way, K-2SO could almost be a quasi-Chewie presence. Elsewhere in the cast, there are signs that, whatever xenophobes like Donald Trump think, China is making a valuable contribution. Other fellow travellers in the rebel world include Baze Malbus, played by Jiang Wen, and Chirrut Imwe, played by Donnie Yen, who brings a martial artist’s poise to this blind figure who uses his hyper-acute hearing and sense of the Force to negotiate his way around. Rogue One’s Ben Mendelsohn: ‘Star Wars is a childhood dream come true’ Read more Rogue One doesn’t really go rogue at any stage, and it isn’t a pop culture event like The Force Awakens, in whose slipstream this appears; part of its charm resides in the eerie, almost dreamlike effect of continually producing familiar elements, reshuffled and reconfigured, a reaching back to the past and hinting at a preordained future. There are some truly spectacular cameos from much-loved personae, involving next-level digital effects — almost creepily exact, so that watching feels at various stages like going into a time machine, back to the 80s and 70s. If there is anything new in Rogue One, it is that there is much more of an emphasis on the Death Star’s nuclear effect. In other films, we’ve seen this weapon blow up planets, and the calamity was almost abstract; now a prototype is blowing up cities. The implied comparison arguably makes light of a serious subject, but there is a beady-eyed fervency with which Rogue One deploys this catastrophe, and portrays the sacrifice needed to prevent it. Its variations on a theme are muscular and adroit. This is another really entertaining fantasy with fan-fiction energy and attack.",diasaster:0},

{ "title":"No wonder more babies are being taken into care – today’s cultural climate makes that horribly inevitable", "content": "What could be worse than spending your life rolling a boulder up a hill each day, only to have it roll back down again each day? Actually, completing a pregnancy each year, only to have your baby taken from you each year, sounds considerably worse. But new research into newborn care orders confirms that one British woman has given birth 16 times to babies who have been removed from her. Here is horror at its most mundane. Here is the term “self-destructive cycle” made flesh. The worst thing? There can be absolutely no doubt, surely, that the woman locked into this compulsive cycle is not fit to be a mother. To care for children you have to rearrange your life. But there is no rearranging going on here. The same mistake is repeated, again and again and again, with the same abject result. This is the stuff of nightmares. The case of this particular mother of 16 is the most extreme of those highlighted in new research from the University of Lancaster. But it is not uncommon for women who lose their baby to a care order to become pregnant again quickly, and to lose a baby again. The research interviewed 72 women, and found that on average they had four children who had been taken into care. Are we failing parents whose children are taken into care? Read more It’s the most vicious of circles. The removal of the child makes the desire to have another irresistible, while at the same time the emotional damage from losing the child makes competent motherhood all the less likely. The huge shock is that these women – many of them very young – have no statutory right to help or support after their baby has been taken from them. One small charity, Pause, has been set up to try to tackle the problem, which otherwise has been given scant attention until now. Ken Loach did make a film in 1994, Ladybird, Ladybird, which told the story of a mother in an abusive relationship, who had six children taken from her, one of them at birth. It was sympathetic to the plight of women who lost babies to the care system, and the woman in the film – which was based on a true story – did eventually have two babies with a new, supportive partner, that they kept. But it seems that since then, things have got much worse, not much better. The research analysed family court records, and found that there has been a huge rise in the number of newborn babies taken into care in England in recent years. In 2008, 802 babies were taken into care. In 2013, it was 2,018. Between 2007 and 2014, a total of 13,248 babies were taken into care. The researchers say there is no clear, particular reason that explains the “disproportionate” increase. But it’s hard to resist the idea that a lot of it is simply down to cultural climate. A lot of things have happened which might have contributed to such a situation developing. The high-profile case of “Baby P”, who was killed by abuse and neglect in his home in August 2007, not only made it clear that it was very difficult to protect a child within a home, but also that the public didn’t have much sympathy for social workers who had tried and failed to do that ultra-hard task. More generally, there has been a growing awareness that even without deliberate abuse, simple neglect is extremely damaging to a child’s psychological development. Until recently, it was considered best to keep a child in her home environment as long as she wasn’t in physical danger. Attitudes have hardened as research has uncovered the damage caused by neglect alone. Further, there has been governmental pressure for some time now, due to the parlous life chances of young people emerging from the care system, for adoption to be pursued with more enthusiasm. In the past, people who wanted to adopt babies, not older children, were often seen as a bit sentimental, picky or selfish. But the truth is that adopting abused or neglected children is hard. Adoptions of older children do sometimes break down, damaging a troubled kid even further. And all that was in the air even before austerity became the order of the day. Cuts to the public sector have impacted worst on mothers and children, decimating both programmes such as Sure Start, which supported children, and the social fund, which supported their parents. Help for women experiencing domestic violence is literally shrivelling away, with many organisations being forced to cut staff or even close. Family Rights Group has already warned that children are at greater risk of being taken into care as funding to support people experiencing domestic violence dwindles. The worst thing about all this, in a way, is that it’s logical. Children with poor life chances are being taken from risky situations at the earliest possible time. The likelihood of them being able to thrive in a stable environment is therefore increased. It’s all very practical. The only problem is that it’s a moral outrage. Can this be what we want? A society in which things are made as tough as possible for the poor and vulnerable, all the better to take their babies from them, in the full knowledge that there are likely to be more babies where that one came from? It sounds like a ghastly vision of dystopia. But this is Britain, now.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"NHS hampered by poor management structure, Rose report claims", "content": "The NHS is being hampered by an over-complex management structure which is quashing initiative within the service, a delayed government report by the former Marks & Spencer chief Sir Stuart Rose is expected to conclude. The report was due to be published in November but is now expected early in the new year before the general election and amid growing concerns about the pressures being placed on hospital accident and emergency departments. Ministers are concerned that Rose’s report will be seized upon by critics of the coalition’s NHS reorganisation because it says or implies that some of the changes have made an already complicated structure even more unwieldy. Rose is expected to conclude that the NHS is staffed by dedicated employees with a willingness to improve but who are held back by a system that includes poor practices for managing, training and developing people. The role of the much criticised regulator the Care Quality Commission is expected to come in for a further beating, the report saying it has contributed to turning the NHS into what he has described as “a multi-headed hydra”. It is also expected to criticise the way the federated structure of the NHS allows underperforming managers to move from one hospital to another with little attempt to debar or retrain them. In appointing Rose last February, the health secretary said he wanted the former retail boss to focus on how to change the culture in underperforming hospitals. He also insisted the review would exclude the politically sensitive issues of ownership structures, outsourcing and the use of the private sector in providing care. Sir Stuart, now chairman of Ocado, started working at M&S in 1972 as a trainee, rose through the ranks to become chief executive in 2004 and left the firm in 2011. On his appointment to lead the inquiry, he admitted the NHS is a very different institution from M&S, but said: “Leadership, motivating staff and creating a culture where people are empowered to do things differently are crucial to the success of any organisation.” Since then his understanding of the dedication of NHS staff has grown but he has been struck by the way underperforming senior managers are paid off only to appear at another hospital in a different well-paid guise. His report comes as it has emerged that more than 3,000 operations have been cancelled by the NHS in the first two weeks of this month owing to “unprecedented demand”. Figures reported by the Sunday Times show 3,113 elective operations were cancelled in that period, up by almost half on the same period in 2012 and by 16% on the first two weeks of December 2013. On 8 December, 410 elective operations were cancelled – the single worst day so far this winter and 100 operations more than last winter’s peak figure. Of operations classed as urgent, 161 were cancelled in the two-week period, with some having been cancelled twice or more. The figures, highlighted by Labour, show the repercussions of A&E departments under severe stress and a lack of beds for patients in need, said Shafi Ahmed, a consultant general and member of the Royal College of Surgeons. “There is currently unprecedented demand on the NHS resulting in more cancellations of planned surgical operations. “As a practising surgeon, looking after cancer patients, it is very difficult to have to tell a patient who has prepared themselves for a major procedure that their operation has been cancelled for non-clinical reasons. “To reduce pressures on hospitals and to keep a flow of patients coming in and leaving hospital, we need to manage the number of available beds more efficiently. To achieve this, we need to reduce unnecessary admissions and visits to A&E and improve community care.” Ahmed said improvements were also required regarding discharge arrangements, to avoid patients staying in hospital longer than necessary, and said ringfencing of beds for high dependency care should be considered. The shadow health secretary, Andy Burnham, said: “This is yet another sign that, under David Cameron, the NHS is simply not working. “Standards of patient care are slipping by the week and now more and more people get ready for an operation only to face a last-minute postponement. “The chaos in A&E is spreading through the NHS. Hospitals are in danger of becoming overwhelmed as the government takes social care away from older people and makes it harder to see a GP. These cancellations help to explain why operation waiting lists are at a six-year high.” The Department of Health told the Sunday Times the figures show “the proportion of cancelled operations remains remarkably stable over many years”, adding that more operations are being carried out amid an ageing population.",diasaster:0},

{ "title":"Brian Lemon obituary", "content": "For the better part of half a century, Brian Lemon, who has died aged 77, was the jazz pianist of choice for British all-star groups, as well as for visiting American instrumentalists, a player feted on both sides of the Atlantic for his sensitivity as an accompanist and his creativity as a soloist. There seemed no limit to Lemon’s capacity to play “something ear-catching”, in the writer Dave Gelly’s words, whether in impromptu groups or more organised ensembles – that is, until chronic osteoarthritis in his hands put an end to his pianistic career 10 years ago. Lemon was born in Nottingham, where his mother, Selina, and father, Leonard, were semi-professional dance-band violinists who both worked for the cigarette manufacturer John Player & Sons. Inspired by Fats Waller and later by Art Tatum and Teddy Wilson, Brian studied the piano with Reg Conroy, a local teacher, and was soon proficient enough to perform in palais bands in his home city. Aged 19, he moved to London in 1956 to join Freddy Randall’s lively Dixieland band, moving on a year later to the tenor-saxophonist Betty Smith’s quintet, with which he made his recording debut in 1957. Thereafter, Lemon seemed never to be short of a gig, playing and recording with the very best names in British and American mainstream jazz. He accepted engagements whenever and wherever they occurred, never histrionic or flashy, sitting quietly at the keyboard, with the inevitable cigarette in the corner of his mouth, its ever-lengthening ash a constant source of interest. “It was important,” he told his son, Ian, “to know when not to play.” Based in London for the remainder of his career, Lemon often toured overseas, on one occasion with the comedian Tony Hancock, and was with the always adventurous Fairweather-Brown All Stars from 1961 to 1963, before subbing for Dudley Moore at the Establishment Club. Regularly aligned with leading players including the tenor saxophonist Danny Moss and the innovative trombonist George Chisholm, he also played at the singer Annie Ross’s club, Annie’s Room. He was with the Scottish cornettist Alex Welsh’s superb band for three years from September 1975, his cleverly constructed solos like a temperate counterpoint to their full-on Dixieland attack. Often leading his own groups, Lemon was on call for radio broadcasts and was adept at writing for strings, his arranging abilities underplayed but always valued by fellow professionals. Once American stars began to tour the UK regularly, Lemon was in continuous demand, cementing relationships with the cornettists Ruby Braff and Warren Vaché, the clarinettist Kenny Davern and, most tellingly, the saxophonist Scott Hamilton. He became a key member of Hamilton’s “British quartet”, along with the bassist Dave Green and the drummer Allan Ganley. Speaking of Lemon, Hamilton stated firmly: “Whoever said he is a national treasure was absolutely right.” Facebook Twitter Pinterest Moonglow by the Brian Lemon Trio, recorded in 1999-2000 It was no surprise when Lemon, a man who named Wilson among his favourite pianists, was picked to play with Benny Goodman, Wilson’s former employer, on the clarinettist’s UK appearances in the 1970s. He once told me of a late-night encounter with Wilson in which they exchanged keyboard runs; some of Wilson’s popped up later in Lemon’s solo routines. Having worked off and on with the drummer Phil Seamen and John Dankworth, Lemon was wholly at ease with more modernist American stars, performing with the vibist Milt Jackson on three occasions and appearing with the bassist Ray Brown in BBC2’s Masterclass series, before reverting to the mainstream style with the ostentatiously named World’s Greatest Jazz Band in Europe. Lemon’s later associations included a stint with the Rolling Stones drummer Charlie Watts’s bebop quintet, alongside the young star Gerard Presencer on trumpet, the altoist Pete King and Green. Watts’s celebrity brought high-profile engagements for his band in Japan and America, Lemon handling the trickier bebop material with his customary aplomb, and doubtless enjoying Watts’s first-class travel arrangements. Other long-term affiliations were with the Pizza Express All Stars from 1980 on, with the singer Val Wiseman’s attractive tribute package Lady Sings the Blues, based on Billie Holiday’s repertoire, and with the trumpeter Kenny Baker’s Best of British concert attraction. In a remarkable final flourish to Lemon’s career, the businessman John Bune created the Zephyr label in 1994 specifically to feature him. With their bright, lemon-yellow livery, the resulting 27 albums stand as the definitive tribute to Lemon’s prowess as arranger, bandleader and soloist, his filigree skills deployed in duets and special band lineups. Sadly they were also to prove his swansong as an active musician. Lemon, who was married but separated, is survived by his partner, Susan Burgess, and by Ian and a grandson. • Brian Lemon, jazz pianist and arranger, born 11 February 1937; died 11 October 2014",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Competing biopics to chart lives and romance of Danish royal couple", "content": "She has been described as the Australian Kate Middleton, while he is a more follicly gifted Prince William. Now the lives of the Danish crown princess, Mary, and the crown prince, Frederik, are to be depicted on screen in 2015 with two television projects charting their lives and romance. Neither project has been approved by the palace, but Mary: The Making of a Princess is billed as a “true life fairytale” about how Australian Mary Donaldson met Prince Frederik at a Sydney pub in 2000. Her prince will be getting the biopic treatment in Frederik’s Young Years – focusing on his playboy reputation in the 1990s. The latter is directed by 36-year-old actor/screenwriter/director Christian Tafdrup, who played the dastardly TV executive Alex in the final series of Borgen (Danes in showbusiness tend to multitask). Despite Tafdrup’s royal project being unauthorised, the Danish ministry for cultural affairs has contributed 200,000 Danish kroner (about £21,000) towards script development via the Danish Film Institute. “It’s an ambitious project for me,” said Tafdrup. “I haven’t yet directed a feature film [he is to direct his first full-length feature in January] and I’ve got to make 10 years of Crown Prince Frederik’s life into one believable story. But I’ve got a good relationship with the film institute from working on short films for them, so I guess they trusted me to do a good job.” The government funding is indicative of the country’s relaxed attitude and irreverence towards its royals. While most Danes wouldn’t describe themselves as monarchists, Queen Margrethe is the most popular monarch in Europe with approval ratings of 70%. “We tend to feel close to our royals in Denmark,” said Tafdrup, “and they come across as quite normal. There’s a lot of gossip about them in magazines, but I was interested in the idea of Frederik as an ordinary guy, like the rest of us, who was just born into this really different life.” Frederik’s Young Years will chart the life of the prince between the ages of 22 and 32, featuring previous flames including former Danish MP Malou Aamund and model Katja Storkholm as well as Frederik’s meeting with his future wife during the 2000 Sydney Olympics. “I’ve spoken to a few people close to Frederik with his permission,” said Tafdrup, “but it’s a tricky area. I understand that the palace may not want me to do this film but my intention isn’t to be rude – I’m interested in creating fiction based on facts. It’s a universal story about what it’s like to be a young man coming of age, set in a royal environment – it’s definitely not a royal soap opera.” The competing biopic on the royal couple may not have such lofty ideals – it’s being produced by Fremantle Media Australia, the company behind the teatime telly classic and students’ favourite Neighbours. Mary: The Making of a Princess is about how difficult it was for the Tasmanian-born estate agent Mary Donaldson to adapt to royal life and how the “happy-go-lucky girl from Hobart” transformed into a royal renowned for her sense of style. Australian actors Margot Robbie, 24, and Rose Byrne, 35, are the frontrunners to play Mary, according to Australia’s Gold Coast Bulletin, but Fremantle Media’s Sydney publicity manager, Adrian Motte, insisted there was everything to play for. “We haven’t cast yet or shot a frame and we don’t have a director that we can announce at this stage but the project is being overseen by Fremantle Media Australia’s Head of Drama, Jo Porter. Jo oversees all of FMA’s drama output, including Neighbours,” said Motte. Most Danes seem untroubled by the impending explorations of their royal family. But after a recent spate of regal film flops, everyone will be hoping that their royal power couple won’t be handled in the vein of Grace of Monaco, Diana, or worse Hallmark’s 2011, William & Catherine: A Royal Romance – a film reviewed by the Guardian’s Stephen Bates as “toe-curlingly, teeth-furringly, pillow-bitingly ghastly”.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"UK inflation hits highest level in more than two years", "content": "UK inflation climbed to 1.2% in November, the highest level in more than two years, in a sign that the fall in the value of the pound since the Brexit vote is fuelling a rise in the cost of living. The rise in the consumer prices index, from 0.9% in October, was largely driven by higher petrol and clothing prices according to the Office for National Statistics. November’s rate was the highest since October 2014, and slightly above the 1.1% forecast by City economists. UK petrol prices set to rise after Opec deal Read more Frances O’Grady, the TUC general secretary, said rising inflation posed a threat to living standards in the UK. “Working people are facing over a decade of lost wage growth, with rising prices hitting their pay packets again. The government needs to act fast to avoid another living standards crisis. That means a clear plan for Brexit that will protect jobs, pay and rights.” UK inflation rate UK inflation rate Economists said the rise in the headline inflation rate suggested a weaker pound was pushing up consumer prices by making imports more expensive. Alan Clarke, economist at Scotiabank, said: “There was a scattering of monthly increases for exchange rate sensitive components that were higher than the seasonal norm. This to me represents the early signs of the pound’s depreciation feeding into the inflation data. There is plenty more where that came from.” Economists, including those at the Bank of England, have warned that inflation is likely to rise sharply in 2017, to about 3%, putting increased pressure on household finances. Richard Lim, chief executive at the consultancy Retail Economics, said shops faced a choice between passing rising costs on to consumers, taking a hit on margins, or passing them on elsewhere in the supply chain. “Most retailers will use a combination of all three to distribute the impact of rising input costs but households will have to share some of the pain,” he said. “How much pain and how quickly it feeds through will be critical in determining the strength of spending next year.” Higher inflation in 2017 is expected to coincide with a period of poor wage growth, rising unemployment and weaker economic growth all adding to the pressure on household finances. Higher prices for winter coats were largely behind a 1.6% increase in the cost of clothing between October and November. Petrol prices increased by 1.6p a litre between October and November this year, but fell by 1.5p a litre a year ago. Other items contributing to higher inflation in November were leather sofas, bleach, pizza, computers and printers. Some manufacturers of IT equipment said the weaker pound was pushing up prices because products were usually priced in dollars. ONS figures also showed the prices paid by manufacturers for materials and energy continued to rise at a brisk pace on a year ago. They were up 12.9% from November 2015, the biggest rise for five years. They appeared to pass some of that on to clients, with output prices up 2.3% in November on a year ago, the biggest rise since April 2012. The ONS said recent moves in the pound had fed through into firms’ costs and charges made to their customers and “to a lesser extent” into some components of the consumer prices index that tend to be imported, such as fuel. Statisticians also said the drop in the pound had amplified the effect on inflation from a rise in global oil prices. Mike Cherry, national chairman at the Federation of Small Businesses, said higher costs were hitting companies. “Our members have so far managed to absorb the increased costs resulting from inflationary pressures but the effects are now beginning to bite. Many small businesses rely on road travel to transport goods, receive supplies and for their staff to get to work so the rising cost of petrol is a major concern.” Responding to the inflation data, the Treasury said: “The economy remains fundamentally strong with taxes cut for millions of working people and the employment rate at a record high. The autumn statement set out support for an economy that works for everyone, as we adjust to our new relationship with the EU.”",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"How to make a profit from defeating climate change", "content": "From rising sea levels to more severe storms and more intense droughts, climate change will present serious risks to, and create major opportunities for, nearly every industry. Citizens, consumers, businesses, governments, and international organisations are all taking action. And entrepreneurs are developing disruptive technologies that will create and destroy value. Michael Bloomberg to head global taskforce on climate change Read more The challenge is that investors currently don’t have the information they need to respond to these developments. This must change if financial markets are going to do what they do best: allocate capital to manage risks and seize new opportunities. Without the necessary information, market adjustments to climate change will be incomplete, late and potentially destabilising. Public policy, consumer demand and technological innovation are driving a shift towards a low-carbon economy. Which companies and industries are most, and least, dependent on fossil fuels? And who stands ready to provide resilient and sustainable infrastructure? Which financial institutions are best positioned to gain and which to lose? In every case, which firms have the governance, resources and the strategy to manage, and profit from, these major shifts? We believe that financial disclosure is essential to a market-based solution to climate change. A properly functioning market will price in the risks associated with climate change and reward firms that mitigate them. As its impact becomes more commonplace and public policy responses more active, climate change has become a material risk that isn’t properly disclosed. In response to a G20 request to consider the financial stability risks, the Financial Stability Board created a taskforce on climate-related financial disclosures. Its purpose is to develop voluntary, consistent disclosures to help investors, lenders and insurance underwriters manage material climate risks. As befits a solution by the market for the market, the taskforce is led by members of the private sector from across the G20, including major companies, large investors, global banks and insurers. After a year of intensive work and widespread consultation its recommendations are now publicly available. They concentrate on the practical, material disclosures most relevant to investors and creditors and which can be compiled by all companies that raise capital as well as financial institutions. Facebook Twitter Pinterest President Hollande of France (right) and Ban Ki-moon, the then UN secretary general, (centre) celebrate last year’s Paris climate agreement. Photograph: Christophe Petit Tesson/EPA We are pleased that all taskforce members, companies with market capitalisation of $1.5tn and financial institutions responsible for assets of $20tn, have announced their support for the disclosure recommendations. We encourage others to participate in the consultation, to become early adopters thereafter, and to encourage the companies in which they invest to also make the disclosures. A year ago in Paris, 195 countries committed to limit the rise in global average temperatures to less than 2C. With better disclosure, a market in the transition to that world can be built. That market will expose the likely future cost of doing business, of paying for emissions, and of changing processes to avoid both those charges and tighter regulation. And it will help smooth price adjustments as opinions change, rather than concentrating them in a short, dangerous space of time. Of course, given the uncertainties around climate, not everyone will agree on the timing or scale of adjustments required to achieve this goal. But the right information will allow optimists and pessimists, sceptics and evangelists, to back their convictions with their capital. Early disclosure rules allowed 20th-century financial markets to grow our economies by pricing risks more accurately. The spread of such standards internationally has helped lift more than a billion people out of poverty. Climate-related disclosures could be as transformative for 21st-century markets. • Catch up on the discussion about this article in our Your Opinions thread.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Trial of Jakarta governor Ahok begins as hundreds of Islamic hardliners protest", "content": "The much anticipated blasphemy trial of Jakarta’s Christian governor Basuki Tjahaja Purnama has opened amid tight security and mobs of Islamic hardliners chanting for his arrest. Hundreds of protestors, some dressed in white Muslim garb, gathered outside the court in the Indonesian capital for the first day of the trial, demanding the governor be jailed for allegedly insulting Islam. Jakarta governor Ahok's blasphemy trial: all you need to know Read more Ahok, as he is better known, has caused intense anger in Indonesia over recent months after he referred to a verse in the Qur’an on the campaign trail in September. Citing Al Maidah 51 from the Islamic holy book, the straight-talking mayor told voters they should not believe religious leaders who claim the Qur’anic verse forbids Muslims from being led by non-Muslims. He has since repeatedly apologised for his statements. Ahok, a Christian and member of the country’s ethnic Chinese Indonesian minority, is an anomaly in the world’s largest Muslim-majority nation. In an emotional speech in court, Ahok said it was never his intention to cause any offence and insisted his comments were aimed at politicians “incorrectly” using the Qur’anic verse. “As a person who grew up in Islamic circles, is not possible for me to insult Islam,” he told the court. Stressing his deep respect for Islam, in his statement to the court and five sitting judges, Ahok also mentioned his beloved Muslim godparents, saying that insulting Islam was akin to causing deep offence to his own family, an infraction he would never willingly commit. “What I said was not intended to insult Al Maidah 51, let alone blaspheme Islam or offend Muslims,” he said. “My remarks were directed at politicians who use Al Maidah 51 incorrectly, because they don’t want to compete in elections in healthy way.” He broke down in tears twice during his statement in which he recalled how he helped poor Indonesians to perform the Hajj pilgrimage when he was a district chief a decade ago. Ahok was responding to the official charges of blasphemy, after they were read out by prosecutors. Under Indonesia’s 1965 blasphemy law, Ahok faces a maximum five-year jail term if found guilty. The Ahok trial is being closely watched, and is viewed by many as a crucial test of Indonesia’s commitment to religious tolerance and diversity. With three mass rallies against Ahok since October, the case has also drawn concerns of ‘mob justice’, the ability of the masses to pressure the Widodo administration and influence judicial outcomes. Ahok’s lawyer told reporters on Tuesday the governor is being trialled by the mob. The protests over recent months, one that turned violent, were organized by a newly formed coalition of Islamist groups called the National Movement to Guard the MUI Fatwa (GNPF-MUI). Among those most prominent in the new coalition are members of a well-known hardline group, the Islamic Defender’s Front (FPI), widely seen as a group of Islamic thugs. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Indonesian Muslim protesters shout slogans during a demonstration outside of the court. Photograph: Mast Irham/EPA By seemingly bowing to pressure from the masses, and even agreeing to pray with hardline leaders at the last mass protest this December, President Joko Widodo has set a dangerous precedent, argue some analysts. “I didn’t agree that the president join the rally because it legitimates people who for a long time have insulted him, undermined him and caused chaos,” noted Hendardi, chairman of the Setara Institute for Democracy and Peace. “I deplored the action because it gives the impression that pressure from the masses can become law, that the law on its own does not work,” he added. Ahead of the election for Jakarta Governor next February, a race that Ahok is also contesting, analysts have also suggested the case against him also has a strong political dimension. The trial has been adjourned until 20 December. Associated Press contributed to this report",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Meet the vicar who’s swapping the sacristy for the surgery", "content": "For rector Sarah Lunn, it’s only a stone’s throw from the small sandstone church of St James to the purpose-built surgery in the tiny Cumbrian village of Temple Sowerby where she often meets troubled parishioners referred to her by one of two GPs. The secret life of a GP: a family doctor is there for everyone else’s before their own | Anonymous Read more Lunn, who looks after 12 agricultural parishes nestling between the Lake District fells and the Pennines from her home base at Long Marton, is not at the surgery to talk to patients about Jesus, but simply to listen to whatever they feel they need to get off their chest – and at the same time take the pressure off struggling local primary health services. The GP practice run by doctors Jo Thompson and Helen Jervis is up against it – like many others in Cumbria – because it is two doctors down and can’t attract anyone else to replace them, despite the beauty of the area. A report on the difficulties facing the region indicates that 47% of GP partners are planning to retire within the next 10 years and a third of practices have applied to NHS England for vulnerable practices funding because of the high ratio of patients to GPs. Health service managers in Cumbria are drawing up plans to recruit refugee doctors to work as GPs and the area is offering trainee GPs “golden hellos” of £20,000 on top of their salaries, in a bid to fill gaps. The free service that Lunn offers is for any local resident (whether a churchgoer or not) who needs to talk but does not need to see a doctor. Quite simply, if Lunn talks to patients who have been going to their local surgery on a regular basis to chat, the GPs she works with find that these people stop asking for doctors’ appointments. “It’s going back to the way that it was in the past, when the GP and the minister worked together to look after families’ wellbeing,” says Lunn. “It is all about trust. Because our rural community is small and everyone knows everybody, the vicar is not just for those who go to church. I’m the vicar for everybody.” As part of a scheme called the Listening Ear, the project emerged from Lunn’s participation in a church leadership programme which helps lay and ordained leaders from all denominations to develop creative, entrepreneurial skills to operate more effectively in rural areas. Lunn knew that doctors in her area were hard-pressed, so she sought a placement with the Temple Sowerby practice – and the idea was born. Another three years of development and wrangles about safety and confidentiality issues followed before its launch in September 2014. Lunn is respected and trusted in this tight-knit, sheep-farming community, because she keeps sheep herself Listening Ear now comes under the auspices of Cumbria Council for Voluntary Service, after being vetted by Cumbria Clinical Commissioning Group, and involves 12 clergy (including one Methodist minister) covering five GP practices in the Eden Valley. More want to join even though they are not paid to do it. In Temple Sowerby, patients who Thompson and Jervis think might benefit are offered the chance to see the rector at the surgery. If they are willing, Lunn contacts them to fix an appointment. Most of the issues she deals with are related to bereavement, isolation or making a difficult decision. So far, Lunn has seen 12 people. In all, Listening Ear has helped more than 50. This may not seem big numbers but, as Lunn says, “it represents a shift in mindset by GPs”. Aren’t there some issues that it may not be appropriate to discuss with a person of the cloth, such as whether or not to have an abortion? Lunn says a young woman came to her with this dilemma. She gave the woman the chance to air her thoughts in a safe place, without it being repeated around the whole district, where everyone knows everyone else. She is clear that she is not there to give her religious views (unless they are asked for) or to pass judgment. As Jervis explains: “There is a big stigma about anything like anxiety around here and you cannot be anonymous in this community.” Lunn is both respected and trusted in this predominantly sheep-farming area, because she keeps sheep herself (grey-faced Dartmoors called Pinky and Perky) at the back of her rectory, alongside guinea fowl and blue and black runner ducks. At the parish coffee morning she can move easily between farmers and other locals, picking up news of who is not well, who is suffering from falls in stock prices and who has died. Any concerns can be taken back to the relevant surgery for a GP follow-up. “I thought we would have a problem with the religious bit,” Jervis admits. “But Sarah is high-profile round here because of her work during the Cumbrian floods and her support for the Gypsies, and they trust her.” Building on the project’s success, the Temple Sowerby practice has plans to run a dressings clinic in the nearby village hall to coincide with the church coffee mornings, to which people are brought from local farms and villages by volunteer drivers. And Lunn, representatives of the local clinical commissioning group and NHS England have been discussing how Listening Ear could be rolled out across the NHS. It is not the only intervention by the church in health and social care, as services come under sustained pressure. The bishop of Carlisle, the Rt Rev James Newcome, is developing Caring for Carers, with the Church of England’s mission and public affairs director, Brendan McCarthy, to harness the social support being given informally by church members to people caring for those with dementia and other chronic conditions, in order to turn it into a national scheme. Newcome is the House of Lords spokesman on health, lead bishop on health and healthcare, and member of a Lords select committee looking at the sustainability of the NHS. He is clear that what he calls “low-level” initiatives like Listening Ear make a significant difference to people’s health and wellbeing. “People have got to get real and appreciate the fact that we are facing a £3bn deficit in the NHS – and that things we have had in the past may no longer be available in the future,” says Newcome. “We have to do things that are not expensive, but that will bring help and comfort to people.”",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Ampleforth College: charity watchdog to investigate handling of abuse claims", "content": "The Charity Commission has launched an investigation into safeguarding and the handling of sexual abuse allegations at a prestigious independent Catholic boarding school in North Yorkshire. Police have been investigating allegations of historical sexual abuse at Ampleforth College, which has educated cultural luminaries such as the Downton Abbey creator, Julian Fellowes, the sculptor Antony Gormley and the actor Rupert Everett. Announcing its inquiry on Tuesday, the commission – which is the independent regulator of charities in England and Wales – stressed that its role was not to investigate allegations or actual incidents of abuse, whether historical or recent. Its remit is solely to look into the trustees’ approach to safeguarding and their handling of allegations of sexual abuse. Ampleforth Abbey, a registered charity, is the home of a Catholic religious community which is based on the same site. The St Laurence Education Trust is the registered charity which runs Ampleforth College and a second independent school, St Martin’s Ampleforth. The Charity Commission will examine whether there has been any misconduct or mismanagement in the administration of the charities; the charities’ handling of safeguarding policy and procedures, and how they dealt with the risks to the charities and their beneficiaries arising from alleged abuse incidents. “The commission stresses that it is not a safeguarding authority and its inquiries will not investigate allegations of abuse or actual incidents of abuse, whether historic or recent,” it said in a statement. “Its concern is with the proper regulation of charities. Anyone with concerns about specific incidents of alleged abuses, whether historic or recent, regarding any charity, should report their concerns to the police and the relevant safeguarding authorities.” A report will be issued once inquiries have been concluded, the commission added. An Ampleforth spokesperson said trustees were cooperating fully with the commission, adding: “Ampleforth is strongly committed to good governance and a January 2016 inspection by the Independent Schools Inspectorate found the college to be fully compliant with regard to all aspects of safeguarding. “In addition, an independent audit of the abbey trust’s safeguarding commission carried out by the Catholic Safeguarding Advisory Service on behalf of the National Catholic Safeguarding Commission in June 2015 endorsed the work of that commission in safeguarding children and vulnerable adults.”",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Nato ends combat operations in Afghanistan", "content": "After 13 years of war, Nato formally ended its combat operations in Afghanistan on Sunday, leaving the Afghan army and police in charge of security in a country plagued by continued fighting, a ferocious insurgency and a rising tide of both military and civilian casualties. Against a backdrop of violent clashes in a number of provinces and several weeks of deadly attacks on the capital, military leaders lowered the flag of a mission conceived in 2001, and hoisted the colours of a new one under which Nato’s role will largely be restricted to training, advising and assisting the local army and police. “Our Afghan partners can and will take the fight from here,” said General John F Campbell, the commander of the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) at a ceremony in the capital. As insurgent attacks have increased in many parts of the country in 2014, Afghan forces have already been leading the fight in recent months – but at a high price. More than 5,000 local security forces have been killed this year alone, the highest toll since the war began. In comparison, the international coalition has suffered a total of 3,485 deaths since 2001. “The Afghan national security forces had to suffer losses this year that are too high,” ISAF’s deputy commander Lieutenant General Carsten Jacobson said, speaking to reporters after the ceremony. “Now that [the Afghan forces] have taken over the tactical fight, losses lie on them.” Between 17,000 and 18,000 international troops will remain in Afghanistan after 2014, of which 12,000 - including approximately 470 British troops - will form part of the new Nato mission, named Resolute Support. An additional 5,500 US soldiers will perform different roles, including counterterrorism and logistical assistance. At their peak in 2011, international forces numbered close to 150,000. The international coalition’s biggest achievement has been to help build a 350,000-strong security force in Afghanistan from scratch. But they are still ill-equipped, particularly when it comes to air support and intelligence gathering. In the future, US troops will continue to provide air support in what they call “extreme situations.” In the past year, Afghan troops have asked for aerial assistance approximately 400 times, but received it in 30 cases. Sunday’s ceremony took place at the headquarters of ISAF, which has increasingly turned into a fortress as the security situation in Kabul has deteriorated. In the wake of the recent elections and uncertainty over the military transition, insurgents have unleashed a wave of attacks on the capital. 2014 was not only the bloodiest year of the war for Afghanistan’s security personnel, but also for its civilians. According to a recent UN report, close to 10,000 civilians have been killed or wounded. “There is a lot of concern for the rise in civilian casualties,” said Hadi Marifat, a Kabul-based analyst with the Centre for Civilians in Conflict. “The more territory the Taliban tries to occupy in the coming years, the more civilian casualties there will be because of military confrontations.” But, despite the ever-intensifying war, optimism prevailed at ISAF headquarters. “We now enjoy considerable momentum, as we enter 2015,” said Campbell, citing higher life expectancy, education and more women in the workforce as tangible evidence of Nato’s contribution. “There is no turning back to the dark days of the past.” Another challenge facing the Afghan security forces is gaining trust of the people. The Afghan forces have long been criticised for heavy-handed methods against civilians. And with Nato withdrawing from the battlefield, there will be less monitoring of their methods, and of civilian casualties, said Marifat.Foreign troops have gradually learned how to limit civilian casualties over the past 13 years, said Marifat. “The key issue for ISAF now is to transfer those lessons learned to the Afghan national security forces, so they don’t repeat them,” he said. The signing in September of two security pacts between the Afghan government, Nato and the US brought renewed optimism to the country. But since the formation of the national unity government at around the same time, all political decisions in Afghanistan have been put on hold due to the government’s inability to form a cabinet. Afghan national security advisor Hanif Atmar, who signed the security agreements, also spoke at the ceremony on Sunday, expressing gratitude to the international forces for their sacrifices. “The Afghan people pray for your fallen, wounded and their loved ones,” Atmar said to the international delegates. “We will never forget your sons and daughters who have died on our soil. They are now our sons and daughters.” Lending a phrase from president Ashraf Ghani, Atmar said: “Afghanistan is now awakening from a 40-year-old nightmare.” However, he also offered sobering words as a reminder that although Nato is seeking to end combat, the war is not over. “The threat to our shared national security interests and our shared civilisation is morphing. New non-state actors have emerged in the region in the past couple of years to pursue a deadly campaign against innocent people and the state system,” Atmar said. “We do not want or expect that you will support us indefinitely. However, we need your partnership and support now more than ever.”",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Flood memories continue to haunt residents as stormy winter takes hold", "content": "“The surreal thing was watching the swan swim up to my window,” says June King. In early February, her home was flooded. It turned the life of the self-confessed home-bird upside down, ruining her possessions and forcing nine months away in temporary accommodation. “People can’t imagine what it means.” King lives in Willow Way, a pretty cul-de-sac of bungalows, just off Thames Street, in Lower Sunbury. The river, with its high banks, flows slowly eastwards at the end of the close, where boats tie up. King was one of the thousands across the country who were flooded in last winter’s deluge. But almost a year later many of their homes remain barely habitable and stress levels remain high. Residents remain fearful that another stormy winter will bring further flooding. Opposite King’s home, Jacqui Bryce is sitting in the only room in her bungalow that has been renovated so far. The rest of the house remains a building site. “The flood was mentally traumatic,” she says. “Everything I have worked for since I was 15 I lost. I was in tears.” Bryce’s floors are now being raised by 25cm. “It is lucky we had high ceilings,” she says. Another neighbour, Tina Kirby, remembers the evacuation. “We did 12 hours of putting stuff in bags and putting it on boats,” she says. As well as her three children, Kirby had pets to rescue, a dog, two cats, a rabbit, four chickens and a tank of fish. “Putting those on the boat was fun,” she says ruefully. Facebook Twitter Pinterest A flooded area of Willow Way in Sunbury, February 2014 Photograph: Jacqui Bryce But the impact of the flood lingered long after the skies had cleared and the flood water had subsided. “My daughters were doing their GCSEs and A levels, and they lost all their course work,” Kirby says. One daughter then spent months getting up at 5am in order to get the school in time from the house they had to rent. Even when they finally got back into their house and turned the heating on, the plaster on the walls started cracking. “It is not just losing your home, you lose the community around you too,” says Bryce, who has lived there for 17 years. She was forced out on the weekend of the flood. “We had to phone a friend, like refugees.” The community was subsequently scattered into rented homes and hotels across the region. Bryce was only able to return in early November. It takes months for homes to dry out, before renovation can even begin. During that time Bryce had to install CCTV to deter burglars who were seen casing empty properties in the area. But, in a small silver lining to the storm clouds that brought the floods, the Willow Way residents feel generally well served by their insurance companies. “We’ve had no complaint so far, though they were a bit overwhelmed at the beginning,” says Bryce, whose premium has not been hiked, to her relief. She is concerned, however, about whether her home’s value will have been blighted: “The house was going to be our pension.” Facebook Twitter Pinterest Flooded homes in Sunbury-on-Thames. Video by Sujata Kirby Bryce is scornful of the promise David Cameron made at the height of the floods. “He said ‘money was no object’, but of the £5,000 ‘renew and repair’ grant, £3,500 alone will go on moving the energy meters higher. The government are not taking it seriously. They are looking at it piecemeal.” “People say you should not have bought a house near the river, but in this country you are always near a river or stream,” Bryce says, adding that the homes were already raised and had water storage space underneath. “We can only do so much ourselves.” Groundwater started rising in Willow Way in January, like a slow torture. “It had been holding us hostage for weeks: will it, won’t it?” says Kirby. But there was no warning of the final flood from the Environment Agency, the residents say, and they believe the local weirs and sluice gates hadn’t been maintained properly. They also criticise the local council. “They arrived with sandbags the day after the flood, and then the guy had no boots,” says King. The memory of the flood is not fading, says Kirby: “You spend every day it rains worrying, is the river rising?” All the residents are now improving the flood protection on their homes, including barriers and pumps, some funded by the EA.

{ "title":"Local courts need to be run by local people", "content": "Labour’s idea to create “pop-up courts” in town halls and civic buildings (Report, 26 December) is a good one. Local justice has been destroyed in many areas, due to the closure of magistrates courts. The MP Simon Reevell recently pointed out that someone from Wensleydale trying to get to their nearest court in Northallerton for a morning hearing would not get there till after midday if they used the local bus service. Courts need to be nearer the communities they serve, and local control should be restored to them. Before 2003, when magistrates courts committees were abolished, magistrates controlled the administration of their local courts. Now it is centralised and neither magistrates, nor councillors, nor local people have any real say in how local justice is administered. If pop-up courts are to succeed, local people need to run local courts.   Penelope Gibbs Director, Transform Justice  • Earlier this year the Guardian printed my letter attacking the coalition government for suggesting pop–up courts so as to reduce the number of courts and undoubtedly sell the buildings off. Sadiq Khan has now stolen this idea. The idea is Kafkaesque, absurd and will remove the gravitas that emanates from the justice system. I suggest maybe the politicians try selling Westminster Palace, 10 Downing Street and other buildings used by the legislature, as the gravitas they are supposed to have has completely disappeared. The Commons, the Lords, the parliamentary committees and the cabinet could pop up in various places where they would not be remote from the people. Besides, if Sadiq Khan and the Labour party were serious about removing the remoteness of the justice system, then they should abolish the fees in the employment tribunals and sort out the legal aid problem which is denying loads of innocent people access to the justice system.

{ "title":"Blood-swept lands: the story behind the Tower of London poppies tribute", "content": "There were many happy twists of fate that led to the most visited and talked about public art installation for a generation, not least the fluke discovery of a remarkable sentence in an unknown soldier’s will and a fortunate case of mistaken identity. But ultimately the poppies at the Tower of London happened because of one artist’s powers of persuasion. “I do talk people to death until I get an answer,” admitted Paul Cummins. More than 5 million people are estimated to have visited Blood Swept Lands and Seas of Red during the four months it appeared in the Tower’s moat. It was a deliberately simple idea. To commemorate the centenary of the outbreak of the first world war there would be 888,246 ceramic red poppies gradually planted until 11 November. Each represented one British or colonial life lost. By the end there would be a sea of red. Then they would disappear. The crowds who gathered to see the installation were large and at times surprising. It became so popular towards the final weeks that David Cameron and Boris Johnson led calls for it to be extended so more people could visit. The reaction was overwhelmingly positive but there were detractors, chiefly the Guardian’s visual arts critic Jonathan Jones. He called it “a deeply aestheticised, prettified and toothless war memorial.” The Daily Mail responded with a ferocious piece headlined: “Why DO the Left despise patriotism?” Not everyone was so extreme in their views. There were Guardian as well as Daily Mail readers among the Tower crowds and there were many highly placed people in the art world who looked on the installation with affection. In recent weeks t he chairman of Arts Council England, Sir Peter Bazalgette, said he thought the work would be remembered in 100 years’ time. Another senior figure in the art world said that if Jeremy Deller or Rachel Whiteread had been responsible, the entire contemporary art establishment would have fallen over itself to praise it. Some have said it should be considered for the Turner prize. Paul Cummins (right) ceramic artist, and Tom Piper, set designer, the two men behind the first world war memorial of ceramic poppies. Photograph: David Levene/Guardian At the centre of this maelstrom are Cummins, the ceramic artist who dreamed up the idea, and Tom Piper, the theatre designer who was brought on board by the Tower to stage the piece. Neither is holding their breath for a Turner nomination. “It is not going to happen,” said Cummins. “Probably if it had been anyone else, yes.” Piper added: “Paul’s ‘a Derby-based artist’ and I’m a theatre designer and ‘not an artist’, although I beg to differ.” The seeds of the project can be seen in the ceramic roses that Cummins created during the Cultural Olympiad in 2012, one of the Unlimited projects by disabled artists. The idea for the poppies came as he went through first world war archives in Chesterfield records office. By chance he found the will of an unknown soldier who died at Flanders which contained the line (he uses an app to have things read to him): “The blood-swept lands and seas of red, where angels fear to tread.” “It was an accident I came across it and it just sparked something in my mind,” said Cummins. “I am horrendously dyslexic and I do see things in a different way to everyone else, because words to me are colour. To see the actual note brought back memories of red.” Cummins had the brainwave of making an installation with ceramic poppies representing each of the dead, so he rang the Tower of London. He got through to the Tower’s head of operations, John Brown, but only by chance, “because he knew somebody else called Paul Cummins”. Things then began to move fast. “I do talk people to death until I get answer and actually it didn’t take that long. It was a couple of weeks and they said yes. It all blossomed from there.” Piper, a freelance who works regularly at the Royal Shakespeare Company, was brought on board in autumn 2013 by Deborah Shaw, the head of creative partnerships at Historic Royal Palaces, to work out how to stage the idea. He had the idea to create the Weeping Window, a cascade of poppies that spilled from a window, and the Wave, which swirled out of the moat to form an arch over the entrance to the Tower. Volunteers remove poppies from the moat of the Tower of London. Photograph: John Stillwell/PA The whole project still had to be agreed by the HRP trustees and this came with a crucial advocate in the shape of Lord Dannatt, the former head of the army who holds the ancient title of constable of the Tower of London. The man in charge, in other words. So why did it work, in the eyes of many, so well? Piper said: “It has been an amazing and, at times, difficult journey and we’ve had to adapt. Initially, we thought we might plant the poppies in three weeks and it became clear that couldn’t happen, so we ended up with the slow planting which in the end made it better. “It became part of the work that it was always in a state of flux, always flowing. There was a great sense of theatre from the people planting, the people watching and then every night the roll of honour.” Cummins said the gradual planting meant using thousands of volunteers and their stories – whether they lost someone in a conflict or have sons and daughters serving abroad – have become part of the piece. Then there are the numerous photographs taken by the public. “Everybody felt they could own it and of course a lot of them do now own it because they paid £25 for a poppy,” said Piper. An estimated £10m has been generated for six charities from the sale of the poppies with the process of packing them up beginning the day after the Armistice Day anniversary, despite the pleas of politicians for the whole work to stay longer. Instead the Weeping Window and the Wave remained until the end of November and will tour the UK until 2018, when they will be given to the Imperial War Museums in London and Manchester. Cummins and Piper are adamant that the installation had to end when it did, that its transience was part of its power. But Piper added: “We were working behind the scenes before the politicians got involved about how we could preserve the Wave and the Weeping Window.” Both men have invested an enormous amount in the poppies project – Cummins lost a finger in machinery for rolling clay – and are looking forward to new projects, not involving poppies. Both, it is predicted, will feature in the New Year honours list. It would be wrong to say the men were not stung by criticism of the work, chiefly that of Jones. In his blogpost Jones wrote: “War is not noble. A meaningful mass memorial to this horror would not be dignified or pretty. It would be gory, vile and terrible to see. The moat of the Tower should be filled with barbed wire and bones. That would mean something.” In a follow-up he mentioned artists who have produced great work – Otto Dix or George Grosz – in all its horror. “It was a massive shame that certain people had to force their own opinions on other people,” is Cummins’s forthright view. “It would have ended up looking like The Rocky Horror Show if we’d have done what he wanted us to do.” Piper said it was good to have a debate: “The letters and messages I’ve had have been from across the boards, from all walks of life, from all countries. It has spoken to something very personal in people and allowed them to engage in their emotions and the people who couldn’t see that, I just feel they didn’t open themselves up to what it was all about. “They felt they had to make some intellectual comment about it, when actually it was so simple and beautiful.” • This article was amended on 31 December 2014.

{ "title":"The year the grassroots took on the powerful – and won", "content": "Injustice is sustained by many things. One is a sense of inevitability: that it’s just one of those ugly, painful things life throws at you. Another is resignation: the mantra of “there is no alternative”, a general lack of hope that things could be different. And then there’s intimidation: that the powerful are too strong to be overcome, that resistance is more likely to end in more suffering rather than positive change. That life is often busy and stressful enough without attending protests and meetings, with children to raise and bills to pay, similarly complicates attempts to challenge the status quo. But if the past 12 months taught us anything, it’s that the otherwise faceless or ignored can organise against power, and win. Take the national scandal of poverty pay. Politicians have never been so committed – in rhetoric – to the principle of a living wage, even as they have presided over its disappearance in practice. A child growing up in poverty is more likely to live in a working household than not; and last year, the Resolution Foundation tells us, the ranks of the low-paid swelled by 250,000. A rational government would boost the minimum wage and restore collective bargaining rights for trade unions to lift workers out of poverty. But in 2014 there were workers who did not wait for enlightened politicians to assert their rights. Workers at Brixton’s Ritzy cinema took strike action, built a broad public coalition, defied threats, and forced management to offer a big pay rise without job cuts. Workers at Curzon cinemas pulled off the same feat. Housing is one of the great crises of modern Britain. Social housing waiting lists, overcrowded homes, insecure tenancies, unaffordable private rents as wages are squeezed, houses treated as assets rather than a basic right: here are the realities for millions. A campaign led by working-class mothers in Newham challenged all that: the Focus E15 women occupied flats in protest at evictions, and to demand council housing. In the face of opposition from the Labour mayor, Sir Robin Wales, they won a moral victory in the courts and a commitment from the authorities to house homeless people in the flats. Suddenly, the housing crisis had a national platform. Members of the group E15 Mothers staged a sit-in at the Carpenters estate in east London. Photograph: Jay Shaw-Baker/Demotix/Corbis The same goes for the New Era estate in Hoxton, whose residents faced being taken over by the rapacious Westbrook property developers, and seeing their social rents raised to unaffordable levels. Rather than accept the move, they organised. Under concerted pressure, Westbrook sold the estate to the charitable Dolphin Square Foundation, apparently saving the tenants from eviction and extortionate rents. Although it has been suggested the victory could prove short lived and rent increases could eventually come, here was a story of a multinational company with wealth and connections being defeated by a grassroots community campaign dominated by working-class women. All of the above show that collective pressure from below can succeed. In the era of Twitter, campaigners who are used to being ignored or demonised by newspapers no longer have to depend on the mainstream media to get their message across. And after years of progressive campaigns almost becoming accustomed to defeat, these victories could inspire others to take action. When people now enduring injustice see others winning, then resignation, intimidation and all the other factors that help maintain the status quo are eroded or even overcome altogether. Politics is often portrayed – particularly by those at the elite level – as a top-down affair. That is rarely more true than during an election year. In 2015 one of the most venomous election campaigns in modern times beckons: the passion of the arguments will disguise the fact that the main political parties disagree on all too little. The key protagonists will be drawn from a narrow social background; professionalised politicians will dominate. I happen to be among those who believe that the vote was a desperately hard-won right, and is one key instrument for social change. But democracy is so much more than an occasional trip to a polling booth. Our rights and gains, constantly imperilled as they are by the powerful, were won not only by voting but by organising, striking, demonstrating and, yes, breaking the law. After a year when victorious grassroots campaigning made a defiant comeback, it would be a travesty if the general election allowed top-down politics to reassert itself entirely. An election year actually provides a potential new opening for grassroots politics, giving campaigners new leverage. The danger is that 2015 will become an almighty Ukipfest, with mainstream politicians focusing on bashing immigrants, benefit claimants, public-sector workers and other favoured Daily Mail targets. If British politics was reasonable or rational, the contest would be about solving the housing crisis, raising wages in a sustained way, creating secure jobs that have dignity and rights, achieving tax justice, and at least debating the underlying assumptions behind austerity. If these issues are to be discussed with any seriousness, then it would be utterly naive to imagine politicians will engage of their own accord. People must surely organise from below. This is how otherwise ignored voices will be heard too. Nobody could claim with any honesty that Westminster is a fair reflection of Britain. It is overwhelmingly male, disproportionately privileged, and lacking in minority or disabled voices – all of which helps to shape the priorities of our politicians. But grassroots campaigns last year were dominated by working-class women. Surely few demographics have so little voice in mainstream politics. And yet the unheard forced the powerful to listen. They did not see their fights as isolated but as part of a broader struggle. If the cartel of British politics is to be broken, then these campaigns will have a crucial role. Britain is a country where the strength of your voice depends on the amount of money in your bank account. But politics should not be a soap opera at the top. So for those of us who still believe in genuine democracy, 2014 was punctuated by hope. The housing crisis and poverty pay were tackled not by our politicians but by people from below. If democracy is to be reborn, and if politics is not to be kept relentlessly on the terms most favourable to the powerful, other such campaigns must flourish. Working-class women and low-paid cinema workers became leaders last year. Now it’s time for the rest of us to follow.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Gambian military takes over offices of electoral commission", "content": "Yahya Jammeh, the autocratic ruler of the Gambia, has moved to resist his presidential election defeat, sending armed soldiers to take control of the electoral commission headquarters and filing a petition to the supreme court as a delegation of African leaders urged him to stand down. The petition said the electoral commission had “failed to properly collate the results” of the election, which Jammeh lost to challenger Adama Barrow. It came after the president of the electoral commission was thrown out of his office shortly before the leaders’ delegation arrived in the country. “I got there by quarter to eight and when I was going up to my office, one of the cleaners told me they were not allowed in,” Alieu Njie told the Guardian. “I went to my office and a military man came and said I was not allowed to touch anything, so I took my briefcase, got into my car and went home. “Let’s just hope and pray that now these heads of state are here President Jammeh will decide to step down. The only legal way is for him to step down.” The Gambia's president urged to accept defeat by new government Read more Making up the most important delegation ever to descend on the Gambia, the presidents of Nigeria, Liberia, Sierra Leone and Ghana flew in on Tuesday to meet Jammeh, who has ruled an increasingly isolated nation for 22 years and last week vowed to stay on despite losing the presidential election. Asked if Jammeh had been receptive after their hour-long closed-doors meeting, the Liberian president, Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, said that no deal had been reached. “We come to help Gambians find their way through a transition. That’s not something that can happen in one day. It’s something that one has to work on.” Sirleaf said that Jammeh had assured the delegation that “peace and stability will remain in the Gambia, as the transition process proceeds to a conclusion”. Until now, Jammeh has refused to see dignitaries who have come to the Gambia to try to mediate between him and president-elect Barrow, a former estate agent who led a coalition of eight opposition parties to defeat Jammeh, sparking celebrations in the west African country. Jammeh surprised many when he initially accepted defeat in a televised call to Barrow on 2 December but he made an extraordinary televised U-turn, in which he said that the election had been “fraudulent and unacceptable”, and then deployed extra troops on the streets. Adama Barrow, the president-elect, told the Guardian he was “not so disappointed” that there was no deal yet. “These are very important heads of state from Africa, and in their countries they will always accept the will of the people. I think he will listen to them,” he said. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Gambian president-elect Adama Barrow in Banjul. Photograph: Afolabi Sotunde/Reuters “The best thing is for [Jammeh] is to accept the reality – that he has lost the elections.” On Monday, the chairman of the regional west African organisation the Economic Community of West African States (Ecowas) said that if persuasion did not work, it would consider sending in the military. “We have to use persuasion to get Mr Jammeh to respect the principles,” Marcel de Souza told RFI. “After that, we will see about putting on pressure via the UN security council, the AU [African Union] and Ecowas in order to avoid conflict. “And if none of that works, we will consider more draconian options. We have done it in the past. We currently have troops in Guinea-Bissau. We have had troops in Mali. And therefore it is a conceivable solution.” Sirleaf did not respond to questions about a possible military intervention, saying only: “We hope that the will of the people will prevail.” Although the country’s chief of defence staff, Ousman Badjie, said last week he would support Barrow, he told the Guardian on Tuesday that Jammeh paid his salary, so he had the backing of the armed forces. “I’m supporting the commander-in-chief of the Republic of the Gambia – of the Islamic Republic of the Gambia – whosoever it may be,” he said. “My job is security, to make sure this country is peaceful and is secure, that is my primary role and that is what I’m paid for. As we speak now, I’m paid by the government of the day, that is Yahya Jammeh’s government. He’s my commander-in-chief as we speak now. I have only one commander-in-chief as we speak.” Hamat Bah, one of the party leaders in Barrow’s coalition, said he thought Buhari had the best chance of changing Jammeh’s mind, as he was a military man. “Remember, President Buhari is from the military. Jammeh is from the military. I think that will make a difference,” he said.",diasaster:0},

On Monday, the employment minister, Fátima Báñez, announced a push to let Spaniards knock off at 6pm, rather than the current 8pm. The government has also said it is willing to consider, as part of a series of measures designed to improve work-life balance, reversing the Franco-era decision that put Spain in the wrong time zone. Happy hour: Balearics try to keep summer time as Spain turns back the clocks Read more “We want our workdays to finish at six o’clock and to achieve this we will work towards striking a deal with representatives from both companies and trade unions,” she told parliament. “Someone’s got to take the first step and that’s why I’m asking for the support of the biggest companies and the trade unions.” At the moment, Spanish workers start their day around 9am, break for coffee mid-morning and then work until 2pm. The lunch break lasts two or three hours, after which they return to work until about 8pm. Such a late finish means that dinner isn’t eaten before 9pm. After a couple of hours of TV, people tend to go to bed around midnight. Proponents of change argue that a working day built more around agricultural labour than the office-based reality of most of 21st-century Spain has taken too large a toll on people and productivity for too long. It is not the first time that calls have been made for a thorough overhaul of the working day. Three years ago, a parliamentary commission recommended the introduction of a more regular, 9-to-5 day. The commission also suggested returning the country to its proper time zone. Although Spain used to be on the same time as the UK and Portugal, it has run an hour ahead since 1942, when General Francisco Franco shifted it forward in solidarity with Hitler’s Germany. Facebook Twitter Pinterest General Francisco Franco changed Spain’s timezone in 1942 to match Hitler’s Germany. Photograph: REX “We call it the religious working day: you start work when God wants and finish when he wants,” said Professor Nuria Chinchilla, director of the International Centre for Work and Family at Spain’s IESE Business School. Chinchilla said the negative consequences of a tired workforce extended far beyond the balance sheet. “It’s awful and it affects people’s ability to look after their children and spend time with them after school; we’re also sleeping an hour less than we should be, so we’re less productive given the hours worked and there are more accidents. It’s really irrational and that’s why we’re campaigning for it to be fixed.” She said turning back the clocks and introducing a 9-to-5 day would yield swift and obvious benefits: “If we turn the clocks back, it’ll get darker earlier and so people will want to go home earlier. It would also be good for the body and people would work better and more productively.” Details of the government’s plan are unclear, but the People’s party, which was returned to office in October after 10 months of political paralysis, has already won the support of the opposition Socialist and the smaller Ciudadanos (Citizens) party. The move comes a year after the Catalan government committed itself to becoming the first region in Spain to align its working hours with the rest of Europe. Catalonia’s new working day, designed to improve work-life balance, is expected to begin in September 2018. In October, campaigners in the Balearic islands urged Madrid to let them stay on summer time rather than putting the clocks back along with the rest of Spain. They pointed out that the Balearics see the sunset almost an hour earlier than western parts of the peninsula and that businesses and people suffer as a result. The Més per Menorca coalition said that keeping the islands on the same time as mainland Spain was based on “obsolete industrial” concerns, adding: “Modern society needs the hours of daylight to adapt to its leisure time.”",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Record number of journalists in jail globally after Turkey crackdown", "content": "More journalists have been imprisoned this year by governments around the world than at any time in nearly 30 years, primarily because of the crackdown in Turkey after the failed coup in July. According to the annual survey compiled by the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), there were 259 journalists in jail as of 1 December, and at least 81 of those were in Turkish prisons. All of the editors, writers, cartoonists and photographers detained in Turkey are facing anti-state charges, the press freedom organisation said in its report. Stop the press: Turkey's crackdown on its media goes into overdrive Read more It is believed to be the highest number of journalists ever held in one country at one time. Dozens of other journalists are imprisoned in Turkey, but CPJ was unable to confirm a direct link to their work. Some observers, as Elif Şafak noted in a New Yorker essay, believe the total could be as high as 140. The CPJ report states: “In Turkey, media freedom was already under siege in early 2016, with authorities arresting, harassing, and expelling journalists and shutting down or taking over news outlets.” A state of emergency has been in force in Turkey since the July coup attempt and the resulting government crackdown on alleged coup sympathisers has landed thousands in jail and forced tens of thousands of people from their jobs. Western governments, human rights groups and legal experts have repeatedly expressed concern over events in the country. In a two-month period, the Turkish government led by President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan detained more than 100 journalists and closed down at least 100 news outlets, said the report. Outside Turkey, the total of 259 journalists in jail around the globe compares to 199 at the same time last year. It is the highest number since the CPJ began keeping detailed records in 1990. Those numbers do not include journalists who have disappeared, or who are in the hands of non-state groups. For example, the freelance British journalist John Cantlie, held by Islamic State, is classified as “missing” or “abducted”. After Turkey, the worst offender in 2016 was China, where 38 journalists were in custody on 1 December. China was the world’s worst jailer of journalists in the previous two years. The report says: “In recent weeks, Beijing has deepened its crackdown on journalists who cover protests and human rights abuses.” Egypt was listed in third place, with 25 journalists incarcerated. Many of them have spent years in jail without facing trial. Eritrea and Ethiopia are fourth and fifth worst jailers of journalists. This year marked the first time since 2008 that Iran was not among the top five worst offenders. The report points out that many of those detained and convicted in a post-election crackdown in 2009 have served their sentences and been released. “Journalists working to gather and share information are performing a public service and their rights are protected under international law. It is shocking therefore that so many governments are violating their international commitments by jailing journalists and suppressing critical speech,” said CPJ’s executive director Joel Simon. “Turkey is at the vanguard of this authoritarian trend. Every day that Turkey’s journalists languish in jail in violation of that country’s own laws, Turkey’s standing in the world is diminished.”",diasaster:0},

{ "title":"The Guardian view on Aung San Suu Kyi and Burma’s future", "content": "Burma’s reforms have been applauded and encouraged by western countries. But whether these reforms will be taken to the point where the rule of law is fully consolidated, and a solidly based democratic state has emerged, very much hangs in the balance. The next few weeks are critical. During that time, probably by the end of February at the latest, the Burmese government is due to give its response to a range of options put before it by a special constitutional committee. This will set the terms under which the country’s next elections will be held in late 2015, but it will also shape Burmese politics for years to come. According to what is decided, Burmese reform will go down as a return to the democratic path abandoned when the military seized power a half-century ago, as a highly unsatisfactory halfway house between military and civilian rule, or, worse, as a fraud in which military dominance will be maintained behind a civilian screen. The role of Aung San Suu Kyi is unavoidably the central issue. She is a politician who could play the part in Burma which Nelson Mandela played in South Africa and which Andrei Sakharov could perhaps have played in Russia had not his death removed him from the scene – figures so widely trusted and respected that all can rally to their leadership. Not many countries with difficult histories are lucky enough to have such a leader in waiting, and yet the Burmese constitution, as it is today, lays down that she cannot stand for president in the coming election because her two children have married foreigners, a provision expressly inserted to keep her out. The all too obvious danger is that the Burmese military, fearful of losing its privileges, hidebound by a narrow view of national security, and feeling it has already achieved its aim of balancing strong Chinese influence by bringing other countries into play, will sideline or discard her. She could be lost to Burma, as her father was before her, and that would be a tragedy, for her and for her country. None of this means that she is without fault or that, if she attained the presidency, everything would immediately be harmonious and wonderful. Yet she represents Burma’s best chance of a good future. It is now inane for outsiders to say the regime has made some steps in the right direction. The government has had more than enough credit for those limited changes and needs to be pressed to go much, much further. If it maintains the ban, that should be a red line for western countries, and for other states which may have less pronounced views on democracy but nevertheless have an interest in Burma’s stability. But international pressure on Burma seems to have slackened rather than increased. It is true there have been some good things done, the release of political prisoners, the lifting of the bar on public assemblies, and the reappearance of independent newspapers among them. Yet this sits alongside a system in which soldiers, by law, have 25% of the seats in parliament, where they vote as a bloc and have a virtual veto on constitutional amendments, while key ministries are reserved for serving officers. In no other country in the world is military control entrenched in such a way. It is profoundly undemocratic and it is not popular in Burma, where five million people have signed a petition calling for it to be ended. It is also true that Burma’s economy, helped by the partial lifting of sanctions and an inflow of foreign investment, is doing a lot better. Many ordinary Burmese are leading better lives, and many already rich Burmese, most of them with military connections, are getting richer. That, in a sense, is the problem. The Burmese regime has been rewarded for reform before it has delivered it, or, at least, before it has delivered it in full measure. Western sanctions have been lifted or softened. Western leaders, notably Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama – who was most recently in Burma in October for a summit meeting of the United States and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations – have begun to pay regular, if still wary, court. But, as Aung San Suu Kyi said in a recent interview, western countries are acting as if reform were an accomplished fact rather than very much still unfinished business. With so little time left, that should now change.",diasaster:0},

A report this year showed that 60% of the world’s countries were experiencing a serious decline in religious freedom, where minorities endure violence and discrimination. The way of judging any civilisation is how it treats its minorities. We should heed the great political philosopher Karl Popper, who advocated “in the name of tolerance, the right not to tolerate the intolerant”. Popper explained: “We should claim that any movement preaching intolerance places itself outside the law, and we should consider incitement to intolerance and persecution as criminal, in the same way as we should consider incitement to murder, or to kidnapping, or to the revival of the slave trade, as criminal.” Zaki Cooper London • The 2003 Iraq invasion was indeed a disaster for Christians in the Middle East. Syria under Assad was, according to William Dalrymple’s From the Holy Mountain (1997), the safest place for Christians to practise their religion. This safety has virtually disappeared. On a happier note, in Highgate, a predominantly Muslim area in Birmingham, at least 30 Muslims attended the midnight mass service in St Alban’s church and took part in wishing us a merry Christmas, some going up to the altar for a blessing. I pray that this fine gesture will become widespread. David Craig Bromsgrove, Worcestershire • If Herod, King of Judea, sent his soldiers to murder baby Jesus, then the Romans did not rule Judea and could not have been “threatened by Christmas” at the time (Loose canon, 27 December). The idea that later on a preacher too insignificant to come to the attention of a single Roman historian, who exhorted his followers to “render unto Caesar what is Caesar’s”, represented such a “threat to the stability of the state that the Romans executed him” is hardly any less absurd. Even the gospels are clear that Pilate, a Roman prefect who otherwise relentlessly persecuted the Jews, found no grounds for executing Jesus (John 18:38). “The Chinese” may well feel threatened by the festival the University in Xi’an described as “western kitsch” (Report, theguardian.com, 25 December) – but “Christmas” was no threat to the Romans. Peter McKenna Liverpool • Giles Fraser says: “Christianity is an aggressive religion that has long historical form in picking fights and toppling dictatorships”. Which ones, Giles? David Rainbird Wallasey, Wirral • Neither theologians, artists nor Christians seem to appreciate that there are various sorts of stable. Botticelli’s Mystic Nativity (Jesus was not born in a stable but in a family home, theologian says, 24 December) shows a stable as westerners think of it – a free-standing, roofed, rectangular structure above ground – whereas the spot claimed to be Jesus’s birthplace beneath the Church of the Nativity, Bethlehem, is in a scoop into solid limestone at the base of a cave. This exists within a subterranean complex of caves and passages, now known from archaeological excavation to extend east and southeast of the church. This was an area of civil occupation before the first church was built; and some of the “family homes” that stood there would have had rock-cut cellars that could have had many uses, including being a stable. The Rev Ian Paul is therefore drawing a false dichotomy in claiming that, because Jesus was born in a “family home”, he could not have been born in a stable. Pastoralists still struggling to survive in the hills south of Hebron live in traditional family homes carved out of rock, with accommodation characteristically consisting of a living area with open hearth, surrounded by sleeping quarters and, at the rear, storage cells and a cave-stable. The best one I saw had a hole in the roof at ground level, through which animal feed was dropped. Livestock are overwintered in such stables. Peter Fowler London • It is futile to try to locate the place (and time) of Jesus’s birth by referring to Biblical texts. It is quite clear that the New Testament writers either knew nothing about the circumstances of Jesus’ birth or thought they were irrelevant. Neither the earliest writers, Saint Paul and Saint Mark, nor Saint John mention them at all. Saint Matthew and Saint Luke used considerable and very different “poetic licence” in their efforts to have Jesus born in Bethlehem (City of David) in the face of the knowledge that he grew up in Nazareth. It is also evident that Luke’s original gospel began at what is now chapter three, and that he added the birth and infancy narratives of chapters one and two subsequently; perhaps after coming across Matthew’s gospel. The circumstances of his birth are irrelevant to Jesus’s good news. Rev Dr Jeyan Anketell Modern Church, Lichfield, Staffordshire",diasaster:0},

Weah won the Montserrado County seat that includes the capital, Monrovia, with 78% of the vote, defeating Robert Sirleaf, the son of President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, Liberia’s national elections commission said late on Saturday. Weah, leader of Liberia’s largest opposition party, the Congress for Democratic Change, lost the 2005 presidential election to Sirleaf and was unsuccessful again in 2011 when he was a vice-presidential candidate. He is expected to stand again in 2017. Weah won Fifa’s world player of the year in 1995. Liberia’s efforts to recover from a long civil war that ended in 2003 and reestablish democracy have been hampered this year by an Ebola epidemic that has killed more than 3,300 people in the country and more than 7,500 people in west Africa. “Results from all 4,701 polling places in the country have already been counted and tallied. The recorded voter turnout for the election is 479,936, which represents 25.2%of the total number of registered voters,” the election commission chairman, Jerome Korkoya, said in a statement following the elections to the senate – the upper house of the legislature. Other senate winners included Jewel Howard-Taylor, the former wife of ex-president Charles Taylor, who was convicted by the international criminal court in 2012 on charges including war crimes and crimes against humanity. Jewel Taylor retained her seat in Bong County, north-central Liberia.

Frost had played peculiar tricks with its colours, highlighting the dark markings on its head, suppressing the muted shades on its body. Just as it had cast a glaze over the meadow, the frost seemed to have bleached out the grass-green tones that gave the bird its name. The green woodpecker pecked at the frozen soil, a peck-and-pause routine that lasted for some minutes. An ant-licker in summer, what was it finding now? In the bright white landscape of fields and lakes, strong colours and sudden movements sang out. Binoculars swung towards a glowing orb on the far side of the big lake. It was as if a zebra-crossing beacon had parked in the reeds. The image resolved into a beach ball of lurid yellow, lodged among the stems. At once, a shape popped up from the water much closer to. I caught sight of a grebe, slim and angular, great but not crested, but then it was under again. The ripples from its dive had barely smoothed out when a cluster of bubbles appeared at the surface five metres or so to the left. Five metres more and another cloud of froth came up. I was playing Guess the Grebe, anticipating exactly where the next eruption of air would happen. I guessed right just once, before the swimming bird doubled back and surfaced at the spot where it had dived. Here was a hunter with no frills attached. The softening springtime orangey-brown ruff of feathers around its neck and dainty little ear tufts were no more. Stripped bare in winter of its delicate finery, the grebe took on a different character. This was a creature of a monochrome world, drawn in charcoal, its lighter patches smudged, dark areas fuzzy.

{ "title":"Met police taking time off work with stress-related illnesses", "content": "The number of days taken off work by Met police officers owing to stress-related illness has increased by 43% over the last five years, according to figures released by the London force. The number of resignations has also increased dramatically from 289 officers in 2009-10 to 506 in 2013-14, although the figures do not record the reasons for quitting. John Tully, chairman of the Metropolitan Police Federation (MPF), which represents rank and file officers, said the figures reflected the “human cost” of government cuts and increased workloads. The data showed “a workforce on their knees whilst upholding the finest traditions of the Metropolitan police and maintaining a professional service to the public”, he said. The Met figures, released to the Guardian under the Freedom of Information Act, show that London police took a total of 24,065 days off work owing to stress-related conditions (including post-traumatic stress disorder) in 2013-14, amounting to 44 days for each officer taking leave. That compares with 16,781 days in 2009-10. The equivalent figure in 2012-13 was higher at 25,918 days, possibly because of the demands placed on the Met by the London Olympics. The number of officers needing to take stress-related leave went up from 413 to 545 between 2009-10 and 2013-14. That is close to 2% of the force. The MPF said the figures were likely to just be “the tip of the iceberg” as many officers hid their fatigue and stress. However, Scotland Yard said it had a number of initiatives to help combat stress, including an in-house counselling service, fast-track interventions and programmes to help staff identify signs of stress. A spokesperson for the Metropolitan Police Service said: “Despite the physically and mentally demanding nature of police work, absenteeism rates in the MPS are low, lower than most public sector organisations and other police services. “We continually strive to improve through preventative training and support. Getting our officers back out on the front line as soon as they are ready is a priority.” But Tully said: “The total war on crime, in the face of reducing budgets and unprecedented organisational change programmes, is complicit in the ever-increasing workload of individual officers. “There are instances of some detectives carrying over 20 live crime investigations; on top of those pending a court hearing, as well as the continuing pressure of new prisoners in detention waiting to be dealt with every new shift.” Tully also blamed “morale-sapping” changes to pay and terms of conditions. He said that austerity measures imposed on the Met were delayed because of the Olympics, but that the force was “now feeling the pain”. The most affected by stress-related absences was the Met’s Westminster headquarters, which had a total of 34 officers taking 1,549 days off owing to stress in 2013-14. Counter-terrorism command had 15 officers take leave because of stress, each taking an average of 64 days off. The policing minister, Mike Penning , said: “Officers do a vital job and policing remains an attractive and well-paid career, with a pension that is among the best available. “According to national data, there have been decreases in the number of hours lost to short-, medium- and long-term sickness over the last two years. The percentage of officers absent due to long-term sickness also fell over the same period. “Police reform is working and crime is down a fifth since the last election. We have made it easier for the police to do their job by cutting red tape, scrapping unnecessary targets, and giving them the discretion to use their professional judgment.”",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Michel Roux Jr apologises for paying chefs less than minimum wage", "content": "Former BBC1 MasterChef host and Michelin-starred, Le Gavroche restaurant owner Michel Roux Jr has spoken out for the first time since it was revealed he was paying chefs below the minimum wage, saying: “I am embarrassed and I am sorry.” The statement follows the Guardian’s report last month that Roux was paying some of his Mayfair restaurant staff rates as low as £5.50 an hour when the legal minimum is £7.20. Chefs preparing a menu including starters costing as much as £62.80 for the lobster mousse with caviar and champagne sauce, were found to be working routinely 62- to 68-hour weeks for about £375 before tax. They should have been paid £490 for a 68-hour week. “The buck stops with me and I take responsibility for ballsing up on this particular front,” Roux said in an interview with trade publication The Caterer. “I am embarrassed and I am sorry, but in no way was it done intentionally.” Chefs had told the Guardian they would be expected to start work at about 8.30am most days and work through till about 11.30pm with only half to one hour off following lunch and about 15 minutes to eat meals in the staff canteen. But Roux, who said he was “very hands on” and “I like to be in control of everything”, claimed he had not noticed their long hours. Michel Roux Jr's failure to pay chefs minimum wage 'not acceptable' Read more “We are not above the law and I am not in any way looking for excuses but there were some mitigating circumstances,” he said. “As chefs you get into that routine of working these hours and getting used to it, coming in at 8am instead of 9am, and I am to blame. I should have seen but I didn’t. It wasn’t flagged up directly to me. Because … I am very hands on… maybe the managers and head chefs didn’t come to report to me because they thought I knew. It is my fault.” Roux said he had started locking the restaurant door in the morning to prevent chefs starting early and working longer hours. He said that when he previously did this, chefs tried to climb through the kitchen window or bribe the kitchen porter with beer to let them in. “You may think it is funny, but it is part of the issue,” Roux said. From March, he is planning to reduce the maximum working hours to 50 a week, partly by closing for Tuesday lunch in addition to the current closures all day Sunday, Monday, and Saturday lunch. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Roux claimed that working at famous restaurants such as his, offers ‘intangible’ benefits. Photograph: Rex/Shutterstock But Roux also stressed the “intangible” benefits of working at his restaurant, in comments that may concern chefs who fear some famous restaurants have used their reputations as valuable training grounds to extract long hours for low pay. “The work conditions are unbelievable and the benefits of working at Le Gavroche and for the Roux family are incredible,” Roux said. “But they are intangible. You can’t put a worth on it. You can’t put it on the payslip. ” Since the Guardian exposed the underpayment, which can result in a fine from HM Revenue and Customs, Roux has made an assessment of his chefs’ pay and “will be paying everybody who is owed back pay”, a spokeswoman for the restaurant said. The payouts will relate to last year, she said, and applied to a few staff “on a case by case basis”. It is likely that some payouts will run into thousands of pounds. The restaurant also said Roux had increased pay for some staff to ensure they were paid at least the legal minimum and that their salaries would remain in place when hours were reduced next year. One chef welcomed Roux’s comments but questioned why he was closing the restaurant for longer. “It is good that he is taking action on chefs being underpaid, but would it not be better to pay the extra money to take us up to minimum wage rather than cutting hours,” they said. “We would come in earlier if we could, as he says. We enjoy being chefs and the hours are not a problem. He seems to be trying to paint a picture of us in which we’re complaining about working hard, and that isn’t fair.” Roux remarked in the Caterer interview that when he was training in Paris in 1976 he slept on his grandmother’s couch and “had to wash in the kitchen sink and boil a kettle”. “Did I look at my payslip? Not once,” he said. Roux also questioned the way the government has structured the minimum wage, with increasing rates for different age brackets, topping out at £7.20 an hour for people aged 25 and over. “If someone comes here and is over the age of 24, has got zero experience … [and] they come knocking on my door and say they want a change of career and would love to work here; that person, because he or she is over the age of 24, needs to be paid at a higher rate,” Roux said. “Is it fair that person should get a higher rate than a college leaver that has got a qualification, is 20 for example, and OK has got limited experience, but has got a qualification? It doesn’t seem very fair to me, but that is one thing we are facing in our industry.”",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Teenager who hacked TalkTalk website given rehabilitation order", "content": "A 17-year-old who admitted hacking offences linked to the TalkTalk data breach has been given a 12-month youth rehabilitation order and had his smartphone and computer hard drive confiscated. The teenager, who cannot be named for legal reasons, found a vulnerability in the website using legitimate software and shared details of this online, an earlier hearing at Norwich youth court was told. While he did not exploit the information for gain, the TalkTalk website was targeted more than 14,000 times after the boy exposed the vulnerability. He told magistrates: “I was just showing off to my mates,” as he admitted seven hacking offences. Sentencing him on Tuesday over the multimillion-pound data breach in October 2015, the chairman of the bench, Jean Bonnick, said: “Your IT skills will always be there – just use them legally in the future.” Two of the charges related to the TalkTalk hack, but the boy admitted targeting other websites including Manchester University, Cambridge University and that of Merit Badges, a small family company which supplies martial arts badges. Telecoms giant TalkTalk fell victim to what it described as a “significant and sustained” cyber-attack on its website on 21 October 2015; the firm said the fallout had cost it £42m. After the hearing, Laura Tams of the Crown Prosecution Service’s organised crime division said: “This case involved the deliberate exposure of a security issue on the TalkTalk website which is used by thousands of people every day. “Through analysis of online chats and other digital footprints, prosecutors were able to demonstrate exactly how the defendant found this weakness and shared the details online.” Chris Brown, mitigating, said the 12-month order would help rehabilitate the youth, who was likely to be back in education next year. He said its purpose was to “draw him from the lonely confines of a bedroom and that lonely world of computing to a family where his knowledge and skills could be put to good use and to project that out to the wider world”. He added: “His family have been supportive and encouraging him to look at new options. There are many, many positives about this young man that lay behind the case.” He said the teenager was from a supportive family but the “one place you can’t be so protective these days is online”. The teenager, who sat with his mother in court, spoke only to confirm that he understood the proceedings. Bonnick told him he must complete 24 hours of activities as part of the 12-month youth rehabilitation order. His iPhone and a computer hard drive were forfeited to police, and he was ordered to pay £85 court costs and a £15 victim surcharge. An application to lift reporting restrictions on the case and identify the teenager was refused. Bonnick said: “It’s the bench’s view that this application was not made in a timely fashion.” Opposing the application to name the teenager, Brown said “the only grounds that could apply in this situation” were if it were in the public interest to do so. He noted the application’s case that naming the youth would serve as a deterrent to others committing similar hacking offences. But he said: “There has been significant reporting of the full extent of what went on. I can’t see how the addition of a name makes any difference to the deterrent element.” He added that naming the teenager could harm his rehabilitation. “Part of the work that’s ongoing is to draw him out of his bedroom and into the family and properly into the public arena, to someone who doesn’t hide behind a computer for nefarious purposes,” he said. “He has already committed an offence that has changed his life within his family, his home, his future prospects. I would ask you don’t expose that to the world for him to continue to bear that burden through his young life. “The public interest is very adequately served by knowing the facts of this case.”",diasaster:0},

Michael Steven Sandford, who has autism, tried to get the weapon at a Las Vegas casino where Trump was addressing supporters during the presidential campaign. He allegedly told officers after his arrest that he planned to shoot Trump. 'They said my son intended to assassinate Donald Trump. And my world just stopped' Read more Sandford, of Dorking, Surrey, pleaded guilty in September to charges of being an illegal alien in possession of a firearm and disrupting an official function. He could have faced up to 20 years in prison if he had been convicted at trial of both charges. Judge James Mahan told him: “You have a medical problem. You should not be ashamed or embarrassed about it. You need medication. “You’re not a hardened criminal. You’re not evil or a sociopath like a lot of people we have. I don’t think you wanted to kill anybody. This was just some crazy stunt that your mind told you to do.” A tearful Sandford told the court: “I know saying sorry is not enough. I really do feel awful about what I did. I wish there was some way to make things better. I have cost taxpayers so much money. I feel terrible.” Addressing the judge, he added: “I’m really sorry to you and the court for taking up so much time.” As he has already been in custody since being arrested, he is not expected to have to spend a further 12 months behind bars. Sandford did not get hold of the gun before he was arrested, and no shots were fired. Court documents say that Sandford told a federal agent that he drove from California to Las Vegas with a plan to kill Trump. His UK lawyer, Saimo Chahal, QC, of Bindmans, had argued that Sandford was delusional at the time. The court papers also stated that Sandford had gone to a gun range in Las Vegas to learn how to fire a gun, which he had not done before. Sandford told police he had been in the US for 18 months before the incident. He was unemployed, living out of his car and in the US illegally. As well as autism, he also has obsessive compulsive disorder, severe depression, seizures, cardiac issues and Crohn’s disease, according to his family. His mother Lynne Sandford, who travelled to the US for the sentencing with her mother Christine and four-year-old daughter Jessica, had appealed to the judge to allow her son to serve his sentence in the UK so he could get the right psychiatric help. The family has launched a crowdfunding campaign to cover the legal costs relating to their bid to bring Sandford back to the UK to serve his sentence. “Michael’s actions were completely out of character. He is an extremely vulnerable young man and we believe that he needs to return to the UK in order to serve his sentence,” his mother wrote. Until sentencing, Lynne Sandford had only seen her son once since he was arrested. “During my visit to Las Vegas, I learned that Michael had been on suicide watch several times following numerous mental breakdowns,” she wrote. “‘Suicide watch’ in the US involves being kept in isolation 24/7 for up to a week at a time. Other prisoners are allowed books, but these are taken away from Michael while he is in isolation. Michael isn’t even allowed toilet paper while he is in isolation.”",diasaster:0},

This buzzard is a harlequin of browns, greys and whites, and it has been suggested that because of this plumage, colour is relatively unimportant to these predators.

No hiding place for a stranded squab Read more Perhaps because I like these colours in the landscape, I think they’re more important to the buzzard; it sees them differently, far more intensely than I do. Its retinas have cones with five pigments (we have three), and this allows it to see far more variation in colour than I can. Without my specs all this would look like muddy Impressionism, so that may be the difference between our colour visions. The buzzard scans the landscape for traces of movement that betray the presence of rabbits, voles or mice. Its eyes are more forward facing than most birds’ and, like humans, it has binocular vision. But it can also create a telephoto optical system that detects and follows movement that would seem a blur to us. Although this bird is searching for small mammals and birds, if hungry it may go over to the open fields to walk about picking worms and other invertebrates from the bare earth.

{ "title":"UK 4G coverage worse than in Romania and Peru, watchdog finds", "content": "Britain’s 4G mobile phone coverage is worse than that in Albania, Panama, Peru and Romania, with users able to connect barely half the time, a government infrastructure watchdog has found. In a major new report, the National Infrastructure Commission said the UK is being held back by poor mobile phone connectivity, as it called for an end to “digital deserts” in places that should have adequate signals such as rail routes, roads and city centres. Countries including the US and Japan already have data volumes four to five higher than the UK, the report found. The commission, chaired by Andrew Adonis, the crossbench peer and former Labour minister, said the government must now ensure that the next generation of 5G spectrum does not have the failures that dog 4G coverage. “Britain is 54th in the world for 4G coverage, and the typical user can only access 4G barely half the time,” Adonis said. “Our 4G network is worse than Romania and Albania, Panama and Peru. Our roads and railways can feel like digital deserts and even our city centres are plagued by not spots where connectivity is impossible. “That isn’t just frustrating, it is increasingly holding British business back as more and more of our economy requires a connected workforce.” In a list of recommendations, it argued there should be a new dedicated cabinet minister in charge of the UK’s digital future, ensuring mobile connectivity is competitive with the rest of the world. On top of that, it called for ministers and Ofcom, the media regulator, to work together to ensure a set of standards known as a universal service obligation no later than 2025. The crucial priorities for coverage are key rail routes, major roads such as motorways and all towns and cities, Adonis said. “5G is the future – ultra-fast and ultra-reliable, it has the potential to change our lives and our economy in ways we cannot even imagine today. But the UK is currently languishing in the digital slow lane,” he added. “5G offers us a chance to start again and get ahead. If government acts now we can ensure our major transport networks and urban centres are 5G ready in time to give British industry every chance to lead the world in exploiting its applications. “But none of this will matter unless we bring our mobile network up to speed. The existing system does not provide the level of coverage we will need in our connected future. We need a new universal service obligation which ensures that the mobile essentials – like text, talk and data – are available to us wherever we need them.” Grant Shapps, the former Tory chairman who now leads the British Infrastructure Group of MPs, said the report should be a wakeup call for the government, as he accused them of being too willing to listen to the excuses of mobile phone operators about poor signal. “This confirms what we have been saying for a long time. Over the years, ministers have been far too easy on the glib promises given by the telecoms providers and I think that has been combined with ineffective and weak regulation from Ofcom,” Shapps said. “Britain cannot afford to repeat the outcome of the 5G network that we have had with the 4G network and so the British Infrastructure is calling on the prime minister to appoint a cabinet minister to oversee the recommendations of this report and make sure this person is accountable for delivering 5G throughout the UK. UK 4G coverage is worse than in Peru. We need a minister for the internet | Charles Arthur Read more “Unfortunately there has been a very long history of believing what the telecoms companies say rather than questioning it. The fact the report was commissioned is a good thing but Britain should be all about infrastructure in this post-Brexit world and here is a real wake-up call to make sure it actually happens this time.” The National Infrastructure Commission was established last year by George Osborne, the then chancellor, to advise the government on critical challenges related to the UK’s networks such as transport, telecommunications, energy and utilities. 5G networks are not expected to become available until 2020 but Ofcom has already begun preparations for auctioning off the spectrum. The round of 4G auctions raised less than Osborne had hoped for in 2012 and much of the UK is still plagued with “not spots” of poor signal. In a recent report backed by 90 MPs from all parties, the British Infrastructure Group proposed an amendment to the government’s digital economy bill to allow Ofcom to fine mobile operators that did not meet the targets of a 2014 agreement. That deal gave the four large network operators (MNOs) another chance to fix mobile “not spots” after they said they would pump £5bn into improving coverage across the UK by December 2017 in return for the government not pursuing a system of national roaming. BIG said it found little evidence to suggest that the mobile sector would meet the targets of this agreement to provide coverage to 90% of the UK’s geographic area, and called for a progress update to be published by the end of 2016.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"UN accused of 'gross failure' over alleged sexual abuse by French troops", "content": "The United Nations’ failure to respond to allegations that French peacekeepers sexually abused children in Central African Republic amounted to “gross institutional failure” and allowed assaults to continue, according to an independent panel’s damning report released on Thursday. The study, commissioned by the UN, found that children as young as nine were encouraged to take part in oral sex in exchange for food or money in the middle of a war zone. The alleged perpetrators were mainly French soldiers from a unit known as the Sangaris force which was operating under authorisation of the security council but not under UN command. UN aid worker suspended for leaking report on child abuse by French troops Read more The inquiry report, entitled Taking Action on Sexual Exploitation and Abuse by Peacekeepers, exonerated Anders Kompass, the director of field operations for the UN’s office of the high commissioner for human rights – the whistleblower who first disclosed the abuse. He had been suspended for disclosing an internal report on abuse to French prosecutors. Initial complaints in early 2014, the report said, were “passed from desk to desk, inbox to inbox, across multiple UN offices, with no one willing to take responsibility”. Even when the French government became aware of the allegations and sought the cooperation of UN staff, its requests were met with resistance and “became bogged down in formalities”. UN staff, it is said, became overly concerned with whether the allegations had been improperly leaked to French authorities and focused on protocols rather than action. Among those said to have looked the other way were the UN children’s agency, Unicef, as well as human rights officials. The UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, expressed “profound regret that these children were betrayed by the very people sent to protect them”. He said he accepted the panel’s broad findings. The panel, led by the Canadian judge, Marie Deschamps, found that UN staffers failed or hesitated to pass the children’s allegations to more senior officials, sometimes because of political concerns with France. “Not only were there unconscionable delays in providing the children with basic medical care, psychological support, shelter, food, or protection, but no steps were taken to locate the additional child victims ... to determine if they also required protection and care,” the report states. There was a failure to vet peacekeepers sufficiently to screen out those with a history of past abuse. Four French soldiers are being questioned in an investigation into alleged child sexual abuse in CAR. A total of 14 people are said to be under investigation. Referring to Kompass, the report recognised his seniority, extensive experience with field missions and the fact that human rights officials “had not followed up on the allegations despite the need for urgent action”. Kompass, it adds, had received “assurances that the information would be kept confidential and, more importantly, that France would take action to bring the perpetrators to justice ... No adverse finding is made against the director on this issue.” In May, an appeal tribunal had ordered the UN to immediately lift the suspension of Kompass. So far, more than a year and a half after UN officials first heard the children’s allegations of sexual abuse, no one has been arrested, the panel points out. The report tackles one of the most persistent and embarrassing problems for the UN and its member countries. Tens of thousands of peacekeepers serve in some of the world’s most volatile areas. The abuse in CAR’s capital, Bangui, emerged in the middle of a chaotic war. The country had been torn apart by violence between Christians and Muslims. Thousands of frightened people had sought shelter in squalid camps at the airport. The accusations were not made public until the Guardian’s revelations in April. The French government has not explained why the investigation was kept quiet, although the French president, François Hollande, has promised tough punishment for any soldier found guilty. French soldiers interrogated in child sex abuse inquiry Read more The alleged abuse took place as French peacekeeping troops were supposed to be protecting civilians at a centre for displaced people near the airport in Bangui, between December 2013 – when the French military operation began – and June 2014. Similar accusations of abuse have emerged against soldiers from Chad and Equatorial Guinea serving in CAR. In its conclusion the panel said: “The persistence of serious crimes against vulnerable local populations perpetrated by some of the very individuals charged with protecting them puts at risk the sustainability of peacekeeping missions in the longer term. “The UN must take immediate action when it receives reports of sexual violence by peacekeepers to stop the violations and hold the perpetrators accountable ... Above all, UN staff and agencies must end the bureaucratic cycle in which responsibility is fragmented and accountability is passed from one agency to another.” It added: “When peacekeepers exploit the vulnerability of the people they have been sent to protect, it is a fundamental betrayal of trust.”",diasaster:0},

A merlin has just swerved its way around and between their massive bodies in pursuit of prey that has tried to confuse it by dodging among the cattle. But the ruse fails, and both birds emerge to engage in aerial battle silhouetted against the blank grey sky. Dung roaming Read more A meadow pipit in a wild flutter of desperate wings is jinking and climbing and jinking again, trying manoeuvre after frantic manoeuvre to evade a pursuer that follows every move. Time after time, it narrowly evades the talons that seek to snatch it from the air. Then, strangely, for the merlin is far faster in straight line flight, the pipit breaks away and flees, only to make an immediate U-turn and head back through the cattle. There is one more brief glimpse of the hunt low above the field, but it is soon lost to sight as the land slopes away. Yet perhaps eventually the chase was successful, or the merlin found less agile quarry, for not long afterwards it re-appears, flying more slowly and maybe, just maybe – for both distance and fading light make it hard to be sure – clutching something in its talons. And it’s at this moment that the cattle suddenly come to full alert, heads lifting in unison at the sound of their owner’s vehicle approaching. As it turns into the lane they are galvanised into action, breaking into an ungainly lumbering canter as they follow it down to the gate in the field corner, where they jostle eagerly as they await the treat of the supplementary feed that is about to be delivered.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Lights, camera, earthquake!", "content": "Unusual lighting is often reported in the days leading up to an earthquake. It may look like normal lightning striking upwards, or take the form of glowing spheres like ball lightning. Other earthquake lights resemble the electrical glow of St Elmo’s Fire or an aurora. Some researchers believe that this activity may help in predicting earthquakes. The lights are elusive, and were not photographed until a Japanese quake in 1968. The exact cause is still the subject of furious academic debate. We do know though that it is electrical and may be visible as lightning and other effects. A recent study by the Taiwanese National University showed that lightning generally became more common in the weeks preceding an earthquake. Some researchers are focusing on the total amount of electrons, or total electron count (TEC), in Earth’s ionosphere, which changes with electrical activity. TEC is easy to monitor because it affects GPS signals, and there is plenty of data on how it varies over time. A study by a team at Chapman University in California found a sudden rise in TEC before the Nepal quakes this year. However, this does not mean that predicting quakes will be simple. A paper from a team at the National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology in L’Aquila, Italy, suggests that the correlation between TEC and earthquakes is not very strong. The researchers point out that atmospheric anomalies have never been used to predict an earthquake, and that a link has only been suggested with hindsight.",diasaster:1},

Thea Rogers, a close associate of Osborne, received the biggest rise among all the political special advisers across government, an increase of 42% since the figures were released last November, giving her £98,000. She is now his chief of staff. A former BBC producer who once worked with the corporation’s former political editor Nick Robinson, she is said to have been responsible for Osborne’s Caesar-style haircut and for placing him on the 5:2 diet. A year ago, she acted as a special adviser, handling his image and events. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Thea Rogers, a close associate of Osborne, has received the biggest pay increase of 42%. Photograph: Andrew Parsons/Rex/Shutterstock A year ago Osborne employed three special advisers and had four more political appointees sitting on his council of advisers. Since then, advisers hired by the chancellor include James Chapman, the Daily Mail’s political editor until the election, who is now paid £125,000; and Sue Beeby, who previously worked for Jeremy Hunt and is being paid £73,000 to be part of the Treasury team. Osborne has three other people employed in his office whose pay levels are not registered. Another special adviser to Osborne, Eleanor Wolfson, is currently on maternity leave, a footnote adds. The footnote to the data also shows that the chancellor has taken on three other politically employed advisers who sit on the council of economic advisers – Richard Davies, who is paid £98,000; Neil O’Brien, who is paid £93,450; and Jennifer Donne, whose pay is not registered.

Photograph: Robin Bell/ANL/Rex Shutterstock The disclosure comes in data that shows the bill for special advisers across the government rose to £9.2m in 2014-15, up from £8.4m the previous financial year. The report was one of a deluge released by the government on subjects ranging from the bedroom tax to fracking on the last day of Commons business before Christmas. Ministers released more 424 documents online by 5pm on Thursday, including 36 written ministerial statements on subjects of national importance. Amongst the information was a report on the bedroom tax, described by Labour as “damning”, that revealed three-quarters of those affected were cutting back on food, and a local government spending settlement that involves billions of pounds in cuts and potential council tax rises. Labour’s deputy leader, Tom Watson, said: “David Cameron can’t bury the fact that he’s broken a direct promise he made to reduce the cost of politics and curb the number of special advisers in government.” In July, the chancellor told thousands of teachers, nurses, police, firefighters and civil servants that they would face another four years of having pay rises limited to 1% a year, effectively a freeze, as part of planned savings worth £17bn. Many more jobs are also set to be lost across the public sector. The increase in money spent on special advisers is particularly embarrassing for David Cameron because of previous pledges to cut the cost of government and the number of special advisers. The data shows that Cameron has 32 advisers – six more than in November last year. Twenty-three are paid more than £63,000 a year. Topping the list are his head of communications, Craig Oliver, and chief of staff, Ed Llewellyn, who both earn £140,000. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Craig Oliver, head of communications, earns £140,000 annually. Photograph: Toby Melville/Reuters A string of special advisers across all government departments have had above-inflation pay increases over the last year. They include Ameet Gill, an adviser to Cameron, who is now being paid £98,000 – an increase of 22%; Nick Seddon, another Cameron adviser, who is being paid £88,000 – an increase of 12%; and Graham Hook, an adviser to the defence secretary, Michael Fallon, who is paid £70,000 – an increase of 7.7%. The number of “spads” in the highest pay grade of PB4 has jumped from four to 10. The number in the next highest paygrade, PB3, has grown from 15 to 26. Last November the government announced that the cost of its special advisers had passed £8m – a rise of more than £1m over a 12-month period. At the beginning of this year there were just over 100 spads. During the last months of the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition, a total of 26 special advisers worked for Cameron in Downing Street, with 20 working for the former Lib Dem leader and deputy prime minister, Nick Clegg. Although the number of advisers necessary for the two-party coalition was expected to fall after the Conservatives’ return to government as a majority single party, there had been no financial information given out until now. Under Gordon Brown in 2009-10, the cost of special advisers was said to be £6.8m, with 71 on the government payroll. A Whitehall source said: “Osborne may have 10 Spads, but that is still one less than Gordon had in the Treasury.” A Downing Street spokesman said he was not aware of any plans to reduce the number of special advisers. “Special advisers provide an important role and it is important that they are there,” the spokesman said. “By providing political advice to ministers, they allow the important distinction to remain between impartial civil servants and special advisers who provide political advice.” Asked whether Cameron was happy that his government employed more than 25% more special advisers than Gordon Brown’s administration, the spokesman would say only that the number and overall cost of special advisers was lower than in the last year of the coalition government.

{ "title":"Cost of childcare cancels out pay for one in 10 working families", "content": "Thousands of parents are in effect working for zero pay, such is the high cost of childcare services in the UK, new research has revealed. One in 10 working families with young children has an earner who brings home nothing after commuting, childcare and other work-associated expenses, according to a biannual report into family finances by the insurer Aviva. The study also shows that one in four families includes one parent who brings home less than £100 a month after costs, while 4% of women surveyed said they were actually paying to work because their costs were greater than the income they bring in. “Aviva’s findings paint a picture of a nation of parents struggling to keep their heads, and careers, above water in the face of rising childcare costs,” said Louise Colley, director of Aviva’s protection insurance operation. “It is vital that the government and employers understand the circumstances and needs of these parents.” The findings coincide with a report by employment consultancy The Jobs Economist that highlights the squeeze on some family incomes. It says the overall outlook for Britain’s jobs market in 2015 is the rosiest since 2007, but inequality in pay will rise as many people remain desperate for work. UK workers will finally see the beginning of a sustained rise in real wages after six years of falls, the study adds, with average weekly pay growth expected to rise to 2.5%, while inflation is forecast to be just 1.2% by the end of 2015. The consultancy said, however, that the clear workforce divide that has emerged in the jobs market would widen, with many prepared to work for low pay or on zero-hours contracts. “Not all workers will notice a marked improvement in their lot,” said John Philpott, director of The Jobs Economist:. “In a labour market still oversupplied with people desperate for whatever work is on offer, employers unable or unwilling to improve working conditions will continue to have no difficulty in hiring staff into minimum wage jobs or on zero-hours contracts without any fringe benefits. “This will serve to further widen what has become a clear structural ‘workforce divide’ within the UK’s ultra-flexible and lightly regulated labour market.” The Aviva report into childcare costs surveyed 2,000 families with children up to five years old and found the median amount left over from the lower earner’s salary is just £243 a month among those who paid for childcare. There are 4.8 million children in the UK aged five or under, according to the Office for National Statistics, and 43% of those surveyed with children in that group said they use childcare to enable them to go out to work. Of those, 84% said they pay for at least some of their childcare. There are an estimated 1.4 million zero-hours contracts in the UK, where staff are hired without being guaranteed a minimum number of hours. Workers on such contracts are paid less and have fewer rights than permanent employees, the TUC has said, resulting in a two-tier workforce in Britain. Employment will grow solidly in 2015, according to The Jobs Economist, but less quickly than 2014 as slower economic growth and faster productivity growth curb the rate of job creation.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Wilfred Owen’s Shrewsbury home granted Grade II listing", "content": "An Edwardian redbrick semi-detached house on the outskirts of Shrewsbury is being honoured on Monday with a Grade II listing, not for its modest architectural qualities but for the man who spent his last two days of leave there in 1918, before returning to France and death in the trenches. Wilfred Owen, one of the most famous of the first world war poets, was killed in action on 4 November, just days before the Armistice. It was at the house, 69 Monkmoor Road, that his parents learned of his death as the bells of Shrewsbury abbey were ringing to hail the end of the war. He was already writing poetry when his family moved to the newly built house in 1910, when he was 17. The house has remained remarkably unchanged, including the bedroom where Owen set up his writing desk. Roger Bowdler, director of designation at English Heritage, said: “The house is little altered, and he would still feel at home in his attic bedroom. It was his last real home and is a tangible link to one of one of our greatest war poets.” Most of his best known poems were published in a single volume two years after his death and edited by his friend and mentor Siegfried Sassoon. They included poems which became some of the most famous memorials to the war, including Anthem for Doomed Youth, and Dulce et Decorum Est, with its savage description of a man dying of gas poisoning and the lines: “My friend, you would not tell with such high zest/To children ardent for some desperate glory/The old Lie; Dulce et decorum est/Pro patria mori.” His memorial in the grounds of Shrewsbury Abbey, commissioned for the centenary of his birth in 1993, bears another quotation: “I am the enemy you killed, my friend.” Heritage minister, Ed Vaizey, said the house deserved the listing, as Owen’s last home before his untimely death. “Wilfred Owen was one of the most profound and distinct voices of the first world war. His bleak and candid accounts of the horrors of war have shaped our understanding of life on the western front.” • This article was amended on 30 December 2014.

{ "title":"Connie Hedegaard: credibility of UN climate process hangs on Paris talks", "content": "Climate change talks next year will be make or break for international efforts to curb global warming, with the credibility of the UN-backed process at stake, the outgoing EU climate chief, Connie Hedegaard, has warned. World leaders are expected to sign an agreement to limit greenhouse gas emissions from 2020 onwards at a Paris conference in December 2015. It could be pivotal in climate negotiations, if China, the US and Europe agree to hold global warming within what scientists say are safe limits. But the risks are great, according to Hedegaard, who recently left the post of European commissioner for climate action and hosted the Copenhagen climate talks in 2009. “Say Paris could not deliver,” she said to the Guardian. “Who would believe the UN process would have credibility after that? That is what [we need] to make leaders understand – it’s now.” At preparatory talks earlier this month in Peru, a framework was agreed for the coming year. Three of the world’s major economic blocs – Europe, China and the US – came forward with proposals on curbing emissions, but Hedegaard was adamant that these must be strictly scrutinised to ensure that no country shirks its responsibilities. “We need to know who is bringing what [commitments] in order to have time [before] Paris to see how all this adds up? Does it bring us closer to bridging the gap [between the world’s current emissions and the cuts needed to prevent more than 2C of warming], or are we more distant from it? Is it fair, is it not fair? That’s a difficult exercise.” For Paris to succeed,the world’s major economies would need to be ambitious about greenhouse gas emissions, she said. There are reasons to be optimistic. China’s decision in November to set a peak year on its emissions has brightened the prospects for a global agreement. “It is good that China accepts that their emissions [are] of interest to the whole world. I remember when [asking] the Chinese when their emissions would peak destroyed the good atmosphere in a room. I hope it will make India [and others] reconsider their strategy, and I see signs that the new Modi government is doing exactly this.” She also praised the US, which set new post-2020 carbon targets, that were announced jointly by President Barack Obama and China’s Xi Jinping. “In 2009 [at the Copenhagen summit] China and the US played ‘after you, sir’ – none of them really moving. It makes a huge difference that they now move forward hand in hand and that they recognise their huge responsibility [as the world’s biggest emitters and economies],” she said. But Hedegaard, who played the lead role in getting governments to agree to meet in Paris, also had stern warnings. “2030 is a very late peak year for China,” she said. The later the peak year, the higher emissions would be before that. She also questioned the value of the US promise to cut emissions by 26-28%, compared with 2005 levels, by 2025. “It is not certain how the US will deliver the 2025 targets – one year after Paris, Obama will be out of office.” Facebook Twitter Pinterest Hedegaard presided over the Copenhagen summit in 2009, which was attended by leaders including Barack Obama, Wen Jiabao, Gordon Brown and Angela Merkel. Photograph: Attila Kisbenedek/AFP/Getty Images Hedegaard knows how hard it will be to succeed. She presided over the Copenhagen summit, arguably the most important talks in 20 years of climate negotiations, which was attended by leaders from nearly every country on the globe, including Barack Obama, Wen Jiabao, Gordon Brown and Angela Merkel. Copenhagen ended with the most significant agreement on climate change to date – the first time developed and major developing countries had acquiesced to curbing their greenhouse gas emissions: a concord between the US, China, India, Europe and all the major emerging economies had been unthinkable only a few years before. But it was marred by scenes of chaos, with some leaders railing against one another. NGOs also criticised the outcome for falling far short of expectations. If Copenhagen was a “nightmare”, in Hedegaard’s words, two years later she came back with an audacious plan. Without Hedegaard, there would be no Paris conference. The process of forging a post-2020 climate agreement started with her extraordinary single-woman stand at the climate talks in Durban in 2011, where in the face of fierce opposition she pushed through a timetable for new negotiations that would culminate in 2015 with the signing of a global pact to come into force in 2020. She crafted a grand alliance of most of the world’s developing countries, and the tacit support of the developed world. By the end, only China and India refused to countenance the timetable, and the exasperation of those two countries was clear. It was a close-run thing. Even into the final minutes, after 48 hours of non-stop talks, all of the main participants were quietly briefing the Guardian that Hedegaard would cave. If she had done, the world would be without a way of tackling climate change. She did not. China and India backed down and Durban was a watershed. Hedegaard will not be part of the EU negotiating team in Paris – “I was never too keen, too fond of UN conferences” – and although she will be chairing a foundation with 1bn Danish kroner to spend on climate and the economy, it is unlikely to be her only new job. “I left politics as a 29-year-old – I was spokesperson in parliament for the prime minister’s party and I left – people couldn’t understand that. Then I went into journalism and I wrote, then I was head of radio news, then I was a minister, then a European commissioner. I’ve had the experience that yes, you say goodbye to something but always it has also been fantastic what came after,” she said. “I’ve been looking forward so much to a new chapter in my life.”",diasaster:0},

Only two thirds of disabled people have internet access, compared to 88% of the UK population as a whole, and a quarter of disabled adults have never been online. Research published this month also found that nearly three quarters of people with disabilities experience problems accessing many websites. The question is whether the government’s long-awaited digital strategy will address these issues. Yet digital technology can also provide the means for people with disabilities or physical and mental health conditions to lead more independent, fuller lives and participate in activities that would otherwise not be possible. More than a quarter of the entries to this year’s Nominet Trust 100 use technology to promote inclusion. This annual list identifies the most inspiring examples across the globe of technology used for social good, and is published on 14 December. Several entrants focus on using communication to boost inclusion. The Open Voice Factory, for example, is the first open-source software providing communication aids. According to Joe Reddington, one of its co-founders, more than 30,000 people in the UK need a device to help them speak but at £2,000 cannot afford standard aids. “We produce a free web app that can be put on a much cheaper tablet that you might already have at home,” he says. The software – in the final stages of testing – allows family or carers to customise it with personal vocabulary, stories and in-jokes.

EVA Park, developed by the Stroke Association-funded EVA project at City University, London, creates a virtual reality environment that helps people with aphasia to communicate again. Disrupt Disability has also created an open-source platform. This allows wheelchairs to be tailor-made, using an online library of free designs for different components; many elements will be suitable for digital production, including 3D printing. Its founder, Rachael Wallach, who has impaired mobility, explains the thinking behind it: “My wheelchair has over 30 different elements that have been tailored to me,” she says. “But it cost £3,000. In a country like Laos, that’s six times the average annual salary, so it’s just not affordable.” The World Health Organisation estimates that more than 65 million people need a wheelchair, yet 80% – some 52 million – cannot afford a wheelchair or one customised to their needs. Dot Watch, the first braille smartwatch Not all the Nominet Trust 100 entries are designed to make products more affordable. Dot Watch, described as the first braille smartwatch, provides social media, news and messages, and is due to go on sale in the UK next year with a price tag of around £2,500. Pips are bluetooth-enabled, palm-sized buttons attached to walls and furniture. They emit beeps when pressed, to turn walking into a game, thereby helping children with no or partial sight to learn to walk confidently. Another movement entrant, Walk With Path, has developed two shoe products that reduce the risk of falls in vulnerable people. The first, Path Feel, is an insole that helps wearers with sensory deficit on the bottom of their feet, such as people with diabetes or multiple sclerosis, to feel the floor better by enhancing sensory perception of the environment, allowing them more confident movement. The second, Path Finder, is specially designed for Parkinson’s patients who suffer from freezing of gait, where they feel as if their feet suddenly become glued to the floor. A small device is attached to the shoe to prevent this sensation. Both products will be available in 2017. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Walk With Path and Path Finder help people to walk confidently Seven projects that make the top 100 focus on safety.

Perhaps the most unusual entrant is the South West Open Youth Orchestra, the UK’s only disabled-led regional youth orchestra. Its founders, OpenUp Music in Bristol, have developed a range of digital instruments that can be played with any part of the body, including the eyes. “Being part of an orchestra is new to me.

{ "title":"Why is UK inflation rising so quickly? Blame Brexit and the oil price", "content": "Gyrations in the oil market meant it was a stone-cold certainty that inflation would be on the rise in late 2016. This time last year the price of crude was crashing, which put strong downward pressure on the cost of living. The annual inflation rate is the sum of price movements in the latest 12 months, so last year’s price falls are gradually dropping out. As they do, inflation automatically goes up. This trend is, however, is being amplified by two other factors. The first is that oil prices are not just holding steady: as a result of the deal between oil-producing countries to curb production they are going up. A year ago, it was possible to find unleaded petrol at around £1 a litre; this Christmas it will be £1.20 a litre. Inflation hits highest level in more than two years Read more The second factor is the 15% depreciation of the pound since the EU referendum in June. Although sterling has been edging higher for the past month, the lagged effect of its drop during the summer and early autumn is making imports dearer. A pick-up in producer price inflation – the cost of goods leaving factory gates – is early evidence of this effect. At 1.2%, inflation remains below the government’s 2% target but it will not remain there for long. Prices fell by 0.8% in January 2016 and unless that fall is replicated next month (which it won’t be), inflation will rise. It is likely to hit 2% by the spring and 3% by the end of the year, unless the price-fixing deal for oil falls apart and the cost of crude comes crashing down again. Historically, an inflation rate of 2% to 3% is relatively modest for the UK. It will still be enough, however, to put a pronounced squeeze on living standards next year, because prices are going to rise faster than wages.",diasaster:0},

(3) Say that because of the crowds at the frontier and the increasing danger of terrorism, we are obliged, as a temporary measure, to introduce visas for EU citizens travelling to the UK.

Francis Farley Visiting professor, University of Southampton • You report (13 December) the House of Lords committee on Brexit’s argument that the process of withdrawal from the EU will be hard and damaging, but focus mainly on tariffs. Philip Hammond and Peter Lilley did the same in answering questions on the Radio 4 Today programme on Tuesday morning. But the difficulty does not lie with tariffs so much as with regulations and product standards, which pro-Brexit politicians have either ignored or been naively over-optimistic about. We need a carefully managed trade relationship with the EU during and after any transition period. This means product standards not just for final products (cars, washing machines, electronic goods, machine tools) but for all the stages of the supply chain. Mutual recognition between the UK and EU will deal with some of this; but only some. Tariffs threaten relatively small increases in costs, except, as your figures show, in agriculture. Scrapping agreed product standards risks unpicking supply chains built up over 40 years which are now the core of much of our industry. Chris Farrands Nottingham • Your editorial (12 December) addresses the problems that Brexit has brought to Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic. There is a very simple solution that sane people in the UK and Ireland would embrace. Northern Ireland, which voted to remain in the EU, should join the Irish Republic. This gets rid of the border problem. To allow citizens of “New Ireland” to travel and work freely in the UK, as now, they could be given dual citizenship with a UK passport as well as an Irish passport. The UK could also give them tariff-free trade. All the Irish people would get everything they want. A few people might miss having the Queen as head of state, but this is surely a small price to pay for all the benefits, including peace. If it really worries them, they could go to the New UK to live.

{ "title":"The Guardian view on Southern rail: the wrong kind of minister", "content": "Train companies are not in the business of telling their passengers not to travel, but that is what Southern rail is doing this week. The company’s trains have no drivers, since they are now on strike. Unless the talks announced late on Tuesday afternoon are successful, the franchise is set to be hit by more industrial action next week, and over the new year, and again for the first full working week of January. Some of those will be walkouts by conductors in the RMT union alone, but others will involve drivers who are members of the RMT or Aslef. What will that be like? If today’s scenes are anything to go by, absolute mayhem: 1,000 drivers on strike, 156 stations rendered temporarily useless and about 600,000 journeys stymied in what transport analysts estimate is the worst rail disruption in two decades. More than 300,000 passengers will doubtless be hoping for a breakthrough at any talks. Achieving a lasting detente will be a feat indeed. The nub of this dispute is whether Southern trains need guards, but what makes it so hard to resolve is that relations between the unions, Southern’s management and – crucially – the government are now toxic. Witness this week’s claim from transport secretary Chris Grayling that Mick Whelan, Aslef’s head, had “promised 10 years of strikes” – and the response from the normally measured Mr Whelan that the minister was lying and that the breakdown in trust was now total. This is extraordinary stuff, and it leads to a conclusion that Mr Grayling’s role in this dispute has been utterly counterproductive. The transport secretary is presiding over the biggest rail strike since privatisation in 1994 and, rather than do all he can to resolve it, he appears to be playing the most mischievously political role possible. Such behaviour is of a piece with a man who last week was revealed to have objected to Transport for London taking over suburban rail services, a proposal of the then mayor Boris Johnson, because it could give more power to a Labour mayor. Mr Grayling has a reputation as the sort of politician who, given a choice between playing the man or the ball, would hack at the man every time. No doubt that helps score the odd point, but it will not fix the crisis Britain’s railways are now in. Make no mistake, Southern is no ordinary franchise. If even at the outset rail was judged a privatisation too far, then Southern’s parent, Govia Thameslink, was definitely a franchise too large. The biggest in the country, it runs the most economically important rail services in the UK – stretching from Peterborough to Brighton, ferrying commuters across the south coast into London Bridge and Victoria, and taking business travellers to Gatwick and Luton airports. Even before these strikes, GTR’s record was lamentable: cancelling more trains than every other rail company in Britain put together. It is also the most botched of all the privatisations. GTR is purely a fee-for-service provider, paid billions by the government for running this apology of a service, which then takes the ticket receipts and even refunds the customers when trains are delayed (which is painfully often). The GTR management team are thus government agents, paid lavishly for their failures. Such a system exposes GTR to none of the market discipline that John Major promised at the great rail sell-off of 1994. It gives it little incentive to improve and it forces the government to sort any industrial dispute. That is Mr Grayling’s job. Either he does it, or Theresa May should find someone who can.",diasaster:0},

There were no licences awarded in Scotland, where there is a moratorium against fracking, or in Wales, before the introduction of the Wales bill. Cuadrilla, GDF Suez, Hutton Energy, UK Oil and Gas, and Aurora Energy Resources won licences; the biggest winner was Ineos, the Anglo-Swiss chemicals group, with 21 licences. The Oil and Gas Authority chief executive, Andy Samuel, said: “I am pleased that the 14th onshore round attracted strong interest and a high quality of proposed work programmes. This round enables a significant amount of the UK’s shale prospects to be taken forward to be explored and tested. “Upon acceptance of these offers, applicants will be issued with licences and will be able to begin planning their future strategies for exploration activities. These will be subject to further local planning, safety, environmental and other authorisations.” The oil and gas industry claims the development of a successful fracking industry is essential to reduce the UK’s dependence on overseas energy. “At the beginning of this century, we were energy independent, producing enough oil and gas from the North Sea to provide for everyone in the UK,” said Ken Cronin, chief executive of United Kingdom Onshore Oil and Gas, which represents the industry. “Today we are dependent for nearly 50% of our oil and gas from overseas and that is going to rise to over 75% in the next 15 years without further onshore production,” he added. The Ineos chairman, Jim Ratcliffe, said: “We are delighted with today’s announcement. The UK government has demonstrated it is determined to move forward with this exciting new industry. This is the start of a shale gas revolution that will transform manufacturing in the UK. Ineos has the skills to safely extract the gas and we have already committed to both fully consult and to share the rewards with the local communities.” Ineos plans to meet with local communities in the regions where they have won licences in an effort to bring them on side. The group is committed to sharing 6% of its revenues, with 4% of this going to the landowner and 2% to the community. The group has committed to £400m of work in its plans. The majority of the Ineos licences are in former mining communities in the north-west, North Yorkshire and the east Midlands. But greener parts of the country are also headed for a period of exploration before it is determined whether they can profitably and safely produce oil and gas. Campaigners warned that the licences mean vast swaths of British countryside have been opened up to fracking. Greenpeace energy campaigner Hannah Martin said: “Just days after an historic agreement at the Paris climate summit to move towards a renewable energy future – the UK government’s gung ho approach to a new fossil fuel industry is bizarre and irresponsible. “The future economic benefits of fracking are often touted as a key argument for investment in shale gas drilling. But when companies like Cuadrilla are majority owned by firms based in offshore tax havens, it raises serious questions about where the profits would go.” On Wednesday, MPs voted to allow fracking under Britain’s national parks, drawing accusations that the government had sneaked the measure through parliament without a proper debate. Martin added: “Even worse, the government seems to be saying it’s open season on the UK’s rural landscapes, forcing fracking on a reluctant public and on our most precious areas ... Now that fracking under national parks and other protected areas has been pushed through, it seems that nowhere is sacred.”",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"To A New Definition of Opera review – Stockhausen lights up a dim evening", "content": "Now in its third year, the London contemporary music festival (LCMF) showcases many aspects of today’s music that are bypassed elsewhere. A map of the connections between the compers and performers included in the programme would zigzag across many stylistic and conceptual boundaries, and to judge from the evening that went under the title of To a New Definition of Opera, LCMF’s predominantly young, enthusiastic audience happily commutes across all those boundaries too. This long evening cannily kept the best until last: the UK premiere of Karlheinz Stockhausen’s Pietà, part of Dienstag aus Licht (Tuesday from Light) from his week-long opera cycle. Phenomenal trumpeter Marco Blaauw plays a long flugelhorn solo counterpointing Eve’s soothing words, sung by Lore Lixenberg. It is a compelling mix of musical images, and a genuine demonstration of one of the 20th century’s great composers redefining opera on his own terms. The rest of the evening, though, did little to justify its provocative label. In the other UK premiere from the last century, Lixenberg and the baritone Robert Gildon sang extracts from Le Testament de Villon, the opera that Ezra Pound wrote in the 1920s about the life of the 15th-century poet François Villon. It makes rough and ready settings of Villon’s poetry and adds approximate counterpoints to them, mostly for solo violin (performed by Aisha Orazbayeva), and are less a foray into modernism and more a half-baked retreat into pre-operatic archaism. But the poverty of the rest of the programme – Ryan Trecartin’s manically hyperactive Venice Biennale film Center Jenny, rather unfocused sections from Tim Parkinson’s Time with People, and Sue Tompkins’ performance poetry-cum-karaoke, Like Sake – raised the question of why those working in such areas should ever want their work to be called opera at all, as if that would legitimise something that ought to be able to stand on its own terms.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"The Guardian view on Shirley Williams: a dignified departure", "content": "It would be convenient in politics if private principle and party loyalty always pulled in the same direction. In reality, they often compete, and the decision to prioritise one over the other is a painful one. Shirley Williams, who has announced her retirement from the House of Lords, has dealt with more than her fair share of such dilemmas. Many on the left have not forgiven her as one of the Gang of Four schismatics from Labour in 1981. But viewed without partisan rancour, it was also an act of great courage to accept that she and her old party must part company. A generation later, as a Liberal Democrat peer, Baroness Williams confronted difficult choices on the other end of the spectrum in coalition with Tories. Again, critics say she mismanaged the compromise: condemning Andrew Lansley’s health reforms, then endorsing a watered-down variant; putting her Catholicism ahead of her liberalism in arguments over gay marriage. It is possible to disagree with the position and still appreciate that it flowed from conviction. Between the controversies were lesser known but important contributions to debates on education, the health service, the Middle East, nuclear proliferation. Baroness Williams’s integrity is the trait that has made her a popular national figure. It is expressed by her decision to quit the Lords. Many peers treat the upper chamber as a kind of political Hotel California – checking out without ever leaving. Baroness Williams takes the dignified path in stepping down, consistent with the principled determination she has shown in 50 years of public service.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Peter Dickinson obituary", "content": "Peter Dickinson, who has died aged 88, was a prolific novelist for adults and children. He was admired by critics and readers alike and had the distinction of being the first author to twice receive the prestigious Carnegie medal, awarded annually by librarians for the year’s outstanding new children’s book. He won in consecutive years, in 1980 for Tulku and in 1981 for City of Gold and Other Stories from the Old Testament. His first novel for children, The Weathermonger, was published in 1968, and was followed swiftly by Heartsease (1969) and The Devil’s Children (1970), all three set at the time of the “changes”; British society is rejecting machines, turning backwards towards the middle ages and embracing a dark age of ignorance, suspicion and malevolence. Good adventures brilliantly imagined unfold in each, and the structure of the trilogy – although written first, the events in The Weathermonger come at the end of the sequence – brought Dickinson great praise. His ability to create new worlds – what he described as “science fiction without the science” – while also keeping up a page-turning pace was refreshing. Tulku, 1979, Peter Dickinson’s children’s historical novel set in China and Tibet at the time of the Boxer Rebellion. After the Changes trilogy, which was adapted for BBC television as The Changes in 1975, Dickinson kept up a phenomenal output of titles. He was admired for the originality and range of his stories and the variety of settings he explored in them. While his themes were serious and posed dilemmas designed to provoke thought in young readers, his books were never overwhelmed by issues or designed to solve problems, either those of individuals or the world in general. Describing his approach, Dickinson said: “My purpose in writing a children’s book is to tell a story, and everything is secondary to that; but when secondary considerations arise they have to be properly dealt with. Apart from that I like my stories exciting and as different as possible from the one I wrote last time.” Dickinson seemed able to fulfil this ambition with remarkable ease. He was as sure-footed in realistic stories as in fantasies and had a rare ability to blend mystery and fantasy with realism. He set his books in other countries and times to great effect: The Dancing Bear (1972) is set in Byzantium in the sixth century; while The Blue Hawk (1976), which won Dickinson the Guardian children’s book prize in 1977, takes its inspiration from a country that might be Egypt, with a setting steeped in religion that could be the past or the future. Religion is also at the heart of Tulku, a story set in China and Tibet at the time of the Boxer Rebellion, which won the Whitbread children’s book award as well as the Carnegie medal. Second of four sons of Nancy (nee Lovemore) and Richard, Peter was born in Northern Rhodesia (now Zambia), in the city of Livingstone, “within earshot of Victoria Falls” as he described it, where his father worked in the colonial civil service. The family returned to Britain in 1935 and Peter was subsequently educated at Eton, where he was a King’s Scholar (1941-46), and at King’s College, Cambridge (1948-51) where he studied classics and English. On graduating, in 1952 he joined Punch magazine, a decision he later claimed to have taken “purely accidentally”; he was the youngest member of staff by almost a couple of decades. Dickinson stayed at Punch for 17 years, working under three editors, including Malcolm Muggeridge, and ended up as deputy editor. The Blue Hawk, 1976, which won the Guardian children’s fiction prize Dickinson’s many roles at Punch included reviewing detective fiction. From these books, he got an idea for a detective novel of his own. His first adult novel, Skin Deep (also known as The Glass-Sided Ants’ Nest), was published in 1968 and won the Crime Writers’ Association Gold Dagger for crime novel of the year, as did its sequel A Pride of Heroes (1969). While writing his detective story, Dickinson also began work on The Weathermonger. He had a gift for language and was a natural storyteller; on long car journeys he would entertain his own children with the stories he was writing or adapting. Producing a children’s book almost every year, with no diminution in quality, variety or depth, throughout the 1970s, 80s and 90s, and with titles including Eva (1988), AK (1990), The Kin (1998), The Ropemaker (2001) and its sequel Angel Isle (2006), and several picture books as well, Dickinson continued to be annually shortlisted for several major book awards. He was a runner up to be children’s laureate in its inaugural year, 1999. His output for adults also continued, but at a slower rate. There was a collection of poems, The Weir (2007), and the short-story collections Elementals: Water (2002) and Fire: Tales of Elemental Spirits (2009), both written with his second wife, the children’s author Robin McKinley, and Earth and Air: Tales of Elemental Creatures (2012), as a sole author. Dickinson was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of Literature in 1999 and appointed OBE in 2009. His first wife, Mary Rose Barnard, whom he married in 1953, died in 1988. Dickinson is survived by Robin, whom he married in 1991; and by the two daughters, Philippa (the children’s publisher) and Polly, and two sons, John (the children’s author) and James, of his first marriage. • Peter Malcolm de Brissac Dickinson, writer, born 16 December 1927; died 16 December 2015",diasaster:0},

The Lib Dem peer will step down in the new year and will be honoured by her party with a reception on Thursday night. Lady Williams, 85, was a Labour cabinet minister in the 1970s before becoming one of the gang of four who formed the Social Democratic party. She became the first SDP member elected in a byelection in 1981 before losing her seat two years later. She was then president of the new party and supported its merger with the Liberals to form the Liberal Democrats. Williams spent time as a politics professor at Harvard University, as well as lecturing at Cambridge, Princeton, Berkeley and Chicago. She later married the Harvard professor and historian Richard Neustadt, who died in 2003. The Lib Dem grandee was appointed to the Lords in 1993, served as a leader of her party’s peers and became an adviser on nuclear proliferation to Gordon Brown when he was prime minister. Williams continued to play an active part in the second chamber under the Lib Dem-Conservative coalition. Initially, she opposed the government’s health reforms, describing them as stealth privatisation. She was then criticised after deciding to support the government’s modified proposals, backing the decision of the then deputy prime minister Nick Clegg at the 2012 Lib Dem conference. Williams spoke against gay marriage in the Lords and defended the party’s former chief executive Lord Rennard after he denied inappropriately touching young female activists. There was later found to be not enough evidence against him for disciplinary action. Shirley Williams: My family values Read more Ahead of her retirement reception, Tom McNally, the former leader of the Lib Dems in the Lords, said: “Throughout her life, Shirley has made an outstanding contribution to the politics of this country. “Her bravery, determination and commitment to her beliefs has benefited both parliamentary debate and public discourse for the last five decades. “Shirley is a remarkable woman and it has been a huge privilege to work alongside her for all these years.” Williams was also due to be praised at the reception by Clegg and Bill Rodgers, one of the original gang of four, for her “outstanding contribution” to public life. She published her life story in an autobiography called Climbing the Bookshelves in 2009, in which Williams wrote of her childhood as the daughter of the author Vera Brittain. Her first husband was the philosopher Bernard Williams, with whom she had a daughter, but they later divorced. Her first seat for Labour was Hitchin in 1964, which she lost when Margaret Thatcher came to power in 1979. During her time as a cabinet minister under James Callaghan, she had responsibility for prices and consumer protection at a time when inflation was above 13%. As education secretary, she oversaw the growth of comprehensive schools under Labour and was known for her passionate opposition to grammar schools.",diasaster:0},

Some went beyond the “new realism” that Rogers describes and sought an indigenous readership.

{ "title":"Fawlty’s still funny but class doesn’t raise a laugh any more", "content": "Aside from its quality, there is one key reason Fawlty Towers hasn’t aged as badly as its contemporaries: the edits. Its producers doubled the average number of cuts per episode, to something approaching what’s common today. So rather than proceeding with the creak and tedium of, say, Bless This House, it whips along – despite stagey blocking, despite farce roots. But the reason it still feels culturally distant – as testified by the repeat last week of the brilliant Communication Difficulties to commemorate the death of Andrew Sachs – is that its primary preoccupation is class. Sitcoms in the 70s were fixated on the thwarted social ambitions of middle-aged men. The first ever Fawlty Towers episode in 1975 sees Basil hoodwinked by an upper-crust conman; two months later, in an episode of Rising Damp, Rigsby falls victim to the exact same scam. The achilles heel of these two and numerous others was a desperation to rise above the riffraff. Fawlty Towers stars John Cleese and Connie Booth salute Andrew Sachs Read more Last Saturday saw an airing, without obvious peg, of the last ever episode of Dad’s Army – immediately identifiable as such by the baggy pace, heady sentimentality and genuinely immense age of the cast (you don’t see wrinkles as distinguished as John Le Mesurier’s on primetime any more). That series hinged on the tension of Mainwaring’s attempts to assert authority over the polished public schoolboy Wilson. Made in 1977, the episode includes a beautifully played heart-to-heart in which Mainwaring explains how he himself battled snobbishness to marry the daughter of the Suffragan Bishop of Clegthorpe [sic], whom he’d had to introduce to ketchup. “Marrying you must have opened up a whole new world for her,” nods Wilson, winningly. Today, class tension is not a live issue in anything like the same way. The departure of David Cameron has loosened the Eton stranglehold a little. The rage of the squeezed middle, more than the squashed poor, is credited for Brexit. Quietly, the inequality gaps have become about wealth itself, as well as gender, race and sexuality – not class. Accordingly, today’s acclaimed British sitcoms – Fleabag, Motherland, Mum, Catastrophe – are not about a 50-year-old property owner failing to better himself. They’re about women struggling with sex, rent, men and children. And sometimes they’re almost as funny. Sometimes. The dress code for Christmas Magazines at the moment are chocka with frocks for this year’s festive dos. The slinkiest heels to take you from work to party to A&E, the best clutches to leave on the bus. Pregnancy relieves you of such concerns: whatever you wear you’ll just look whopping, yet people will feel the need to not be too bitchy. But, in fact, such sartorial loopholes are available to all, for the dominant aesthetic of Christmas secretly conspires against the dress code dictated by the Sunday supplements. Turn up at a party wearing oversized pullover featuring gurning turkey, and people will applaud your seasonal cheer. Hair is granted a particularly free pass, with everyday outfits allowed to be capped with a bobble hat. Even at posh suppers, the wearing of a paper crown from the cracker is actively encouraged. If you look a tip, Christmas is truly a gift. Time’s running out for Rolex I’ve been given a couple of nice watches for Christmas, and proved horribly adept at losing them. They were lovely but, I hope, not massively expensive. Investing an inordinate amount of money in something not only that you’re likely to take off a lot, but that is so conspicuous, so eminently stealable, has long seemed strange to me. So it’s good to see the world’s super-wealthy are cottoning on. Not only have sales of Rolexes plummeted this year, but the incidence of them being returned for a refund has skyrocketed. The credit crunch is thanked, but I think it’s more down to the eventual emergence of common sense. Plus, of course, nobody needs a watch any more.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"When, where and why is the Southern rail strike taking place?", "content": "No trains are running at all on Southern’s network on Tuesday morning, leaving hundreds of thousands of passengers in Sussex, Surrey and beyond stranded. It is the biggest strike on the railways since privatisation in 1994, as drivers from the Aslef union have followed conductors from the RMT in taking industrial action in the long-running dispute on Britain’s biggest commuter franchise. When are the strikes? The drivers’ strikes – which have the biggest effect, stopping all Southern trains – started on Tuesday and will continue on Wednesday 14 December and Friday 16 December. Another six-day walkout is scheduled from Monday 9 January. Conductors will strike on Monday 19 and Tuesday 20 December and from New Year’s Eve until Monday 2 January. Drivers have also voted for an indefinite overtime ban, which will severely disrupt services every day, even without strikes. Southern rail strike begins after court rejects appeal – live updates Read more Why are the latest strikes taking place? The dispute is over driver-only operation of trains on the franchise. That means changes to the role of conductors, who are now being rebranded as “onboard supervisors”. They will no longer close the doors on new trains being brought into operation. Unions claim that this practice is unsafe, and fear that once the safety-critical tasks of the conductor are removed, jobs will be at risk. Although Southern’s owner, Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR), has promised not to axe jobs, and says it will normally run trains with a second staff member aboard, it wants to retain the right to run trains with one. Aslef had attempted to join the RMT strikes from the beginning of the dispute in spring, but was blocked by a court injunction won by GTR. Is driver-only operation of trains unsafe? GTR, the Rail Safety and Standards Board and most of the industry says it is safe, and points out that it is longstanding practice in some parts of the rail network, including in Southern’s sister Thameslink services in the wider GTR franchise. Unions question the independence of the safety board, whose directors include GTR’s chief executive, and argue that the conditions of modern railways – with longer trains and far more passengers – are not comparable to the days when they accepted the principle of one crew member on board. Drivers’ union Aslef argues that CCTV does not give the same level of oversight as a conductor would have in closing the doors. What other factors are causing disruption on Southern? As commuters are well aware, problems long pre-date the strikes. Management admitted to staff shortages when its franchise started, but the poor situation has been made worse by the need to take out more drivers to act as trainers, or to be trained themselves on the new rolling stock. Higher than usual levels of sickness – labelled by Southern and the government as unofficial industrial action, to the fury of unions – has further worsened the situation. Much of the network, including the Brighton mainline, is regarded as having insufficient capacity to run enough trains for the demand. Large-scale engineering works, including the overhaul of London Bridge, have been another source of major disruption. Random events such as breakdowns, flooding and sinkholes have also struck the luckless Southern, and with resources stretched to the limit and staff goodwill broken down, the knock-on effects of such incidents can be more extreme. Is there an end in sight to the dispute? Only the scale of the disruption and the public outcry would suggest action is imminent – otherwise, the rift between unions and the train company and the government is wider than ever. GTR have in theory offered talks at Acas on Tuesday, but only on condition that unions abandon their strikes. But Aslef said that the company had been unwilling to negotiate until the strikes were reality. Previous talks between the RMT and GTR have collapsed. Both sides have claimed talks are pointless because neither will come without preconditions. Chris Grayling, the transport secretary, has only offered a meeting if unions commit to abandoning strike action – but has also said he will not get involved in direct talks. In any case, after Grayling told MPs on Monday that Mick Whelan, Aslef’s general secretary, had “promised 10 years of strikes”, Whelan responded that Grayling was lying and betraying a private meeting – and said the breakdown in trust was now total, and extended to the government. Unions say that overwhelming votes to strike reflect widespread anger at management practices on the franchise. One possible reason for optimism is that unions recently reached a negotiated settlement with Scotrail in a similar dispute, albeit in a very different political environment. Who is to blame? Most commuters think neither the RMT nor the management are blameless. Unions are seeking guarantees over future roles that appear to be untenable. Southern has clearly had some management problems. Meanwhile ,Grayling – who was revealed last week to have suggested blocking Transport for London taking over more rail commuter services in the capital, a move supported by all parties, because it would come under the control of a Labour mayor – certainly isn’t making industrial relations any easier. But the broader context is that government has been looking to cut costs and bring in more automation on the rail network. Trains have been ordered with a view to driver-only operation, and franchises structured on the basis such changes are made. Speeches by senior rail officials at the Department for Transport have further exposed the government’s wider agenda, which unions fear will spread across the country. That may be a path to cheaper railways, but unions fear it will mean job losses, and that – for all the assurances on Southern now – future franchises will not have a second crew member on board.",diasaster:0},

{ "title":"EU renegotiation: Cameron faces Brussels deadlock over migrants’ benefits", "content": "David Cameron said on Thursday night that he had found a pathway to progress on his mission to create a new settlement with the European Union, after four hours of make-or-break talks with Britain’s European partners ended with an agreement to find a common solution by February. In a late night press conference in Brussels, Cameron said the task ahead was very tough, and emphasised that he had not taken his widely rejected demand for a four-year ban on EU migrants receiving UK in-work benefit off the negotiating table. But other EU leaders said he had backtracked by accepting he could not discriminate against citizens other EU member states. In perhaps the most encouraging response in the wake of the meeting, Germany’s Angela Merkel said it may be possible to agree to a principle of treaty change now, but to implement those treaty changes later. She said: “We made it clear that we are ready to compromise, but always on the basis that we safeguard the core European principles, which include non-discrimination and free movement. “Especially regarding the fourth pillar [on welfare benefits] it won’t be easy, but I still think that with good will we can find good solutions.” Cameron was reluctant to say if any alternative to his plan to curb EU migration through a four-year EU benefits ban had been advanced by his partners. He also denied claims by the French president François Hollande that Britain was now set on course for a referendum in the summer. Donald Tusk, the EU council’s president, said he did not want to sound too dramatic in advance, but the meeting had been “a make-or-break moment”. Although hard work lay ahead, he said he planned to produce a concrete text ahead of the next EU summit in February. He said: “The most important thing was atmosphere and good will”. Tusk accepted the issue of welfare and free movement remained “the most delicate and difficult”. “We have to respect what David Cameron has said and we have to respect some members’ needs,” added Tusk. “Truly speaking we are absolutely sure we have to be tough with regard to some red lines and we will not give up on free movement or unfair discrimination, but today I know David Cameron is looking for a fair solution. “To me the clearest message is that no one including David Cameron is ready to accept discrimination.” Facebook Twitter Pinterest Donald Tusk, president of the European council, called the meeting a ‘make or break moment’. Photograph: Wiktor Dabkowski/dpa/Corbis The three alternative solutions remain a shorter ban on access to benefits, an emergency brake that allows the UK to put a halt to EU migration if the flows become excessive and a ban on both UK and EU citizens receiving benefits until they have made social security contributions for a fixed period. Cameron said the British government was attempting “something very tough by holding a referendum at a time of our choosing with a mandate from the British people”. Insisting there was momentum behind his campaign, he added there was “enormous support for keeping the UK in the EU”. He added: “They [the British people] want to know that this is not an unstoppable EU. They want to know that this is not a single currency club. They want to know that this organisation is adding to competitiveness, and they want to know it is not creating unsustainable pressure on migration.” The opposition to the centrepiece of the prime minister’s renegotiation came not just from France and Germany, but more than a dozen EU countries including Poland, Czech Republic, Hungary and Slovakia – the four east European states who would be most affected by Cameron’s benefits curbs. The dissent suggested Cameron’s eight-month-long diplomatic tour of EU capitals has brought him only limited rewards. In Cameron’s speech at the start of a working dinner, designed to reset Britain’s 42-year-old uneasy relationship with the European Union, he again set out the case for a four-year ban on migrants’ benefits and stressed that mass migration could yet drive the UK from the EU. But he also said he was willing to shelve his specific proposal as long as any alternative effectively addressed UK voters’ concerns about migration. In his single longest intervention to EU partners in six years, Cameron urged the leaders to recognise the unique nature of the British problem on migration, and its interaction with Britain’s welfare system. He said: “The levels of migration we have seen in a relatively short period of time are unprecedented, including the pressures this places on communities and public services. This is a major concern of the British people that is undermining support for the European Union. We need to find an effective answer to this problem. “Countries need flexibility so they can make changes to their welfare systems to better manage migration.” He asked his partners: “Are we going to find the flexibility to address the concerns of the UK and work together to fix this?” Cameron also emphasised that British voters have felt let down by broken promises of EU referendums, and that this negotiation, if successful, offered the chance to reach a new settlement that will allow Britain to put the brake on deeper economic integration if that was the chosen path of the eurozone countries. He also stressed there needed to be clear rules codifying the relationship between members of the eurozone and those outside. Cameron also insisted Britain needed to be exempt from the principle of ever closer union set out in the 1957 Treaty of Rome. He said: “We have got to address this worry of the British people that they will be taken against their will into a political project. This is a fear that has undermined British public trust in the EU for a number of years.” Going into the meeting, the prime minister promised to battle for Britain “all night”, but behind the bellicose rhetoric, UK officials stressed he was not seeking a deal that night or detailed negotiations over a text, but instead signs of political momentum that could lead to an agreement at a further summit in February. There has been private concern that the UK’s future relationship with the EU was starting to turn on what may emerge to be a relatively narrow issue of the length of time EU migrants should be making social security contributions in the UK before they can claim in-work benefits. The emphasis has already been questioned by economists from the government’s budget watchdog, the Office for Budget Responsibility, who have suggested a four-year ban will have little practical impact on the number of migrants coming to the UK. The precise number of EU migrants currently claiming benefits in the UK is also a matter of dispute after HMRC rejected a freedom of information request to give up-to-date figures of EU migrants claiming benefits, saying it would interfere with government policymaking and not be helpful to the UK’s negotiations with its EU partners. HMRC later admitted it had withheld the numbers but said it had been wrong to suggest this was linked to the EU negotiations. Downing Street said the figures will be collated in time for a referendum. The EU leaders rejecting the UK’s proposal for a four-year ban on in-work benefits were led by Xavier Bettel, prime minister of Luxembourg and the current holder of the EU’s rotating presidency. He said: “There are clear red lines and I don’t think that many other people will support Mr Cameron in the direction of limiting those values on which Europe has been constructed. He made a series of proposals, but there are also limits that aren’t acceptable to us.” “There should be possibilities to arrive at solutions if there’s a readiness for movement on all sides,” the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, told reporters. “We’d like to preserve Great Britain as a member, without however restricting the basic freedoms – non-discrimination, freedom of movement.” “We want to listen to Mr Cameron,” the French president, François Hollande, said. “We know his proposals, but they’ll be clarified: if they are in line with European agreements, there can be a negotiation, otherwise the negotiation will be a bit more difficult.” Cameron also encountered opposition to his proposal first-hand as he met with the prime ministers of the four eastern EU states collectively known as the Visegrad group: Poland, Czech Republic, Hungary and Slovakia. In a joint statement after that meeting, the four leaders cited freedom of movement as one of the EU’s “fundamental values”, and said they would not support “any solutions which would be discriminatory or limit free movement”. Martin Schulz, a German socialist who is president of the European parliament, said that Cameron has to come toward the EU position rather than the other way around. “It’s not like it’s us who invented this referendum,” he said. All other 27 EU nations have to agree to any UK change, so even if Cameron can convince his closest allies, such as the Dutch and Danish, it will count for nothing if he cannot overcome other objections.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"The Wasp review – tables turned on a school bully", "content": "When Heather was at school she had plaits, glasses, low self-esteem and a gang of bullies on her case. Now, 20 years on, she wears pashmina shawls and has a comfortable home and cash to splash. Heather’s life is in sharp contrast to the existence of one of her major tormentors, Carla, the former best friend who turned on her viciously at the end of year seven, and made Heather feel fearful for the rest of her time at school. Carla got pregnant straight after leaving school, led a hand-to-mouth existence living with a loser of a partner twice her age, and will shortly give birth to her fifth child. But when Heather arranges a meeting with the woman she hasn’t seen since school, it is not to gloat. She comes with a bag stuffed with money and a business proposition. Morgan Lloyd Malcolm’s two-hander is an enjoyably nasty, if not always totally believable thriller, that revels in unexpected plot twists as the power balance between the two women appears to shift first one way and then the other as the audience’s sympathies see-saw. With her difficult background, maybe Carla had reasons for behaving so badly and deserves forgiveness? Surely Heather has moved on from the frightened, bullied teenager she once was? Maybe they can come together as unexpected allies? The sharp comic edge to the writing ensures that the malice is made somewhat more palatable, and terrific performances from MyAnna Buring as Carla, desperate for a new life for her and her kids, and Laura Donnelly as the apparently together and business-like Heather, keep this watchable.

{ "title":"Muslim Brotherhood are possible extremists, David Cameron says", "content": "David Cameron has described members of the Muslim Brotherhood as possible extremists but stopped short of banning the group after a long-delayed official inquiry into its activities in Britain. The prime minister said the review found the Islamist organisation, of which the ousted Egyptian president Mohamed Morsi is a senior member, had had significant influence in groups claiming to speak for British Muslims. He added that the Brotherhood, which is opposed by some Gulf states, characterised the UK as fundamentally hostile to Muslim faith and identity and had expressed support for terrorist attacks by the Palestinian Islamist group Hamas. “The main findings of the review support the conclusion that membership of, association with, or influence by the Muslim Brotherhood should be considered as a possible indicator of extremism,” Cameron said in a written ministerial statement to MPs. “Parts of the Muslim Brotherhood have a highly ambiguous relationship with violent extremism.” The prime minister’s statement went far further than expected, and the report ends by claiming that “aspects of Muslim Brotherhood ... are contrary to our values and have been contrary to our national interests and our national security”. The review was undertaken by the former British ambassador to Saudi Arabia, Sir John Jenkins, and Charles Farr, the director general of the office for security and counterterrorism in the Home Office. The findings were due to be published in July 2014 but have been long delayed, with no explanation from Downing Street. An 11-page summary makes it clear the government accepts that the “Muslim Brotherhood has not been linked to terrorist-related activity in and against the UK” and has “often condemned terrorist-related activity in the UK associated with al-Qaida”. However, the report raises concerns over the “sometimes secretive, if not clandestine” way the Brotherhood operated in the recent past and noted it sought to shape – by stealth – Muslim thinking through three UK mainstream organisations: the Muslim Association of Britain, the Muslim Council of Britain and the Islamic Society of Britain, which has now disowned its roots. The Jenkins report says that “for some years the Muslim Brotherhood shaped the [then] new Islamic Society of Britain, dominated the Muslim Association of Britain and played an important role in establishing and then running the Muslim Council of Britain.” It says in its conclusions: “Much about the Muslim Brotherhood in the UK remains secretive, including membership, fundraising and educational programmes. But Muslim Brotherhood associates and affiliates here have at times had significant influence on the largest UK Muslim student organisation, national organisations which have claimed to represent Muslim communities (and on that basis have sought and had a dialogue with government), charities and some mosques. “Though their domestic influence has declined, organisations associated with the Muslim Brotherhood continue to have an influence here which is disproportionate to their size.” The report also concludes that while engagement with the government has at times been facilitated by what appeared to be a common agenda against al-Qaida and militant Salafism: “But this engagement did not take account of Muslim Brotherhood support for a proscribed terrorist group and its views about terrorism which, in reality, were quite different from our own.” The prime minister said that under the new counter-extremism strategy, ministers would ensure that government did not inadvertently provide legitimacy or a platform for extremists and would keep the question of banning the Muslim Brotherhood under review. Last month, the Guardian revealed that the United Arab Emirates, dominated by the oil-rich emirate of Abu Dhabi, threatened to block billion-pound arms deals with the UK, stop inward investment and cut intelligence cooperation if Britain did not act against the Muslim Brotherhood, which it regards as a terrorist outfit. UAE told UK: crack down on Muslim Brotherhood or lose arms deals Read more A trio of the UK’s closest allies in the Arab world – Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the UAE – have all complained that London is a base for the Brotherhood, which began and was developed in Egypt. These Arab nations have all outlawed the group and accused it of links to terrorism. The Brotherhood denies this, saying it is a peaceful political movement. The report accepts that the organisation has opted for “non-violent incremental change on the grounds of expediency”. The Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood said Cameron was effectively condemning millions of Muslims as extremists and its lawyers were putting together a case to take the government to court. Its foreign relations chief, Yehia Hamed, said the report was not based on credible evidence or a proper review process. The South Asian versions of the Brotherhood were also criticised. One such group – the Islamic Forum for Europe – was shown to be privately advocating sharia law in Tower Hamlets, east London. The Brotherhood, founded in Egypt in 1928, grew into an international organisation with chapters across the Muslim world. The report says that while it has been non-violent and taken part in democratic elections in Egypt and Tunisia, the “Muslim Brotherhood at all levels have repeatedly defended Hamas attacks against Israel, including the use of suicide bombers”. While the armed wing of Hamas is banned in Britain, the organisation’s political wing has held talks with senior UK officials – most recently this year with the former prime minister, Tony Blair, who reportedly invited Hamas’s leader to the UK. Cameron said the government would keep a close watch on the views promoted by Brotherhood associates in Britain in Arabic and English, as well as their activities. Britain would also continue to refuse visas to members and associates of the Brotherhood who were on record as having made extremist comments. There would be a particular focus on fundraising in Britain for the Brotherhood to ensure that money raised by charities with links to the organisation was not used to finance it, he said. The Liberal Democrat leader, Tim Farron, said the Jenkins review had been requested by the Saudi government and “shines a light into the shady corners of our relationship with the kingdom. We should decide these things based on real and credible intelligence and not pressure from Riyadh,” he said. “We need to be less of a slavish ally and more critical of their role both within the region and on human rights. We are now calling on the government to start a formal inquiry into the external funding for extremist perversions of Islam.”",diasaster:0},

{ "title":"US travel ban leaves Iranian LGBT refugees in limbo", "content": "Gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender refugees from Iran have found themselves caught between a rock and a hard place after Donald Trump’s executive order banning entry for people from seven Muslim-majority countries. US travel ban puts 20,000 refugees in 'precarious circumstances', UN says Read more The order also suspended the US refugee admissions system for 120 days, and promised to prioritise members of religious minorities. But it made no mention of people facing persecution for their sexual orientation, and several gay Iranians who have fled a country where homosexuality is punishable by death are now left stuck in Turkey, where they say they are experiencing worse homophobic abuses than in their homeland. Some of the refugees have already had their asylum applications approved by the UN refugee agency and were due to be resettled in the US after months or even years of interviews and security checks. Mitra, a 27-year-old lesbian living in Denizli, a conservative city in south-west Turkey, left Iran in 2014 after receiving death threats because of her activities as the editor of Aghaliat, an online magazine focusing on LGBT issues. She was granted refugee status by the UN nearly two years ago, and was due to attend her final interview this month before being resettled in the US. “They have just called me and said it’s all cancelled,” she said. Until Trump’s ban came into force, the US was the only viable path to safety for gay Iranians who end up in Turkey. Canada no longer accepts them because it is focusing on Syrian refugees. European countries do not normally accept LGBT Iranians who have applied from Turkey. Like many of her fellow minorities, Mitra was initially approved to go to Canada. “I waited for 14 months, [and] even went through the medical checks but one day they called and said Canada doesn’t accept Iranians anymore and I should go to the US. Now that’s up in the air too.” Mitra added: “One by one all my dreams and hopes are being destroyed before my eyes. It doesn’t matter to me whether to go to Canada or the US, I just want to go somewhere – anywhere – safe.” Mitra currently lives with her partner in a tiny room with one sofa that is also their bed. “Iran doesn’t want us, Canada doesn’t want us and now the US doesn’t want us either. I have seen the suicide of three friends since 2015. A gay Iranian [threw] himself off a balcony and an Iranian lesbian hanged herself just eight months ago.” She argued that the US should also make exemptions for sexual minorities as well. “At least with religious refugees, they have the support of their families, we don’t even have that. Our families are [ashamed] of us.” Javad, 50, is a disabled Iranian gay man also living in Turkey. “I was abandoned by my family, I was abandoned by my country and now I [do not] have anywhere to go,” he said. He said two of his friends were beaten up in the street. “One day a friend of mine, an Iranian gay name Pouya, called and said, ‘forgive me’,” he said. “I realised he was about to take his life. “I am disabled, I struggled to get to his house, by the time I got there he had died. He had just had enough.” Saghi Ghahraman, the head of the Canada-based Iranian Queer Organisation, said LGBT Iranians face horrific punishment and bullying. A fatwa issued in 1987 by the late Ayatollah Khomeini legalised transexuality, but social stigma remains still rampant, and homosexuality is still punishable by death. “Up until 2013, the wait-time for the LGBT to be determined and resettled by the [UN high commissioner for refugees] in Turkey was about a year and a half, which was barely manageable,” she said. “But it changed with the war in Syria, and when the USA and Canada undertook resettlement of large number of displaced Syrians, the LGBT wait-time before resettlement went up to three years,” she said. Meanwhile, gay Iranian exiles have been subjected to a string of violent hate attacks and murders in Turkey, said Ghahraman. The 26-year-old Azad, a gay Iranian who was approved for relocation by the UN 23 months ago, said his friend fainted in the bus when he heard about Trump’s decision. “We’re stuck, we can’t go forward, we can’t go backward,” he said. “Turkey is so unstable too these days and anything can happen, what if they deport us back to Iran?”",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Italian banking crisis: UniCredit to raise €13bn", "content": "Italy’s largest bank, UniCredit, plans to shed thousands of jobs and raise €13bn in the country’s biggest share issue in a bid to shore up its reserves and boost profits by the end of the decade. The bank said 14,000 posts, or 11% of the workforce, would disappear across its businesses in Europe and 1,000 bank branches in Italy would close. About €18bn of bad loans are to be offloaded to two new businesses mainly owned by US fund managers. The bank’s shares rose 13% as investors welcomed the “decisive” move by UniCredit to distance itself from Italy’s ailing banking sector, which is hobbled by a legacy of non-performing loans. UniCredit chief executive, Jean Pierre Mustier, in London on Tuesday to talk to shareholders, said the move would allow the bank to offer €55bn of fresh loans to business customers and expand retail lending. Against a backdrop of negative interest rates in the eurozone, which the bank said made it difficult to generate profits, Mustier said without a large injection of fresh capital and a lower ratio of bad loans the bank would be forced to contract further, making bigger job cuts and reducing its capacity to make loans. “We need to turn a page on our legacy issues to improve and support recurring future profitability. The aim is to be one of Europe’s most attractive banks,” he said. UniCredit’s move comes at a troubled time for Italian banks and the economy, with the third-largest bank, Monte dei Paschi di Siena (MPS), negotiating a rescue package, a new government installed in Rome and early elections expected next year. Italy plans Monte dei Paschi di Siena rescue if private bailout fails Read more Mustier said he was confident MPS would reach a deal to offload more than €5bn of loans by the end of the year. He ruled out joining a rescue of MPS or any other Italian bank unless the government forced it to take part in a broader rescue of the banking sector. “We are extremely confident the refinancing will be resolved by the end of the year. Our plan does not depend on a deal for MPS,” he said. “What we are doing shows what other Italian banks can do,” he added, before saying, “We are not interested in buying other Italian banks. Our plan is for organic growth.” If MPS fails to secure the funds, the bank will probably require a government rescue, which could be launched on Friday or next Monday and could mean at least temporary losses for thousands of retail investors. Under EU rules, state intervention can only move forward once junior bondholders have taken a hit, although some retail investors would likely be compensated later. Paolo Gentiloni, Italy’s incoming prime minister, vowed in a speech before parliament that the Italian government was ready to intervene across the Italian banking sector “to ensure the stability of [Italy’s] banking institutions”. UniCredit has already moved 300 staff from London to Milan following Britain’s vote to leave the European Union. Mustier said the Brexit vote was “a huge opportunity” for continental banks, which are untroubled by the prospect of Europe’s financial centre leaving the EU. Benjie Creelan-Sandford, equity analyst at brokers Jefferies, said: “The upfront bill of €13bn is clearly large but as we have highlighted previously we think an aggressive balance sheet clean-up paves the way for a more substantial re-rating. He said the forecast by the bank’s board of €4.7bn net profits in 2019 was well ahead of consensus expectations of €3.9bn. But David Cheetham, an analyst at brokers XTB, was concerned a rescue by the Italian government remained a possibility if UniCredit struggled to raise vital funds. “The Italian lender has endured a torrid time of late and the latest action appears a last-ditch attempt to stave off a government rescue, with the strategy likely to be ultimately decided by how successful the firm raises the target of €13bn,” he said. A group of investment banks have signed a pre-underwriting agreement to help UniCredit market the issue. These include Morgan Stanley, UBS, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, JP Morgan and Mediobanca. The bad loans would be sold to two separate vehicles, one managed by Fortress Investment Group and the other by Pimco, with UniCredit retaining minority stakes in each.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Russia and conflicts of interest: Rex Tillerson embodies quandaries for Trump", "content": "By nominating Rex Tillerson as secretary of state, Donald Trump will ignite a battle in Congress over the two issues that look set to overshadow the opening chapters of his presidency: Russia and conflicts of interest. Tillerson embodies both quandaries. The ExxonMobil executive has grown close to Vladimir Putin and his circle through a succession of oil deals. The fate of those deals would give him a private interest when he comes to negotiate with Moscow as secretary of state. Lifting sanctions would unshackle ExxonMobil’s planned multi-billion dollar operations in Russia, and boost Tillerson’s retirement fund. Rex Tillerson to be Trump's secretary of state, say reports, after Romney reveals he is out Read more His confirmation hearings in the Senate will be a bitter and emotive struggle. For Trump’s legion critics, the opaque ties with Russia and his glaring conflicts of interest represent existential threats to US democracy. Trump is giving the nod to Tillerson, the recipient of Moscow’s Order of Friendship, as a slaughter is underway in Aleppo, likely to be one of the worst war crimes of the century so far, in which Russia is complicit. Furthermore, confirmation hearings will run concurrently with a congressional investigation into what role Russian intelligence played in tilting the US presidential election and giving Trump an edge. The legitimacy of his presidency, for a majority of the US electorate and much of the world beyond, will be at stake in those hearings. At the same time as declaring, by characteristic tweet, that a secretary of state nomination would come on Tuesday, Trump also casually revealed how he would be dealing with his own deep conflicts of interest – by “leaving” his businesses and devolving their management to his two eldest sons, Donald Jr and Eric, while offering that the organisation would do “no new deals” during his time in office. The brief bulletins on Twitter came in place of a promised press conference on the future of his businesses that was to have taken place on Thursday, but was then summarily cancelled. Just before midnight on Monday, Trump tweeted that he would face press questions “in the near future to discuss the business, Cabinet picks and all other topics of interest”. The timing was left vague. His spokeswoman said it would be left until next month. Also left vague was what “leaving” the Trump Organisation would mean – stepping down from management or divesting his ownership stake – or whether selling his share would lessen his conflict of interest as president, if the decisions he takes in the Oval Office could enrich his children. It is also doubtful whether a vast sprawling empire like the Trump Organisation, with a presence in some 20 countries, can function without doing “new deals”. Entering agreements with governments and partners is what it does in its day-to-day operations. US law allows the president to have a conflict of interest. However, if businesses in which he had a stake benefit from payments from foreign governments or foreign state-owned companies, he would risk violating the “emoluments clause” of the constitution. For his part, Tillerson could sell the ExxonMobil stock in his retirement fund, but the question would remain whether that sale would divest him of his loyalty to a company that has employed him for more than four decades, that operates almost as a state itself and outweighs the economies of most of the countries on the planet. Trump's conflicts of interest: a visual guide Read more Trump’s decisions to choose Tillerson, and to keep his business empire in the family, represent acts of defiance of the traditionalists in the Republican party. Veteran senators John McCain and Lindsey Graham will make the Tillerson confirmation, and the investigation into Russian election meddling, trials by fire for the new president. It would take the revolt of just one more Republican senator to rob Trump of his majority. The president-elect may have been encouraged in his choice of Tillerson by the endorsement of grandees from former GOP administrations, including James Baker, Condoleezza Rice and Robert Gates. Their encouragement may soothe nervous Republicans but they have conflict of interest issues of their own. Baker’s law firm represents ExxonMobil and Russian state-owned oil and gas companies. Rice and Gates are partners in an international consulting firm that was reportedly hired by ExxonMobil. One by one, the party leaders that once despised Trump fell into line behind him as his campaign gathered its unexpected momentum. The president-elect is betting the Republicans will line up once more, for fear of missing the opportunity of running all three branches of government. That is a high-stakes gamble. The scale of the business conflicts in the new administration and the blatant influence of Moscow in US politics makes this uncharted territory for all involved.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Urgent Brexit deal needed to avert banking job losses, peers to warn", "content": "Tens of thousands of banking jobs could be lost to continental Europe from next year if ministers do not agree a transitional deal on single market access with the EU, a Lords report on financial services after Brexit is expected to warn. UK naive to expect easy ride in Brexit trade talks, says Lords report Read more Peers on the committee, due to report on Thursday, have been struck by the urgent need for financial institutions to make decisions on their location because they cannot wait until the end of Brexit negotiations in 2019 to find out if they can trade in the single market from London. Graph The committee has been given a range of estimates of the likely job losses across the financial services sector including a claim from Ernst and Young, commissioned by the London Stock Exchange, that 200,000 UK jobs are at stake. The Brexit committee, one of several that has begun looking at the impact of the UK’s planned departure from the EU, has been warned that big banks will start making decisions next year, partly because the relevant financial arrangements take a year to unwind. Banks believe they need clarity on the UK’s trading relationship with the European Union long before the end of article 50 negotiations are due to be completed by the spring of 2019. They fear it could be necessary to relocate from London as soon as possible without transitional arrangements to ensure access to the single market post-Brexit. It is already becoming clear that a dividing line is developing between those ministers who think the complexity of the negotiations mean it is not possible to negotiate a new trading relationship with the EU by autumn 2018, requiring a transitional agreement, and those who think it is feasible simply to leave the EU and then trade with the EU on World Trade Organization terms. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Hammond favours transitional deal with EU – video Philip Hammond, the chancellor, became the clearest cabinet exponent of a transitional agreement on Monday, saying that “thoughtful politicians” increasingly agreed on its importance. However, other ministers, such as the Brexit secretary, David Davis, have said they are more relaxed about the issue. “Passporting” rules currently allow UK-registered financial services firms to sell their products and services throughout the EU without needing to set up a local subsidiary, as well as allowing European banks and fund managers to work freely in London. Much of the evidence from financial firms heard by the Lords committee called for the certainty of transitional trading arrangements between the UK and EU to allow complex negotiations be carried out. The Association of British Insurers told peers that an early agreement on a transitional phase was needed since this would “provide the option for the firms most affected by Brexit not to take swift decisions in 2017 on scaling back”. Philip Hammond says post-Brexit transitional deal will be needed Read more This would require either the UK or the financial services sector to continue paying contributions to the EU in return for access to the single market. Senior Tories, including the former Cabinet Office minister Oliver Letwin, have acknowledged that the insurance retail industry is a special case and fees will have to be paid into the EU if firms are to be allowed to provide services. Committee members have also been struck by warnings from the London Stock Exchange Group chief executive, Xavier Rolet, that the article 50 negotiating process would make it hard to secure the smooth transition that he wanted. Graph Rolet told the inquiry: “Article 50 was designed with exactly the opposite set of objectives in mind; that is, to impose and enforce such a reduced timeline to raise the cost of exiting the EU and make it punitive, or to create a level of uncertainty. This is our number one concern. “If our customers are faced with an uncertain outcome within, say, the next two-and-a-half years, for the protection of their own customers and shareholders they are likely to have to start today to think, plan and execute alternative arrangements. “The real difficulty is that for most financial securities and licences, the delays in securing a licence easily exceed a year; 18 to 24 months is the norm, particularly since in most cases the regulatory environment in Europe is less global, sophisticated and deep than it is in the UK. So the ability to process multiple applications takes time. “It is about ensuring that our customers will not be in a situation in the next two years where all of a sudden they have large amounts of risk or activities that are non-compliant.” The Lords report on financial services is the fourth and probably the most important in a series of agenda-shaping reports from peers that will inform the first phase of the detailed debate on Brexit. Pressure is mounting among business leaders for more clarity from the government on how much time they may have to adjust to a new trade regime, with many warning that a transition phase is only useful if the long-term policy direction is clear. Views are mixed in the City on the likely impact of a hard Brexit. One senior commercial banker described the loss of passporting rights as an “embuggerance” – British military slang for an obstacle in the way of progress – rather than a catastrophe and was more worried about future access to skilled European employees. Some in fund management and insurance are more concerned, while others predict some loss of clearing jobs to rival European centres is inevitable. At a meeting between car manufacturers and Davis on Monday, attendees were said to be heartened that the government increasingly understood the need for them to retain access to European markets but were worried there was little plan for achieving this. Instead, many are now approaching the point where they are having to contemplate the worst-case scenario where departure from the customs union devastates their complex cross-border supply chains. “New products can take years to develop, so we need to know soon how we are going to get them to market,” said one industrialist present at the automotive summit in London, who was sceptical of the “vague assurances” already provided to manufacturers such as Nissan. They also warned Davis that their factories often “just have a few hours of parts” stored in inventory due to just-in-time supply chains, so new paperwork hurdles and tariffs would be devastating. Similarly, in the City, bankers report that almost every firm they know is making contingency plans, with varying degrees of irreversibility. There is growing scepticism that “passporting” rights for financial services products can be protected. “It looks increasingly like a hard Brexit is inevitable,” one leading UK commercial banker told journalists at a private lunch on Monday. “Unless they can find a way to avoid this, a transition phase might only delay the pain.”",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Iranian architects fight to save Gio Ponti villa from bulldozers", "content": "A villa in northern Tehran designed by Gio Ponti is to be demolished and replaced by a five-star hotel, prompting outrage over the fate of the only intact building by the Italian architect in the Middle East. Built in the early 1960s in the wealthy Niavaran district, the Villa Namazee was previously listed as a national treasure. But a court decision has given its current owner permission to delist it, paving the way for the construction of a 20-storey hotel. The prospect has touched a nerve among the country’s architects, prompting them to fight to save the building. Namazee was the last to be built of Ponti’s three famous villas, which greatly inspired a number of architects, including the late Iraqi-born British architect Zaha Hadid. The other two, Villa Planchart and Villa Arreaza, are in Caracas, Venezuela. Mohammad-Hassan Talebian, the deputy head of Iran’s cultural heritage, handcrafts and tourism organisation, told the Ilna news agency: “The building has been legally taken off the list, so the only way to save it is for the municipality to bring it under public ownership or exchange it for other properties.” Anonymous activists, named “the people’s committee to protect Tehran’s public houses”, have distributed an online leaflet underlying the significance of the villa and raising concerns about its imminent demolition. Facebook Twitter Pinterest There are many old trees with in Villa Namazee’s compound. Photograph: Hamed Khosravi/Tehran Projects Nashid Nabian, a Harvard graduate and Iranian scholar, said there was not enough sensitivity among Iranians to save the country’s contemporary heritage. “To go beyond our identity crisis, we always look back to our old history but our contemporary history is as significant,” she said. “The recent history creates a sense of belonging to the city and if you lose that, it would unravel and you would struggle to define yourself to the future or to define who you are now. If you lose your embedded history, you lose your contemporariness.” Nabian said the proposed hotel threatened the environment because the villa, which was commissioned by the businessman Shafi Namazee during the last shah’s rule, has many old trees within the compound’s walls. “It is a rare breathing space in the city with a lot of old trees and any construction will exacerbate the ecosystem crisis the area is facing, create huge traffic and lead to more pollution in the city,” she said.

Photograph: Hamed Khosravi/Tehran Projects The Iranian architect Parshia Qaregozloo, who was the curator of Iran’s pavilion at the 2016 Venice biennale, said there had been significant efforts to save Tehran’s landmarks in recent years, including the Panahi House, which was designed by the French architect Roland Dubrulle, but more attention was needed. “More than 300 works have been registered in Tehran and its vicinity in recent years but there are a lot of works that no one knows about and suddenly they are at the risk of being destroyed,” she said. An old house in Tehran’s Zaferanieh neighbourhood used by Queen Turan, the third wife of Reza Shah, the father of Iran’s last shah, was demolished this year to people’s dismay. Another house, frequented by the Iranian poet and film director Forough Farrokhzad, was reported to have been destroyed in November. Among other notable buildings neglected in the past decade are the Sabet Pasal house in Tehran, known as Iran’s palace of Versailles, and a house in Karaj which belonged to the last shah’s sister, Princess Shams Pahlavi, and was designed by American architect Frank Lloyd Wright. Ponti’s other work in the Middle East is the ministry of planning building in Baghdad which was partly damaged during the Iraq war. Unesco, along with the Polytechnic University of Milan, is involved in the conservation of the building which was constructed in 1958.

If it was anywhere else, it would have been protected.” Born in 1891, Ponti became an epitome of Italian fashion and design at its best in the 20th century. As well as being an architect, he also became well-known for designing ceramics and furniture in a career that spanned more than half a century. He died in 1979. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Italian architect and designer Gio Ponti pictured in the 1950s. Photograph: Mondadori/Mondadori via Getty Images Araghian said support for the Tehran villa had been heart-warming. “The fact that the Iranian society and Iranian architects are sensitive about this is positive by itself, it shows they are not indifferent. If it was 15 years ago, it would have been destroyed without much resistance,” she said. Ponti’s villa is among the most prominent buildings by a foreign architect. Last year, there were demonstrations in Tehran in protest at plans to change the facade of a bank designed by Jørn Utzon, the architect behind the Sydney Opera House. After the 1979 Islamic revolution, the Ponti villa, which was built for what the architect called “joie d’y vivre”, was first possessed by the government and used as a local registry office before being sold to Ahmad Abrishami, a representative of Nokia in Iran, who registered it as a national heritage building. It was sold to its present owner four years ago. Faryar Javaherian, an Iranian architect, documented the Villa Namazee after the revolution. “It is a master’s house,” she said. “It is one of the first projects of its kind featuring open plan with a suspended roof which also has a flooring that appears to be floating in the air. The ceramic used [by the artist Fausto Melotti] is very, very beautiful.” Javaherian pleaded for it to be saved. “If they want to build a hotel, they still can preserve the villa, it’s an added value, it’s not a distraction,” she said. “You have something good, why destroy it and replace it by something so awful?”",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Revealed: how Google enlisted members of US Congress it bankrolled to fight $6bn EU antitrust case", "content": "Google enlisted members of the US congress, whose election campaigns it had funded, to pressure the European Union to drop a €6bn antitrust case which threatens to decimate the US tech firm’s business in Europe. The coordinated effort by senators and members of the House of Representatives, as well as by a congressional committee, formed part of a sophisticated, multimillion-pound lobbying drive in Brussels, which Google has significantly ramped up as it fends off challenges to its dominance in Europe. How Google's antitrust headache began not from castle ramparts Read more An investigation by the Guardian into Google’s multifaceted lobbying campaign in Europe has uncovered fresh details of its activities and methods. Based on documents obtained under a freedom of information request and a series of interviews with EU officials, MEPs and Brussels lobbyists, the investigation has also found: • Google’s co-founder and CEO Larry Page met the then European commission chief privately in California in spring 2014 and raised the antitrust case despite being warned by EU officials that it would be inappropriate to do so. • Officials and lawmakers in Brussels say they have witnessed a significant expansion of Google lobbying efforts over the past 18 months as the company faces increased scrutiny of its business activities in Europe. • Google has employed several former EU officials as in-house lobbyists, and has funded European thinktanks and university research favourable to its position as part of its broader campaign. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Google co-founder Larry Page. Photograph: Bloomberg via Getty Images Capitol Hill’s aggressive intervention in Brussels came as the European parliament prepared to vote through a resolution in November 2014 that called on EU policymakers to consider breaking up Google’s online business into separate companies. Republican and Democratic senators and congressmen, many of whom have received significant campaign donations from Google totalling hundreds of thousands of dollars, leaned on parliament in a series of similar – and in some cases identical – letters sent to key MEPs. In another letter, the US House judiciary committee wrote to MEPs concerning the antitrust case against Google. The committee’s chairman, Bob Goodlatte, said the committee was “troubled to learn” some MEPs were “encouraging antitrust enforcement efforts that appear to be motivated by politics” that would ultimately undermine free markets. Google has consistently donated to Goodlatte’s election campaigns, while members on the judiciary committee that he chairs collectively received more than $200,000 (£133,000) from the company during the 2014 election cycle. Google declined to comment on the letters or its ties to the committee, including the fact one of its senior lawyers in Washington had joined the firm straight from the judiciary committee where he served as an antitrust counsel to its Republican members. A spokeswoman for the committee did not respond to the Guardian’s requests for comment. Scaling up Google’s expansion of its lobbying activities in Brussels has come in response to a growing number of threats to its business in the EU, where it dominates about 90% of the search market. It argues that its rivals lobby just as hard against it, if not harder. In April, a long-running antitrust investigation came to a head when the newly installed EU competition commissioner, Margrethe Vestager, formally accused Google of abusing its market dominance by systematically favouring its shopping price-comparison service. Facebook Twitter Pinterest The EU competition commissioner, Margrethe Vestager. Photograph: Francois Lenoir/Reuters Google, which could face a heavy fine of more than €6bn (£4.3bn) if found guilty, has rejected Vestager’s case as “wrong as a matter of fact, law and economics”. But this is only one of the battles Google is fighting in Brussels. The European commission has also launched a separate competition investigation into Google’s mobile operating system, Android, and indicated additional inquiries are being considered. This follows the symbolic blow MEPs dealt the US company late last year with the so-called “unbundling” resolution. Under pressure to defend itself, Google has opened its cheque book. Last year, the company spent more than twice as much on lobbying in Brussels than Apple, Facebook, Yahoo, Twitter and Uber combined. Yet Google is still being outspent by Microsoft, which some in Brussels suspect is backing a vocal anti-Google lobby in Brussels. Microsoft declined to comment. Official transparency data shows Google has increased its annual lobbying spending from €600,000 in 2011 to almost €4m last year. In addition to its team of in-house lobbyists – many of whom have come from jobs in the commission or the European parliament – the company has employed eight European lobbying firms. Google lobbying of Brussels graphic In October 2014, senior Google executives acknowledged in a letter to a senior commission official, Günther Oettinger, the Silicon Valley company needed to “engage more deeply in Europe, especially in Brussels”. This strategy is borne out by records of meetings with the commission. Between December 2014 and June 2015, Google held more high-level meetings with commission officials than any other company. Google sympathisers accept it is lobbying hard, but suggest no company would sit back and not ensure its side of the story is being heard when so much is at stake, especially when claimants in the antitrust case have formed well-funded lobby groups to fight the firm. One such group, ICOMP, receives funding from numerous complainants in the antitrust case, including Microsoft, and is closely associated with Burson-Marsteller, a large public relations firm previously paid by Facebook to plant negative stories about Google. Latest data shows ICOMP spent €400,000 on lobbying in Brussels between 2013-14. It does not disclose how much it spent on legal costs incurred in connection with the case against Google. One senior EU official speaking on condition of anonymity said Google’s lobbying in Brussels stood out because of the intricate, often subtle yet powerful mechanisms it employs. “What is striking is the comprehensive and strategic approach they have. They are not only doing PR but they are doing everything. They are using proxies, which is much more powerful than just the usual stuff,” he told the Guardian. For instance, as part of its broader public affairs programme, Google has paid for academic research supportive of its public policy objectives, through its funding of work at prestigious European universities and leading Brussels thinktanks, including the Centre for European Policy Studies (CEPS) and the Bruegel Institute. A spokesman for the US tech firm said European politicians had “many questions for Google and about the internet”. To help answer those questions, he added, Google sometimes commissioned independent research, but always asked the academics to disclose funding they received from the company. Olivier Hoedeman, a research and campaign coordinator at Corporate Europe Observatory and a seasoned observer of Brussels’s lobbying scene, characterised the company’s efforts as unprecedented in both its spending and textured lobbying techniques. “Google has in an unprecedented manner stepped up their Brussels lobbying efforts during the last few years, massively increasing their spending on lobbying and on other activities in a very comprehensive and multifaceted lobbying campaign aimed at influencing the European commission’s decisions,” he said. Among MEPs, this became particularly apparent in November last year when the European parliament voted yes to the motion to break up Google’s search business from its advertising and other businesses. “At the time of the November parliamentary session, Google’s lobby activity clearly stepped up in a way that we have never seen before,” said Ramon Tremosa, a Spanish MEP from Catalonia involved in putting forward the unbundling resolution. Tremosa said that during the week of the vote Google’s Brussels-based lobbyists were joined by its public affairs officers for each of the 28 EU-member states in filling the corridors of parliament. According to Jacques Lafitte, a veteran lobbyist at Avisa Partners whose clients include a complainant in the antitrust case, Google’s lobbying in Brussels is unrivalled. “Before Google, the most sophisticated company in terms of political influence was Goldman Sachs. But Google beats them any day because contrary to Goldman they don’t just focus on the top,” Lafitte said. “Google makes its influence felt absolutely everywhere.” High-level interventions Google’s most senior executives have also played their part in the lobbying drive. In May 2014, with less than six months to persuade the commission to abandon the antitrust action before a change in leadership at Europe’s executive arm, Google co-founder Larry Page met the then commission president, José Manuel Barroso, at the company’s headquarters in Mountain View, California. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Former European commission president José Manuel Barroso. Photograph: Christian Lutz/AP Before the private meeting, Barroso’s staff warned Page that under no circumstances should he discuss the antitrust investigation with the commission president. But Page was running out of time. A letter sent by Google’s executive chairman, Eric Schmidt, to Barroso months later shows the case was discussed. Page told Barroso Google could implement a new set of commitments designed to allay fears about European rivals being unable to compete with it. For an hour, the commission president sat and listened. “We loved having you in Mountain View and I enjoyed our discussion tremendously,” Page later wrote to Barroso. “Next time you’re in the Valley please come and visit again.” The timing of the meeting, according to Hoederman, was “very awkward” as the European commission was weighing the antitrust case against the company. Facebook Twitter Pinterest The entrance to Google’s headquarters in Mountain View, California. Photograph: John G Mabanglo/EPA “A visit of this kind at such a sensitive time muddies the waters and shows poor judgment by Barroso,” he said. “It would have been understandable if the EU’s competition policy officials felt that Barroso’s visit risked undermining their integrity of the investigation.” Julia Reda, a Green MEP from Germany, noted: “This is not the first time there have been reports of Google trying to influence the outcome of the commission’s antitrust investigation through high-level interventions. “As it is difficult to tell what is going on behind closed doors, I am not in a position to judge whether the communication between the commission and Google during this competition inquiry has been atypical, though it certainly raises questions.” A spokesman for the commission defended its dealings with Google. “In line with its normal procedures, the commission’s antitrust investigation into Google’s business practices has been handled in an open and transparent way,” he said. In September 2014, with the clocking ticking and less than a month before Barroso stepped down, Schmidt joined in the lobbying of Barroso, having previously left the task to Google’s chief in-house lobbyists in Brussels. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Google’s executive chairman, Eric Schmidt addresses the 9th Global Competitiveness Forum earlier this year. Photograph: Fayez Nureldine/AFP/Getty Images In a last-ditch attempt to change the course of the antitrust case, Schmidt asked Barroso to lean on his commissioners to approve the proposed settlement. Calling it a “crucial stage in the process”, Schmidt warned in pointed language that a failure to approve the settlement would undermine the commission’s credibility and result in “drawn-out litigation”. Less than a week later, the commission reopened the long-running antitrust investigation, dealing Google a major setback. In a surprise move, it rejected Google’s third settlement offer following “very, very negative” responses from complainants to the proposed settlement. Trouble ahead? After changes in leadership at the European commission in November 2014, Google’s lobbyists in Brussels have become increasingly frustrated. Documents show the company’s repeated attempts to set up meetings with senior commission officials including the president, Jean-Claude Juncker, have thus far been unsuccessful. In one instance, Google requested a meeting with a senior adviser to Juncker shortly after the commission formally issued its antitrust case. However, her assistant bluntly declined the request and directed them to the new competition commissioner, Vestager. There is a feeling among some EU officials that Google may have underestimated the strict legal procedures that dictate how antitrust cases progress in Europe. However, others say the US firm’s mistake has more to do with underestimating the influence of an “anti-Google lobby”, backed by the likes of Microsoft and German media empire Axel Springer. In the US, Google saw off a potentially damaging antitrust investigation by the Federal Trade Commission, which dropped its case in early 2013. But the landscape in Brussels differs from that in Washington, where Google enjoys more clout and personal connections with the highest levels of government. John Simpson, of Consumer Watchdog in the US, believes Google has been successful at positioning itself in and around the corridors of power in Washington. “They’re masters at it and it’s worked very, very well for them,” he said. But he claims Europe’s acceptance of Google’s size, power and dominance is less than what it is in the US. “I think there may be a failure to understand the European perspective on certain issues,” he said, “I don’t think that they at the core understand how privacy is viewed as a fundamental right in Europe.” Alarmingly for Google, its investors are beginning to wake up to the trouble it faces in Brussels. Scott Kessler, an equity analyst at S&P Capital IQ who watches Google closely, said many investors had become apathetic about the charges levelled against the company, but the mood is beginning to change. “Google have been facing these issues in Europe for a number of years and some people believe that now is the time that they will have to account for some of these actions in some way,” he said. Once again the clock is ticking for Google. Vestager is treating her investigations as a high priority and has indicated EU regulators will actively pursue its new parent company, Alphabet, on multiple fronts.",diasaster:0},

This comes, after all, more than a year after the US rallied more than 60 countries in a “global” effort to “degrade and defeat” the jihadi insurgency. Although there is some overlap between these two coalitions, Saudi has stressed the “Islamic” character of the alliance it purports to lead – ranging from Mauritania and Chad to Pakistan and Malaysia – with a “joint operational centre” located in Riyadh. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Ensaf Haidar, wife of sajailed Saudi blogger Raif Badawi, accepts the Sakharov prize on his behalf, 16 December 2015. Photograph: Patrick Seeger/EPA How this new coalition will contribute to pushing Isis out of its heartland in Raqqa remains to be seen. What can it achieve militarily that the current US-led coalition cannot? Moreover, doubts about Saudi Arabia’s motives are legitimate: the kingdom may well be intent chiefly on salvaging its international image, severely dented by a dismal human rights record and decades of propounding a radical Sunni ideology that arguably reaches its twisted apogee in Isis itself. It may be no coincidence that the announcement came the day before Saudi blogger Raif Badawi, who has been sentenced to prison and flogging for criticising religious figures, was awarded the European Sakharov prize for freedom of thought. Some will worry that the fight against Isis is to be fronted by a nation that itself beheads at home, and exports dubious ideas abroad, even if Saudi Arabia does not kill and maim on European streets in the way that Isis does. Others will fear that this move only entrenches a sectarian proxy war fought by Saudis and Iranians on Syrian soil. And yet, for all the concerns, the pragmatic reality is that this is a significant development. In the eyes of predominantly Sunni countries, Saudi involvement may consolidate the legitimacy of the anti-Isis fight. It denies the jihadis’ claims to be the Sunnis’ sole defender. The Saudi initiative does not answer the key question about what ground troops will be available. But the Saudi foreign minister, Adel al-Jubeir, has said “nothing is off the table”. If words are matched with deeds, the new Saudi-led alliance could lend some missing shape to a regionally rooted strategy. Defeating Isis cannot, after all, be a solely western effort. It must involve all states and societies – not least because its most numerous victims are Muslim.",diasaster:0},

It is a figure that far outstrips the amount given in international aid by rich countries. Healthcare, schools and other key public services are being starved of resources.

We anticipate future successes, then price them into the challenges of today. Take the recent Paris climate summit, a commitment to reducing global warning to “well below 2C”. As Richard Martin writes in the MIT Technology Review, this figure relies on emerging technologies that are barely proven. Indeed, “barring a major technological advance that is not currently foreseeable, those targets are unreachable”. Even so, we have already anticipated them in cheering the 2C figure. We have placed our faith in something called progress, in the untestable belief that things will always get better. There is a new form of climate denialism to look out for – so don't celebrate yet | Naomi Oreskes Read more We do the same with economics. Here progress is called growth. Governments borrow money in the anticipation that the future pie will have grown enough to pay back what has been borrowed, with leftovers. It is not quite true, as David Attenborough has said, that only “madmen and economists” believe in infinite growth. When it comes to the future, capitalism and technology are bosom pals, both assuming that the passage of time, despite the occasional bump, inevitably points us in the direction of continual advance. But what if economic growth is the source of our worsening environmental problem? What if all this ever-increasing activity is precisely what leads us to burn more fuel, thus further polluting the planet. Oh, let’s not worry too much, the purveyors of progress assure us, the future will sort it out. That’s about as reassuring as putting all our trash in the Tardis and emptying it out over our great-grandchildren. Back in 1980, the biologist Barry Commoner ran for president against Ronald Reagan. Next to Reagan’s folksy Christian/capitalist optimism, Commoner didn’t stand a chance. A leftwing humanist, he was one of the first to warn about the environmental dangers of our belief in progress. His celebrated four laws of ecology encapsulated the belief that we live on a finite, limited planet: 1 Everything is connected to everything else; 2 Everything must go somewhere; 3 Nature knows best; 4 There is no such thing as a free lunch. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Michael Huesemann, author of Techno Fix: Why Technology Won’t Save Us or the Environment, invokes Barry Commoner’s four laws of ecology - video Looking at the technological assumptions behind the Paris agreement from the perspective of these laws, it’s clear there is a problem. For if everything is connected, then a technological intervention in one area may have unintended consequences somewhere else. And if everything must go somewhere, then capturing carbon and pumping it into the ground (or wherever) is just kicking the can down the road. “Nature knows best” is not some romantic fancy – it asserts that the balance of nature has been forged by millions of years of evolution, nature’s own R&D department – and that we tinker with this balance at our peril. But it’s that free lunch that lures us in. And that’s what progress and growth provide – an alibi for excess. Indeed, they turn excess into a virtue, redescribing our overblown appetites as the engine of greater future prosperity. Growth is the philosopher’s stone that offers to turn all things into gold. But, like all belief in magic – ie the belief in a free lunch – it points to a fall. That’s a bit rich, coming from a religious man, I hear the sceptics shout. To which I’d reply that if we think the temptation to believe in magic is something that died with popular religion, then it’s scepticism that has died. Indeed, the belief in progress uncritically assumes one of the basic features of a Christian worldview – that time’s arrow always points towards some future paradise. Hegel’s dialectic did much the same. “Things can only get better,” sang the pop group D:Ream, with that arch progress-monger Prof Brian Cox on keyboards. In the end, this very contemporary faith can’t be disproved by the present. We’ll just have to see how things turn out. As some Christians say, there will be an eschatological verification – or not.

On a monthly basis, the average price of a UK home edged up 0.2%, to £205,240, following a 0.8% rise in December. Robert Gardner, Nationwide’s chief economist, said there were indications the housing market would soften in 2017, as household budgets come under pressure from higher consumer inflation at a time of weaker jobs and wage growth. UK housing market falters as estate agents become less optimistic Read more “The outlook for the housing market remains clouded, reflecting the uncertainty surrounding economic prospects more broadly,” Gardner said. “On the one hand, there are grounds for optimism. The economy has remained far stronger than expected in the wake of the Brexit vote. However, there are tentative signs that conditions may be about to soften. “The economy is likely to slow through 2017 as the squeeze on household budgets intensifies and heightened uncertainty weighs on business investment and hiring.” Nationwide predicts that growth in house prices will more than halve in 2017 to 2% from 4.5% in 2016. Howard Archer, the chief UK economist at IHS Markit, said conditions for house buyers were likely to deteriorate progressively during 2017. Inflation has already started to rise as the impact of the sharp fall in the value of the pound since the EU referendum feeds through to prices. A weaker pound makes imports from abroad more expensive.

Looking back at trends over the last 60 years, Nationwide said the biggest gains in real house prices – comparing how much faster house prices have increased compared with goods and services more generally – were made in the 2000s. “These increases were spurred by a combination of strong and stable economic growth, a structural decline in interest rates and the further liberalisation of the financial system,” Gardner said. “In the decades ahead, real house price trends will continue to depend crucially on developments in the wider economy, though there is an even greater degree of uncertainty around this than usual.”",diasaster:0},

Critics of the ordinance, introduced by a government that won parliamentary elections in December, say it could reverse an anti-corruption fight in Romania that has drawn widespread praise internationally. Additional laws could be issued in the coming days, further eroding ministers’ accountability, according to the government’s opponents. In a post on Facebook, the Romanian president, Klaus Iohannis, who has opposed the emergency ordinance and who last month joined protesters on the streets, wrote: “Today is a day of mourning for the rule of law.” News of the ordinance passing broke at about 10pm local time, and by midnight local media estimated that 12,000 people were demonstrating in Bucharest and 10,000 in other cities across the country, despite freezing temperatures. There were shouts of “Thieves” and “You won’t get away with it.” “I don’t normally protest but I just felt such a sense of rage,” said Alexandra Boeriu, a 35-year-old NGO worker who protested outside the main government building in Bucharest. “I was young, but I did live through communism and I know what this is.

If this is the kind of procedure they do, we wonder what’s next. It looks like anything is possible.” Protests have been held for the past two Sundays over the government’s plans, which would also grant amnesty to those sentenced to jail terms shorter than five years in relation to certain crimes and halve prison terms for those with young children, pregnant women, or those over 60. The EU has weighed in on the controversy, warning the government not to backtrack on anti-graft measures. “The fight against corruption needs to be advanced, not undone,” European commission head Jean-Claude Juncker and his deputy, Frans Timmermans, said in a joint statement. “We are following the latest developments in Romania with great concern.” Government officials have suggested the laws were aimed at easing overcrowded conditions in prisons, but few observers are convinced, and many believe the real purpose is to help convicted politicians, or those who are now under investigation, escape justice. Romania, an enthusiastic EU member for a decade and a major recipient of EU funds, remains one of Europe’s most corrupt countries: a report by the IPP thinktank released late last year found that of the 588 MPs elected in previous elections in 2012, 89 – or 15% – were either under investigation for graft, had already been convicted, or chose to step down for other positions. Hundreds of officials have been imprisoned in recent years, and more than 2,000 files are under investigation in relation to abuse of office, according to prosecutors. “With this government I feel insecure and the new law which favours corruption is a huge offence and an attack on us, the regular people,” said Alberto Grosescu, a 29-year-old photographer who took to the streets on Tuesday night immediately after the ordinance was announced. Grosescu predicts that many more people will come out to protest. “I’m pretty sure that tonight there is going to be over 100,000 people in Bucharest, maybe over 200,000 across the whole country,” he said. Those protesting hope that their actions could still lead to change. “They have to, I don’t think politicians can ignore so many people, but we have to stand up and continue to stand up,” said Boeriu.

Gorsuch’s disposition on abortion rights cases may be suggested in a line from a book he wrote about euthanasia, the subject of his doctoral studies at Oxford University. “To act intentionally against life is to suggest that its value rests only on its transient instrumental usefulness for other ends,” Gorsuch wrote. Nancy Northup, president and CEO of the Center for Reproductive Rights, said the onus was on the nominee to explain his position on the issue. “Given president Trump’s promise to appoint a supreme court justice that would seek to overturn Roe v Wade, we need to know whether Judge Gorsuch would do just that,” Northup said. The looming issues awaiting Donald Trump's supreme court nominee Read more “Our constitution guarantees a woman’s right to safe, legal abortion. Any effort to gut those protections would harm the rights and health of women for generations to come.” But beyond any single issue Gorsuch has articulated a judicial philosophy that emphasizes the primacy of the constitution and prizes the text of laws, while warning against judicial forays that might be mistaken for an attempt to shape or direct legislation. “Congress could have written the law differently than it did, and it is always free to rewrite the law when it wishes,” Gorsuch wrote in a ruling that argued for a new hearing for a felon convicted of firearm possession. “But in our legal order it is the role of the courts to apply the law as it is written, not some different law Congress might have written in the past or might write in the future.” In some ways Gorsuch seems likely to please social conservatives. He has repeatedly upheld claims of a religious exemption where the law would compel an individual to violate a personal spiritual belief. While the supreme court declined to consider one such “religious liberty” case in 2016, in which a family-owned pharmacy objected to a state regulation forcing it to sell emergency contraceptives, future cases in the area seem likely. In Hobby Lobby Stores Inc v Sebelius, Gorsuch argued that a retail store owner need not comply with a provision in Barack Obama’s health care law requiring employers to provide health insurance covering oral contraceptives. In his opinion Gorsuch gave wide berth to the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which asserts the religious liberty claim and which Gorsuch called a “super-statute”. Hannah Smith, a lawyer at the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, which represented Hobby Lobby in the case, praised the judge’s ruling. “That opinion is an example that he is a clear thinker, a clear writer on really complicated religious liberty issues,” Smith told the Guardian. “They were faced with a Hobson’s choice, to choose to abide by their religion or saving their business. I think he’s someone who would stand up for the religious liberty for all.” Elsewhere Gorsuch has ruled sympathetically in cases involving the erection of Ten Commandments monuments in public spaces and ruled against capital punishment defendants seeking relief from their sentences. In the integrity of his adherence to the principal of judicial restraint, as well as in the pithy eloquence – if he lacks a certain acerbity – of his opinions, Gorsuch is often compared favorably with the justice he would replace, Antonin Scalia, who died in February 2016. “His writing style has often been compared to Justice Scalia’s,” Severino said. “It’s very incisive, very clear and logical, but also very entertaining, and of course that was a hallmark of Justice Scalia’s own writing style.” Gorsuch spoke about Scalia’s death in an April 2016 speech at Case Western University. “I was taking a breather in the middle of a ski run with little on my mind but the next mogul field when my phone rang with the news,” Gorsuch said. “I immediately lost what breath I had left, and I am not embarrassed to admit that I couldn’t see the rest of the way down the mountain for the tears. He really was a lion of the law: docile in private life but a ferocious fighter when at work, with a roar that could echo for miles.” Gorsuch’s biggest difference with Scalia comes in the field of administrative law, an area that is sleepy for most laypeople but determines the scope of much government action. The Trump nominee has been a critic of “Chevron deference,” a doctrine that gives administrative agencies significant latitude with how they interpret federal statutes. His views, which are shared by a number of conservative legal scholars, would significantly weaken the federal government and allow the courts to override agency actions on issues ranging from immigration to health care to the environment. But several former colleagues of Gorsuch’s from across the ideological spectrum have called for Gorsuch’s confirmation, saying his temperament is distinctly different from Scalia. “Scalia’s writing seemed dismissive to the claims of gay rights,” said Melissa Hart, professor at the University of Colorado Law School who worked with Gorsuch. “Everything I know about Neil Gorsuch as a person leads me to believe he would not be dismissive of anyone’s claims, regardless of how he rules. I’m not saying I think he will rule in favor of LGBT rights but I don’t think he will be dismissive of anyone’s claims.” Hart said she believes Gorsuch is “more than qualified to be on the supreme court”, echoing an op-ed in the New York Times by Neal Katyal, a former acting solicitor general under Barack Obama, that called for liberals to back Gorsuch. “I understand the political reasons for wanting to block the nomination,” Hart said, “but I don’t think there’s a principled reason to reject Neil Gorsuch as a jurist.” Neil McGill Gorsuch was born on 29 August 1967 and grew up in Denver, Colorado. His family moved to Washington, DC, after Ronald Reagan nominated his mother, Anne Gorsuch Burford, to head the Environmental Protection Agency. Gorsuch attended Georgetown preparatory school, Columbia University, Harvard Law school and Oxford University, where he enrolled on a Marshall scholarship and earned a doctorate. He fits the mold of every sitting justice on the US supreme court in educational pedigree: they all went to Harvard or Yale for law school. Post-graduation, Gorsuch worked for a decade representing mostly corporate clients at the Washington law firm of Kellogg Huber Hansen Todd Evans & Figel. But Mark Hansen, the nominee’s former boss at the firm, told the Denver Post that Gorsuch was a “regular person”. “He acts and relates well to all people, and he did the same sort of thing in trial, where he was very good at making connections with jurors,” Hansen said. “He’s a regular person. It’s part of being a Westerner.” At Oxford, Gorsuch met his future wife, Louise Gorsuch, a UK citizen. With their two teenage daughters they lives outside Boulder, Colorado, where Gorsuch indulges hobbies including fly-fishing, hiking and rowing. After his 2005 essay subtly celebrating the re-election of George W Bush, Gorsuch got good news from the administration. Gorsuch was to be appointed to the 10th circuit appeals court, which covers all or part of Colorado, Kansas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Utah and Wyoming. In 2006, when it came time for the Senate to review his nomination, Gorsuch was confirmed in the most expeditious way possible, by a voice vote and encountering no objection. This time may be different. With reporting by Ben Jacobs",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"The Guardian view on Brexit: more haste, less speed", "content": "In the end, 47 Labour MPs decided to vote against the bill triggering article 50. Two more frontbenchers, Dawn Butler and Rachel Maskell, resigned in order to vote against Jeremy Corbyn’s ill-advised three-line whip. Many MPs, in two days of often deeply felt debate, said they felt bound to honour their voters’ wishes despite their belief that leaving the EU will be a disaster for the economy, and regardless of the majority for remain among people who would normally vote Labour. The difficulty of this vote for the party was etched on the face of the shadow Brexit secretary, Sir Keir Starmer, as he wove his way through the mess of conflicting ambitions that constitute current party policy. We would rather that the party had voted with its heart than, as it perhaps did, with an eye on its electoral prospects in leave areas like Stoke and Copeland. We would say the same about the Conservative remainers too. But Labour’s equivocations on Europe long predated the vote and will continue long after. Yet unless it can find a stronger position to unite around on such a central issue, Labour will struggle to be a credible party of opposition. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Brexit debate: the best Commons speeches, from Ken Clarke to Nick Clegg But Labour’s dismal performance is not the real scandal of Wednesday’s vote, and those who pretend it is are playing the leavers’ game. The real scandal is that, with the distinguished exception of Ken Clarke, the Tory party’s many remainers bent the knee. As a result, the government had an overwhelming majority on the second reading of the bill to trigger article 50. Its failure to publish a white paper before the debate went unpunished. This disregard for the most basic of requirements for a decision of such consequence must not be allowed to be a taste of things to come. It is all the more alarming that, as late as Tuesday, it seems no draft had been circulated: the home secretary, a member of the small group of senior ministers who sit on the cabinet committee on Brexit, told MPs she had not seen it. Yet, even as the potentially grim consequences of Brexit become clearer, Theresa May’s timetable for the process of departure remains on track. It is not all over, however. Everything is still possible. Now the prime minister must come clean about the choices that lie ahead, and their consequences – and she must convey to the whole of Britain the scale of the task ahead. Even without a white paper, it is clear that she puts controlling borders and repatriating law at the head of her list of priorities. It is also clear, as George Osborne told the Commons, that at the head of the EU’s list is the integrity of the union of the remaining 27 members. Those governing ideas will, unavoidably, make many of the other ambitions that Mrs May set out in her speech a fortnight ago extremely challenging. The negotiations will be just that – negotiations that must be conducted with the intention of reaching an agreement that is acceptable for both sides. It is an irony that Mrs May will not appreciate that the European court of justice from which she so ardently wishes to escape is highly likely to be called in to adjudicate on aspects of the final deal, as its president Koen Lenaerts points out. Mrs May talks ominously about no deal being better than a bad deal, and claims to be prepared to crash out on World Trade Organisation terms. This is a terrible strategy. As the SNP’s Westminster leader, Angus Robertson, put it at prime minister’s questions, Mrs May has made one successful foreign trip in the past week. That was her trip to Dublin, where she and the Irish taoiseach, Enda Kenny, discussed how best to preserve the free trade area and protect the Northern Ireland peace process. She would do well to take the lesson about the value of negotiations conducted in good faith and a spirit of cooperation. A hard Brexit would be ruinous. Every MP should spend the coming week consulting their local businesses on the impact of WTO terms, and calculate their likely impact on jobs and prices. The referendum itself has been a catastrophe. But if Mrs May continues to treat leaving the EU as if it can be achieved in a couple of years of hard work, she is doing the voters a grave disservice. She knows the cost of making pledges on immigration that are unachievable. Suggesting that Brexit can be done and dusted before the next election is a deceit on a monstrous scale. As Sir Ivan Rogers, the former UK ambassador to the EU, told MPs on the Brexit committee on Wednesday morning, the task ahead was “humongous”. It would, unavoidably, be bloody. This will be a long game, and the government must say so.",diasaster:0},

{ "title":"Argos Christmas deliveries face delays after drivers vote to strike", "content": "Argos shoppers could face delays to deliveries of their Christmas presents after drivers at its main distribution centre in Staffordshire voted to strike for three days from 20 December. It comes after Post Office workers voted to stage five days of strikes in the run-up to Christmas in a long-running dispute over jobs and pensions. December strikes do not signify new 'winter of discontent' Read more The 35 Argos drivers, who all work on big lorries taking goods from the catalogue shop’s central warehouse run by logistics firm Wincanton to regional centres from where they are sent out to stores, are protesting over holiday pay. Unite, the union acting for the workers based at the depot near Burton upon Trent, said each driver was owed about £700 in holiday pay dating back at least two years. The dispute comes after it was ruled that overtime and additional shift payments should be taken into account when assessing holiday pay. Unite said a strike would cause “havoc and mayhem” to deliveries in the crucial days running up to Christmas. Its regional officer, Rick Coyle, said the action was a last resort after years of talks. “The drivers have patiently tried to resolve this matter for over two years. Now they would like the money they are owed in time for Christmas, which is not unreasonable. “It is very difficult to understand why Wincanton has allowed this saga to get out of hand because this strike by our members will cause havoc and mayhem to deliveries to Argos shops in the run-up to Christmas,” he said. “There will be a lot of very unhappy Argos customers, if they don’t receive the iPhones, TVs and white goods that they have ordered as presents for relatives this Christmas.” Argos, which was taken over by supermarket group Sainsbury’s earlier this year, said: “We would encourage both sides to keep talking with the aim of coming to a swift resolution. We also have contingency plans in place and can reassure customers we’re working hard to ensure this will not impact our deliveries this Christmas.” The Burton on Trent facility handles nearly 2m items a week in the run-up to Christmas, with about 120 trailer loads of goods a day heading out to regional distribution centres and on to Argos’s 800-plus stores.

{ "title":"Met police receive 106 allegations of sexual abuse at football clubs", "content": "Metropolitan police officers are investigating 106 separate allegations of historical sexual abuse at football clubs in London. Britain’s biggest police force said the allegations were linked to individuals at 32 named clubs or teams in London, including four in the Premier League. Two allegations have been made against Championship clubs, three against clubs in Leagues One and Two and 21 other clubs including non-league or non-professional or amateur teams were involved, the Met said. The update from Scotland Yard comes nearly four weeks after the former Crewe defender Andy Woodward waived his right to anonymity to tell the Guardian that he had been a victim of sexual abuse. DCS Ivan Balhatchet, of the Met’s sexual offence, exploitation and child abuse command, said: “The Met take all allegations seriously, and specialist officers will work through the information passed to them. “The number of referrals, pieces of information and allegations will change. Officers will continue to work through the information that has been reported.” The Met refused to name the clubs involved or the number of allegations against each club. Last week, police chiefs confirmed 83 potential suspects had been identified in connection with allegations of historical child sexual abuse in football. After Woodward spoke out, former Crewe player Steve Walters alleged he was abused, also in an interview with the Guardian. Other players, including Paul Stewart and David White, then came forward to the Guardian and other media. The Guardian subsequently reported that an unnamed former Newcastle United player had contacted police with allegations against coach George Ormond, who was jailed for six years in 2002 for numerous assaults over 24 years. The Football Association appointed Kate Gallafent QC at the end of November to help with its internal review of historical child sexual abuse allegations. Twenty-one police forces have launched investigations into the claims. Meanwhile, the Scottish Football Association has announced an independent review into allegations of child sex abuse within the sport. In a statement released late on Tuesday afternoon, the SFA said Scottish football was “a safe and enjoyable environment for children”, but added that it was taking “initial steps towards establishing an appropriate scope and terms of reference for an independent review”. “It is imperative that we take the necessary time and guidance to ensure this review complements the work of Police Scotland and focuses on processes and procedures in place both currently and historically in Scottish football,” the SFA said. Police Scotland is currently investigating a series of allegations of historical sexual abuse at football clubs in Scotland. Partick Thistle admitted firing one of their employees in 1992 over abuse claims. That employee also worked for Motherwell, who are holding their own investigation. A former youth coach for Celtic, Hibernian and Falkirk was charged last Wednesday with a child sex offence in Northern Ireland and has been remanded in custody.

{ "title":"Stanley Reynolds obituary", "content": "In 1986 the journalist and critic Stanley Reynolds, who has died aged 82, interviewed JP Donleavy, “the literary dandy and noted public house fist-fighter”. He backed up the two epithets with an account of a brawl on the Isle of Man, in which Donleavy took on six Irishmen and a Roman Catholic bishop, all of whom had come to rescue the young Edna O’Brien from an older lover, Ernest Gebler, “and bring the runaway Edna back to the bosom of her family, and a sin-free life back in Erin, green gem of the silver sea”. In the end, Edna stayed with her lover (they married in 1954), the assailants limped off, and Donleavy “counted six teeth on the sun-baked terrace overlooking the sea, counted his own incisors, canines, molars and gnashers and saw that none of the six were his”. It was reportage, but Stan might have been writing about himself: an American abroad, a hard drinker, an occasional fighter and womaniser, and of course a literary dandy. Almost every column by Stan was an event: so too were his rare appearances at the Guardian’s London offices. He would occasionally appear dressed in denim, as if channelling the late Jack Kerouac; mostly he seemed an unlikely Lord Peter Wimsey figure, in the tweeds of the English gentry. In the hard-drinking world of bygone daily journalism he seemed to drink harder than most, and for a man who remained resolutely an American expatriate, he talked a lot about cricket. He wrote, with perception and feeling, about literature, American, British and Russian; he wrote about theatre, television and sport; he argued with a charming mixture of aggression and diffidence; and he could be relied upon to deliver the unexpected. In 1974, at the height of the cold war, as the Soviet Union exiled the Nobel laureate and dissident author Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn – then a hero in the west – Stan was the first to point out that wishy-washy western liberals were going to find him uncomfortable: “Solzhenitsyn, I am afraid, is not one of us. That is to say he is not a liberal. I don’t know what exactly he is, but whatever it is, it is most peculiar.” He also that same year, in a lurid account of a cricket tour of the south of England by the Liverpool cricket club, happily subverted the myth of the north. The southerner “sees us coming from tin shacks in our whitewashed pit boots, bellies full of thick-seamed tripe. “Nothing could be further from the truth. Our cricket clubs are like our working men’s clubs, our Labour and Conservative clubs, all wall-to-wall and chrome, decor-ed up to the elbows and practically neon-lit. Old Trafford is a giant of a place, 20 bars, restaurants, fruit machines … Sometimes the cricket looks like an afterthought.” Stan was born in Holyoke, Massachusetts, which boasts, after New York, the largest St Patrick’s Day parade in the US. His father was Ambrose Harrington Reynolds, a sales manager for RJ Reynolds Tobacco, the firm that made Camel cigarettes, and his mother Irene Ducharme, a French Canadian. His military service was with the US army’s First Infantry Division, nicknamed the “Big Red One”, and he ended as Acting Sergeant Reynolds, a qualified marksman who once inadvertently invaded Canada – a mistake over grid references – but who never served overseas. He remained a US citizen all his life, and a Democrat. His home town remained important to him. He became a reporter for the Holyoke Transcript-Telegram and then the Providence Journal in Rhode Island, but while still in Holyoke he met the Liverpudlian Gillian Morton, a student from St Anne’s College, Oxford, who was completing a year at Mount Holyoke College. They married in 1958 and moved to Britain: she became the Guardian’s radio critic before joining the Daily Telegraph and staying for 40 years. He worked among other outlets for Reuters news agency and then in the 1960s joined the Guardian, as critic, columnist and feature writer. His first novel, the satire Better Dead than Red, was published in 1964 in the UK and North America, and translated into German and Italian. Anthony Burgess called it “savagely funny” and Malcolm Bradbury described it as “up there with Dr Strangelove”. He and Gillian settled in Liverpool. He wrote the lyrics for a Liverpool Everyman production of George Bernard Shaw’s Androcles and the Lion as a musical, and the book and lyrics for Desolation Angel, a musical tribute to Kerouac, performed at the Everyman and at the King’s Head in London. Facebook Twitter Pinterest The Good and the Quick, the documentary that Stanley Reynolds made for the BBC series Great Little Railways, first shown in 1983 After turning freelance, he continued to write for the Guardian as well as the Times. In 1982 he made a BBC documentary for a series called Great Little Railways, an account of a trip through the Andes in Ecuador. He had written for the humorous magazine Punch, and in 1980 became its literary editor. He wrote an arts diary for the newspaper the European and contributed to a short-lived cricket magazine backed by the then giant of the pitch, Imran Khan. And, when he could, he played – for a while he was a fast bowler for a local Pakistani side called Pak Mersey. His marriage to Gillian came to an end in 1975, and for some years Stan continued to care for his young sons, to live riotously, and to write memorably about doing both. His son Alexander remembers the parties at their Liverpool home and “routinely stepping over drunk, passed-out corpses on the way to school in the morning”. He also remembers the time the actor Bill Nighy “left the house with dad’s prized Moss Bros overcoat”. Gillian later gained custody of their sons. Stan gave up drinking in 1984, and smoking in 2003. He and Jane McLoughlin, a former editor of the Guardian women’s page, moved to west Somerset, near the Quantock Hills, in 1991, and married in 2004. Death Dyed Blonde (2008) was followed by more crime novels, set in a New England town very like Holyoke: “I wanted to create a world which was a bit of Eden except for the odd corpse showing up,” he wrote. He also wrote: “I supported three sons and several bartenders writing this sort of stuff I now give away free in these blogs.” In 2003, he had a heart attack, with 127 cardiac arrests in one episode. “Not a record, the doctor said, but in the top 10,” Jane reported. Though more or less immobilised, he continued to write for the Guardian, with obituaries of the comic novelist Tom Sharpe, the crime writers Ruth Rendell and PD James, and George MacDonald Fraser, begetter of the Flashman novels. Stan is survived by Jane and his sons, Ambrose, Alexander and Abel, from his marriage to Gillian. • Stanley Ambrose Reynolds, journalist and author, born 27 November 1934; died 28 November 2016",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"People smuggler behind 700 deaths at sea is convicted in Italy", "content": "A Tunisian migrant-smuggler behind the worst maritime disaster in the Mediterranean in recent history has been found guilty of manslaughter by an Italian court and faces 18 years in jail. About 700 people, including young children, were killed in April 2015 after Mohammed Ali Malek slammed an overcrowded fishing boat into a Portuguese merchant ship that was attempting a rescue of the passengers. The fishing boat capsized in the dark of night. Hundreds of people who were trapped in its hull were killed and dozens of others drowned in the open sea. Only 28 people, including Malek, who was 27 at the time and was quickly identified as the boat’s skipper, survived the disaster. Malek’s second in command, a Syrian named Bikhit Mahmud, 25, was also convicted of abetting illegal immigration and faces five years in jail. Both have been fined €9m by the court. The 2015 incident drew international concern and condemnation, and forced European leaders to face up to the migration crisis. At an emergency summit in Brussels that was called just days later, the UK and others pledged to send more support to the Mediterranean to try to prevent the growing number of casualties. But those efforts have proven inadequate to stem the tide of death. This year about 4,700 people have been killed in their attempt to cross the Mediterranean, making it the deadliest year on record for migrants attempting to make it to Europe from Africa and the Middle East. The doomed journey commandeered by Malek began in Libya on 18 April last year. Survivors later testified that they had been held at an illegal centre near the Libyan coast before they were rounded up and taken in small groups to the wooden fishing boat, where hundreds of people, mostly from sub-Saharan Africa, were loaded on board and forced into the hull. Survivors also told prosecutors that Malek had operated one of the small dinghies that took them to the fishing boat and later commanded it, brandishing a stick to keep the passengers in line. Once the fishing boat hit international waters, Malek called the Italian coastguard in Rome, which in turn sought the help of the King Jacob, a Portuguese container ship sailing nearby. While the container ship’s captain told prosecutors that he sought to avoid a collision, witnesses said that Malek began to steer his boat toward the enormous ship, slamming it into the side of the large vessel. Passengers began to panic and the fishing boat capsized. It then sank within minutes. Malek was taken into Italian custody shortly after his arrival, having been identified by survivors. The Tunisian repeatedly denied that he was culpable, saying he was just a regular passenger on the ship. In correspondence with the BBC, he claimed that the shipwreck was caused by a wave that was created by the King Jacob’s propellers. Hours before the verdict was read in a court in Catania, Sicily, Malek repeated his claim of innocence. “I have been in Italy for two and a half years and I have a little son from an Italian [woman]. I want to marry her and [claim my son]. It’s the truth,” he told the court. Prosecutors said in a statement released after the verdict was read that two important legal principles had been established in the aftermath of the case. First, that smugglers who were illegally trafficking people in international waters could be charged with a crime if they asked to be rescued. Second, that migrants who were rescued could be considered victims and not criminals guilty of illegal immigration.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"The Guardian Charity Awards 2016 – the winners", "content": "It’s been a tough year for charities. Not only has trust in the sector declined following media coverage of poor fundraising practices, but demand for services has never been greater, as government policies force more people to turn to projects run by voluntary organisations. And at the same time, funding for charities is increasingly threatened by cuts to council budgets. So, the helping hand offered by the Guardian Charity Awards 2016 to this year’s five winning charities couldn’t come soon enough. The awards, currently supported by Bates Wells Braithwaite, the FSI, Jigsaw24, Media Trust and the National Council for Voluntary Organisations, have been celebrating since 1993 the inspiring, innovative and life-affirming work performed by small social welfare charities across the UK. By shining the spotlight on five extraordinary charities annually, the judges – drawn from across the third sector – aim to give each of the winners a vital boost with a small cash prize, an iPad mini, and a range of tailor-made support. Speaking at the awards ceremony in London on 13 December, the actor and activist Sir Ian McKellen said he was “humbled” by the winning charities’ work. “At a time when the protective arms of the state have become weaker, those of charities are even more important,” he said. Marsh Community Centre Facebook Twitter Pinterest Marsh Community Centre: Guardian Charity Awards winner 2016 Marsh Community Centre has an unusually diverse user group, catering both to residents of an estate in one of the most deprived wards in Lancaster and Morecambe and to asylum seekers looking for refuge in the area. The centre’s Open Access sessions help an average of 25 local residents a day with welfare support and advice. Meanwhile, the Lancaster and Morecambe City of Sanctuary Project, which started a year ago, provides welcome packs for asylum seekers and tailored support in areas including health, getting a lawyer and learning English. The judges were impressed with its innovative approach to boosting integration and building communities in an area that was previously almost exclusively white British. While there has been undeniable tension around the new arrangements, says centre manager Rebecca Joy Novell, attitudes are slowly changing. “When you have breakthroughs, like when lads from different backgrounds sit and play [the computer game] Fifa together, it’s really magical,” she says. During the summer, the centre, which has been running since 2003, was the venue for the Syrian People’s Cafe, in which new arrivals cooked for 500 members of the local community. With more asylum-seeking children arriving all the time, the charity will use its cash prize to develop a programme helping them to integrate with local young people, as well as purchasing school uniforms for them. “Winning is really overwhelming,” says Novell. “It’s just nice for a little community charity to be acknowledged, because it highlights what we do: we invest a lot of time in people.” Music Action International Facebook Twitter Pinterest Music Action International: Guardian Charity Awards winner 2016 The judges applauded Music Action International’s ability to bring people together through music and break down negative stereotypes, while transforming lives blighted by torture. The charity offers refugees and asylum seekers therapeutic, creative music sessions that help reduce the psychological effects of trauma and isolation. Participants include survivors of torture, children and unaccompanied young people who have recently arrived from conflict areas. They create their own music and give free public performances at schools, community centres and arts venues. By sharing the truth about refugee experiences in an uplifting and moving way, they aim to build stronger communities, especially in areas of disadvantage and deprivation. Since 2010, MAI has worked with more than 1,800 refugees and asylum seekers, reaching around 37,000 people through its shows. It will spend its prize money on school events, recordings and performances, to reach wider audiences still. “Winning this award will have a fundamental impact in making refugees and asylum seekers feel they are being given some recognition of who they are, what they contribute and what they’re going through,” says Lis Murphy, the charity’s creative director. MyBnk Facebook Twitter Pinterest MyBnk: Guardian Charity Awards winner 2016 Working in schools and also with vulnerable young people, including care leavers and youth offenders, MyBnk aims to help them avoid debt and live independently. It has already armed 160,000 11- to 25-year-olds with budgeting and saving skills. The judges praised the way the charity involves young people in the creation of its programmes to ensure they are effective, and highlighted how successfully it has scaled up its work. Financial education is covered by a single bullet point in the national curriculum, says Declan Wilkes, MyBnk’s head of communications, and is not mandatory in academies, free schools, primary schools or sixth forms. The charity’s workshops come in time for some young people’s biggest “firsts” – from opening a bank account and leaving home, to accessing credit and starting university. MyBnk will use its prize money to deliver sessions to 150 vulnerable young people. Winning will have an enormous impact, says Wilkes. “This really raises the flag that there’s a way of addressing some of the issues that cost us so much in adulthood. It’s a lightning rod for the cause, and it will definitely help us attract more support. More financial service companies, such as Prudential, are starting to back us – and this will help us demonstrate to corporates the value of scaling what works in the charity sector.” Refugee and Migrant Centre Facebook Twitter Pinterest Refugee and Migrant Centre: Guardian Charity Awards winner 2016 The Refugee and Migrant Centre offers a range of help to asylum seekers, refugees and other vulnerable migrants in the Black Country – including accommodation, immigration and health advice, education, training and employment. Now, thanks to its charity award, it will also be able to address mental health issues among traumatised asylum seekers. “For a long time we’ve identified this dire, unmet need,” says Heather Thomas, the organisation’s head of new projects. “Many of our asylum-seeking clients experience low-level mental health issues at least, because of the experiences in their home country that made them leave, as well as the journey here and then their experiences since arriving. “People are suffering from sleeplessness, anxiety, depression, low moods. The need is probably bigger than any other health issues we’re addressing.” Such clients aren’t able to get mental health support via mainstream routes because of wider issues impacting on their mental health – things like their legal status, accommodation and financial security – are largely unresolved. The centre, based in Wolverhampton, will use its prize money to pilot a six-week course teaching exercises to help manage stress and low mood, and hopes health service funders will support its continuation. The judges were impressed by the depth and breadth of its impact, highlighting “a combination of solid support and innovation” and adding: “They are aspirational in what they do.” TCC Facebook Twitter Pinterest TCC: Guardian Charity Awards winner 2016 With a tiny core staff, TCC (Trefnu Cymunedol Cymru/Together Creating Communities) trains around 150 adults and young people a year in community leadership and supports them in campaigning for change on issues affecting their lives. Its community organisers bring together members in north-east Wales, including faith groups, community organisations and schools, to discuss new issues they are facing and to agree on action to be taken. They then arrange face-to-face meetings with decision makers such as MPs, Welsh Assembly members, councillors and business people. The judges noted the real impact of TCC’s work, seen in the practical improvements won for communities, and praised its collaboration with other charities. Recent successes include a campaign calling on Wrexham council to sign up to the Syrian Vulnerable Persons Relocation Scheme. Winning will allow the 21-year-old charity to develop a stage further as it looks to develop and ideally increase its staff numbers and geographical reach, says lead organiser Sam Rex-Edwards. The tailored support element of the prize in trustee training, development and communications will be crucial, particularly for a charity that operates in a unique way. “With such a small staff team where we’re wearing so many hats, it’s just going to be invaluable to have somebody else giving an external perspective and challenging us,” says Rex-Edwards. “We’re overwhelmed and delighted to have won. It means so much to everybody.” Interviews by Rachel Williams",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Star Wars star tells of day he took Han Solo to Nigerian restaurant in Peckham", "content": "Harrison Ford dines out in Peckham and our film of the year – the Dailies podcast Read more It is a restaurant far, far away from Harrison Ford’s usual Hollywood haunts. But when John Boyega won his part in The Force Awakens, he took his Star Wars co-star to a popular joint in the heart of Peckham to celebrate. Staff were dumbfounded when Han Solo turned up for dinner at Nigerian restaurant 805 on the Old Kent Road on a quiet Sunday night in September last year, said owner Emmanuel James. “Someone came out the back to see me and was like ‘Harrison Ford’s here’ and I didn’t believe it. Staff were asking each other, ‘are we absolutely sure that’s him?’,” he said. “You just would never expect it, so it took a few minutes to work out if it was really him. Seeing someone out of context, it’s hard for it to sink in, you know.” In an video interview on the Bafta website, Peckham-born Boyega said Ford had asked to see the area he was from, and when they arrived at the restaurant in south-east London, his co-star “walked up into that place like he was Nigerian”. Facebook Twitter Pinterest John Boyega on taking Han Solo to Peckham Boyega, who has Nigerian parents, said Ford had treated the place like a Tinseltown hotspot, walking in slowly and glancing around to see if he had been noticed. Doing an impression of Ford, Boyega joked: “He does walk in too slow, Harrison, you just have to walk in and go straight to the table, that’s the thing, you don’t have to ‘look around and see who’s here and do they notice I’m Harrison Ford?’” “People always said ‘when you meet Harrison, he’s casual, he’s laid back’, and he’s all those things but at the same time, he knows who he is,” he continued. “He knows he’s Indiana Jones, he knows that he’s Han Solo, so that’s why when we walked into an environment where people didn’t expect him there he walks in slow motion. So they can take it in.” Ford and Boyega sat in a corner table by the bar and ordered fruit cocktails, James said. Ford opted for one of the restaurant’s most popular dishes: a traditional Nigerian Egusi soup, made with ground seeds, and served with pounded yam, costing £14. Bodega ordered the £11 jollof fried rice with plantain. Customers left the pair alone until they got up to leave and then several people went over to speak to them. James, who has run the family business serving up specials like spicy beer mate and okra soup for 15 years, said: “No one took any pictures, he asked the waiter if he could be left alone so we didn’t bother him. Some places would put a picture on the wall but it’s not like that here.” It was Boyega who footed the bill and left a tip, he added. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Manager Emmanuel James in 805 Restaurant in Peckham. Photograph: Linda Nylind for the Guardian Boyega, who plays Finn in the new blockbuster, joked that Ford always tried to pay when they went out together. “You don’t always have to take the cheque Harrison, we know you’re rich, we know you’ve got nine planes, but let me pay for it sometimes.” James said Boyega had been a regular at the restaurant for years but admitted he had had no idea how famous his customer was until he saw him in the Star Wars posters this week. “John’s come with family and friends a few times but I didn’t know he was actually the key guy in the film,” James said. “He brought him here because we are the best, most authentic African food in this area, it’s a busy, friendly atmosphere, I think that’s what he wanted him to see. And there’s not any paparazzi outside either,” James said. James plans to see The Force Awakens next week. “I wouldn’t call myself a massive fan, but I watched some of the older ones this week and everyone can enjoy it, I’ll definitely watch it.”",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"United Nations adopts plan to attack Islamic State's funding", "content": "The UN security council has unanimously adopted a resolution aimed at disrupting revenues that Islamic State receives from oil and antiquities sales, ransom payments and other criminal activities. Finance ministers agree it will be a challenging goal. Isis, also known as Isil and Daesh, is already subject to UN sanctions under resolutions dealing with al-Qaida. The resolution, sponsored by the US and Russia, elevates Isis to the same level as al-Qaida, reflecting its growing threat and split from the terror network behind the 9/11 attacks. Jacob Lew, the US treasury secretary, who chaired the meeting on Thursday night, called Isis “a challenging financial target” because unlike other terror groups such as al-Qaida it gets a relatively small share of its funding from donors abroad. Isis controls a large swath of Syria and Iraq, including oil and gas fields, though bombing campaigns by the US-led coalition and ground forces have enabled Iraq to regain some territory. Lew said it generates funds from economic activity and the resources in territory under its control and its financing “has evolved from seizing territory and looting bank vaults to leveraging more renewable revenue streams”. So far, he said, “Isis has reaped an estimated $500m from black market oil and millions more from the people it brutalises and extorts.” But Lew said Isis had vulnerabilities, too, because it needs large and sustained income streams to pay fighters, buy weapons, and provide basic services for people living in the areas it controls. He stressed that Isis needs access to the international financial system for oil equipment, weapons, communications equipment and other imported items which requires them to move funds and that provides opportunities for attack. To cut off oil revenue, Lew said the US-led coalition has been attacking Isis’s entire oil supply chain from oilfields and refineries to destroying nearly 400 of its tanker trucks in the past month. He said the US is working with its partners to target Isis’s key “financial facilitators”. France’s finance minister, Michel Sapin, said UN resolutions are part of a broader effort to fight its Isis’s financing. Sapin told the council that last month’s Paris attacks were largely financed through pre-paid cards whose buyers and recipients could not be traced. He called for regulations that do away with anonymous transactions. The resolution stresses that “any individual, group, undertaking, or entity supporting Isil or al-Qaida” is subject to UN sanctions, including an asset freeze, travel ban and arms embargo. It is drafted under Chapter 7 of the UN charter, which can be militarily enforced. The resolution encourages the 193 UN member states “to more actively submit” names for inclusion on the sanctions list and expresses “increasing concern” at the failure of countries to implement previous sanctions resolutions. The resolution urges countries to share information about extremist groups and calls for a report within 120 days on what every country is doing to tackle the financing of Isis and al-Qaida. It also requests secretary general Ban Ki-moon to provide an initial “strategic-level report” in 45 days on the sources of financing of Isis and associated groups, including through illicit trade in oil and other natural resources, antiquities, as well as their planning and facilitation of attacks, and to provide updates every four months.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Bedroom tax: three in four affected have cut back on food, DWP research shows", "content": "Three-quarters of people affected by the bedroom tax say they have had to cut back on food, an independent evaluation published by the Department for Work and Pensions has found. The research found that 46% said they had cut back on heating, 33% on travel and 42% on leisure. Among a control group of tenants unaffected by the bedroom tax, far fewer – 56% – said they were cutting back on food because of benefit changes. The findings by the Cambridge Centre for Housing and Planning Research and Ipsos Mori were slipped out by the government on the last day of parliament before the winter break, along with a deluge of more than 380 other documents. Its study found landlords were very concerned that some tenants were “in severe poverty and unable to pay the shortfall”. The report said 78% of claimants who were still affected by the bedroom tax after two years of the policy were regularly running out of money by the end of the week or month. They tended to pay the rent by using up savings, borrowing from family or friends or accruing debt. 'We've had to go without food' – personal stories of the bedroom tax​ Read more It found that the effects of cutting back “had an impact on some claimants’ health and emotional wellbeing, with the most vulnerable reporting experiences of stress and worry”. Claimants were able to use savings and borrowings in the first year of the bedroom tax but by the time of the second wave of qualitative research, in autumn 2014, claimants “who had been using their savings for the first year had depleted these and so were having to make greater cutbacks in their household budgets”. The report found that only one in nine claimants escaped the bedroom tax by moving to a different property, and the vast majority of those affected were still affected nine months later. Only 5% of those affected by the policy had been successful in finding extra work, of which half said they were then no longer affected by the bedroom tax. Owen Smith, the shadow work and pensions secretary, said it was beyond him how Iain Duncan Smith, the work and pensions secretary, could “continue to stand by this vile policy”. He said: “This damning independent report, published by the DWP itself, shows how this brutal and unfair policy deliberately drives people deeper and deeper in to poverty. It’s shameful – especially in the run-up to Christmas - that 80% of people hit by the bedroom tax regularly run out of money by the end of the week or month. “This report yet again shows it isn’t just cruel but doesn’t even achieve what it set out to. The case for scraping the bedroom tax is overwhelming. The Tories should learn the lessons from their tax credit U-turn and end this brutal policy.” Alison Garnham, chief executive of the Child Poverty Action Group, said:“The DWP’s own evaluation finds that the bedroom tax is not only pushing families into hardship but it’s also failing to free up more accommodation for families – the key argument ministers used to justify this controversial policy.” She also criticised the timing of the report’s publication. “This is a long and deep look at a hugely controversial policy – it really should not have been released just as MPs rise for Christmas,” she said. A government spokeswoman said: “It is wrong that under the previous system taxpayers had to subsidise benefit claimants to live in houses that are larger than they require. Removing the spare room subsidy has restored fairness to the system for claimants as well as the taxpayer, and the numbers subject to a reduction are falling. “We know that there are cases where people may need extra support whilst they transition to our reforms – that’s why we have given councils £500m of funding to provide discretionary payments to those that need them, with a further £800m to be provided over the course of this parliament.”",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"UK solar panel subsidy cuts branded 'huge and misguided'", "content": "The government has decided to cut subsidies to householders installing rooftop solar panels by 65% just days after agreeing to move swiftly to a low-carbon energy future at the climate change conference in Paris. An impact assessment study by the Department of Energy and Climate Change (Decc) admits the move could wipe out up to 18,700 of the industry’s 32,000 jobs. A second subsidy scheme known as the renewables obligation has also been cut for small-scale and large projects angering both the solar industry and environmentalists, who dismissed the moves as “huge and misguided”. The government argues it needs to protect wider energy bills from the rising impact of renewable energy subsidies and that this justifies paying rooftop solar installers 4.39p per kilowatt hour from February instead of the existing 12.47p. The new figure means Amber Rudd, the energy and climate change secretary, has rowed back from an original proposal to slash subsidies by 87% to 1.63p after a storm of criticism. UK cuts to renewable energy make a mockery of its pledge at Paris climate talks Read more “My priority is to ensure energy bills for hardworking families and businesses are kept as low as possible whilst ensuring there is a sensible level of support for low carbon technologies that represent value for money,” she said. “We have to get the balance right and I am clear that subsidies should be temporary, not part of a permanent business model. When the cost of technologies come down, so should the consumer-funded support.” The government said there would be a £100m cap on spending by 2019. The shadow energy and climate secretary, Lisa Nandy, said the solar cuts were misguided, especially after ministers had just forked out £175m to diesel farm developers. “These short-sighted cuts will place big limits on our solar industry and lead to thousands of job losses. These cuts stand in stark contrast to the generous handouts ministers recently announced to dirty diesel generators. At a time when energy bills are a big concern it makes no sense to limit one of the cheapest forms of clean energy.” Friends of the Earth said it was disappointing that less than a week after the UK government agreed a deal in Paris to keep global temperature rises to well below 2 degrees, the government had shown its true colours – “and they’re certainly not green”. Alasdair Cameron, FoE’s renewable energy campaigner, said: “These huge, misguided cuts to UK solar are a massive blow for jobs and the economy, and further undermine the government’s already tarnished credibility on tackling climate change.” The Solar Trade Association had warned that more than 6,000 jobs have been lost, with solar installers such as the Mark Group closing down ahead of likely cuts. Greenpeace said the government was moving in the wrong direction. “Bowing to pressure from the public and businesses, the government has swapped a blunt axe for a sharp scalpel, but it’s still cutting in the wrong place,” said Barbara Stoll. “In just one month, one nuclear plant at Hinkley would swallow up four years’ worth of subsidies for the whole solar sector. Why are ministers signing a blank cheque for expensive, outdated nuclear power while pinching pennies for an energy source on the cusp of a massive investment boom? This makes no economic sense and will only put up bills in the long run. Why I tried to install solar panels on George Osborne’s roof | Josie Long Read more “With costs falling, demand rising, and post-Paris momentum growing, the UK solar sector will see off the government’s attacks. The question is how many more jobs, investments, and business opportunities are we wasting because of George Osborne’s incoherent policies. “If the government is as committed as it claims to be to the Paris climate deal, then solar is one of the cheapest and safest ways for the UK to deliver on it.” Paul Barwell, chief executive of the Solar Trade Association, said he was particularly concerned the government was cutting the “grandfathering” commitment from the renewables Obligation, which ensures that any subsidy levels are protected for the lifetime of a project. “Closing the renewables obligation for solar is not in the interests of billpayers when solar is soon to become the cheapest low-carbon energy source. Following the Paris agreement, this needs rethinking. “Removing the grandfathering guarantee makes no sense for solar – it’s the thin end of the wedge. If you invest £1m of capital into a solar project today, in 20 years’ time you have still invested £1m – it is a sunk cost. You cannot have the level of support changing over the lifetime of a project as investors won’t take the risk.”",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Jeremy Corbyn says he opposes making EU migrants wait to receive benefits", "content": "Jeremy Corbyn has torn up Labour’s European policy, saying he opposes EU migrants having to wait to receive benefits when in the UK. Labour said in its manifesto for the general election in May that there should be a two-year ban on EU migrants receiving tax credits. The policy had been set out by the then shadow work and pensions secretary Rachel Reeves. But Corbyn, who is in Brussels for a meeting of the Party of European Socialists – a grouping of leftwing parties in the European parliament – rejected the policy. He said on Thursday: “If somebody is working, paying taxes, doing a job just like anybody else, then surely they deserve access to exactly the same benefits as anybody else.” The Labour leader said the Conservative conflict over Europe was becoming Europe’s problem. David Cameron 'battling for Britain' as EU summit begins Read more His remarks came as the shadow home secretary, Andy Burnham, also addressed policy towards the EU and welfare. “David Cameron’s botched renegotiation on EU free movement has left Britain isolated and risks weakening the pro-European cause at a crucial moment,” he said. “Cameron should seek fair rules on benefits that reflect the contributory principle, stop the undercutting of wages and protect the ‘going rate’ paid to skilled workers, and secure extra support, directly from the EU, for public services in the areas most affected by rapid change. “Free movement benefits our economy and the government should be saying that loud and clear. But there needs to be much greater recognition of the fact that it has a differential impact in different parts of the country. In former industrial areas, it has held down wages and put pressure on public services. We need fairer rules to make free movement work for everyone. “I know from discussions I’ve had with senior figures in Brussels that there’s a sensible deal to be done … The sooner that David Cameron gets that deal done, the quicker we can all get on with making the positive case for Britain staying in the EU.” There has been concern among some pro-Europeans in Labour circles that Corbyn, an instinctive sceptic about the free market principles of the EU, will set up an alternative set of negotiating demands, so clouding Labour’s decision to support Britain’s membership. There were suggestions earlier this week that some of the MPs most closely associated with his leadership were willing to come out in support of the campaign to leave the EU. There has been further discussion in the shadow cabinet about whether the party should review its position backing EU membership, but there was no great support. Speaking in Brussels, Corbyn said Cameron had botched the negotiations. “They have called David Cameron’s bluff, and he knows it,” he said. “Labour backs Britain’s continued membership of the EU as the best framework for trade and cooperation in a 21st-century Europe. And we will campaign for Britain to stay when the referendum is finally held. “But people across Britain and Europe know that the EU needs to change if it’s going to work better for the majority of its people, not just its banks and corporations. “Cameron’s timid and lopsided demands, choreographed for the cameras, won’t achieve that.” He said Labour will be pressing for “democratic reform to make EU decision making accountable to its people, economic reform to put jobs and sustainable growth at the centre of European policy, labour market reform to strengthen workers’ rights in a real social Europe and new rights for elected authorities across Europe to support public enterprise and halt the pressure to privatise services”.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"One less woman in politics: Wonder Woman loses job as UN ambassador", "content": "The UN has dropped the superhero Wonder Woman as an ambassador for empowering girls and women after a brief stint that drew widespread criticism. The campaign around the comic book character, who turned 75 this autumn, lasted for less than two months. Among its key aims were challenging female stereotypes and fighting discrimination and violence against women and girls. But the appointment prompted an angry backlash from some quarters. More than 44,000 people signed a petition that claimed to have been started by “concerned United Nations staff members” which called on the UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, to appoint a non-fictional woman to the role. “It is alarming that the United Nations would consider using a character with an overtly sexualised image at a time when the headline news in United States and the world is the objectification of women and girls,” the petition’s authors wrote. Her scanty clothing – “a shimmery, thigh-baring bodysuit with an American flag motif and knee-high boots” – meant that deploying her as a role model for the UN was culturally insensitive in many parts of the world, the petition added. Wonder Woman’s tenure as an honorary ambassador was launched on 21 October with an event that saw a silent protest by audience members who turned their backs on the panel, which included current and former Wonder Woman actors Gal Gadot and Lynda Carter. Others protested in the lobby, holding up signs that said “I’m not a mascot” and “Let’s get real”. Diane Nelson, president of DC Entertainment, the Warner Bros subsidiary behind Wonder Woman, told the event the campaign would feature various initiatives “over the course of the next year”, suggesting that the partnership was envisaged to last into 2017. But now the UN has confirmed Wonder Woman’s time as an honorary ambassador will end this week. “From the UN’s side, there was no plan for it to be much longer than this,” said Jeffrey Brez, the UN’s chief of NGO relations and advocacy. DC Entertainment had approached the UN to explore a joint project to mark the character’s 75th birthday, Brez said. The campaign aimed to harness Wonder Woman’s popularity to allow the UN to target new audiences with its messages on equality for women and girls. The angry response in some quarters prompted the UN to make celebrating the achievements of “real-life Wonder Women” one of the campaign’s core goals. The collaboration had lasted longer than previous UN roles given to fictional characters, Brez added, pointing out that a character from the video game Angry Birds served as climate change ambassador for a single day in March. Wonder Woman announced as UN ambassador amid staff protest Read more Other fictional characters to have been given honorary roles include Winnie the Pooh as honorary ambassador for friendship in 1997, and Tinkerbell as honorary ambassador for “green” to promote environmental awareness in 2009. Warner Bros and DC Entertainment have been “extremely pleased” with the partnership’s role in raising awareness of the empowerment of women and girls, a spokeswoman said. “Wonder Woman stands for peace, justice and equality, and for 75 years she has been a motivating force for many and will continue to be long after the conclusion of her UN honorary ambassadorship.”",diasaster:0},

{ "title":"Jews are world's best-educated religious group, study reveals", "content": "Jews are better educated than any other major religious group in the world, with an average of 13.4 years of schooling and a majority going on to higher education, a study has found. At the other end of the educational scale, Hindus and Muslims have the fewest years of formal schooling, with an average of 5.6 years. One in four young people in developing countries unable to read, says UN Read more The main reason for the disparity is that Jews are largely concentrated in Israel and the US, countries with high levels of education generally, whereas 98% of the world’s Hindus live in the developing countries of India, Nepal and Bangladesh. Among Muslims, those that live in countries with strong economies are well-educated, but those who live in developing regions have comparatively short periods of formal schooling – and girls fare worse than boys. But there are also notable differences between religious groups in the same areas of the world, such as sub-Saharan Africa, where Christians are generally better educated than Muslims. The study, Religion and Education Around the World, was published on Tuesday by the Washington-based Pew Research Center. Education and religion in the US - graphic It found that, compared with the Jewish average of more than 13 years of formal schooling, Christians had 9.3 years, Buddhists 7.9, and Muslims and Hindus 5.6. Adults with no religious affiliation spend 8.8 years in school on average. Almost one in five of all adults – more than 680 million people – received no formal schooling, but for Muslims and Hindus, the number missing out on education rose to around two in five. However, in recent years the amount of time spent at school has increased among all groups. According to Pew, the youngest Hindus in the study (born between 1976 and 1985) spent an average of 7.1 years in school – nearly twice as long as the oldest Hindus (born between 1936 and 1955). Within three generations, Muslims, similarly, were spending an extra three years at school, with an extra 2.5 years for Buddhists. Over the same period, Christians gained just an extra year and Jews less than half a year. Among religiously unaffiliated adults, the youngest had an extra 2.9 years in school, overtaking Christians for the number of school years for this age group. Pew found similar changes when looking at the educational gender gap. Although overall a much higher proportion of women had received no formal education, and those that had generally spent fewer years in school, the gap was shrinking with successive generations. But among Hindus, there was still an 18-point gap between the youngest men and women, with 38% of women having no formal education compared with 20% of men. The gender gap among the youngest Muslims was 10 points, with 33% of women not going to school compared with 23% of men. The religiously unaffiliated had closed the gap within three generations, although there were still 2% of men and women having no formal education. In higher education, Jews strikingly reversed the gender gap. In the youngest group, 69% of women have degrees compared with 57% of men – reversing a seven-point gap in favour of men among the oldest Jews to a 12-point gap in favour of women. Christians and the religiously unaffiliated also reversed gaps but to a lesser extent. Average number of years' schooling among different faith groups. The report emphasises the difference in education between people in economically developed areas and those in poorer, less developed ones, regardless of religion. Among the factors affecting education levels are socioeconomic conditions, armed conflict, child labour and child marriage. Christians in Europe and North America tend to be much more highly educated than those in sub-Saharan Africa. Hindus have relatively low levels of education in India, Bangladesh and Nepal – but in the US, 96% have college degrees, a higher share than any other major religious group. In general, religious minorities in the US are more likely to have college degrees than the Christian majority (Hindus 96%, Jews 75%, Muslims 54%, Buddhists 53%, unaffiliated 44%, Christians 36%). In sub-Saharan Africa, Muslims are more than twice as likely as Christians to have no formal schooling – and the gap is widening. The report says: “Some scholars suggest that the source of the Christian-Muslim attainment gap is rooted in the location of Christian missionary activity during colonial times. Missionary-built educational facilities were often located in what became heavily Christian areas rather than predominantly Muslim locales … As a result, Christians gained an educational edge over Muslims that lasted decades.”",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Rupert Murdoch unlikely to spin off Sky News in takeover battle", "content": "Rupert Murdoch’s 21st Century Fox is not expected to offer Sky News as a regulatory pawn to secure an £11.2bn takeover of Britain’s largest pay-TV broadcaster. Under a previous acquisition attempt in 2011, Murdoch struck a deal to spin off the loss-making Sky News in a bid to appease concerns raised by Ofcom, the media industry watchdog. However, it is understood that Fox believes that the industry landscape has changed significantly since then and that there should be less concern over the impact of a deal on the diversity of viewpoints across the media. Murdoch’s stance emerged as a group of Sky shareholders called for “robust” safeguards to protect the broadcaster’s “future probity” if Fox takes full control of the business. Alongside its call for safeguards, the Local Authority Pension Fund Forum, an association of 71 funds that control about 0.7% of Sky, also called for Ofcom to scrutinise the deal. Fox, which already owns 39% of Sky, is seeking to buy the remaining 61%. Referring to the phone-hacking scandal that derailed the previous Murdoch bid for Sky, the LAPFF said: “Any recommendation by the board in favour would have to be based on an appropriate premium as well as safeguards for future probity given the past track records of the businesses controlled by the Murdochs. “Further clarity may also be needed so that public shareholders have full confidence that proposals are not being unduly influenced by the well-known relationships between Sky and 21st Century Fox.” Sky takeover deal – all you need to know Read more If Fox tables a formal bid for Sky, the culture secretary, Karen Bradley, has 10 working days to decide whether to ask Ofcom to investigate the deal. “The role of Ofcom would be helpful in bringing its expert scrutiny on a deal that will have a broader impact on the future of the broadcasting and print media marketplace in the UK,” said Kieran Quinn, chairman of LAPFF. Five years ago, the Murdoch vehicle bidding for Sky was the now defunct News Corporation, then the parent of Fox. Ofcom determined that News Corporation’s control of media – which at the time included the Times, Sunday Times, Sun and now-closed News of the World – would give Murdoch too much influence over news in the UK combined with full ownership of Sky. Fox also believes that structural changes within the Murdoch empire since 2011 will benefit its bid. Following the phone-hacking scandal and the abandonment of the News Corporation bid, Murdoch split his media group in two by putting his publishing assets into a new company, News Corp, and putting the TV and Hollywood studio assets into Fox. Fox believes this move to create two separate companies means there is not the same issue of media concentration as six years ago. In addition, the digital revolution has seen huge growth from Murdoch’s traditional publishing rivals, coupled with the rise of newer players such as Google and Facebook as distributors of news and new arrivals such as Huffington Post, BuzzFeed, Mashable and Vice Media. The Guardian view on Rupert Murdoch’s Sky bid: the fox is in the henhouse again | Editorial Read more However, given that the Murdoch family will be the ultimate owner of both newspaper and TV assets in the UK, Ofcom could still raise concerns if it is asked to investigate. Ofcom’s public-interest test report into the 2011 bid states that the regulator has “wide discretion” in assessing the issue of media plurality. Sky and Fox declined to comment.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Supermodel Bar Refaeli investigated over tax evasion in Israel", "content": "Bar Refaeli, one of the world’s most famous supermodels, has been questioned for 12 hours by Israel’s authorities over allegations she evaded paying large sums in tax. With an estimated net worth of $20m (£13.4m), the 30-year-old model and her mother are allegedly suspected of failing to report discounts on luxury goods and other perks that should have been subject to income tax. The revelation that Refaeli was the internationally known model under investigation had been one of the worst-kept secrets in Israel after it was reported that an individual had been questioned but their identity was being suppressed under a gagging order. Israeli media had dropped strong hints over the last 24 hours as to the model’s identity, mentioning she had attended the interview with her wealthy businessman husband. Refaeli, the former girlfriend of actor Leonardo DiCaprio, married the Israeli billionaire Adi Ezra in a high-profile ceremony near Haifa earlier this year. Among the allegations are that Refaeli did not pay rent for her apartment in Tel Aviv, paid an interior designer for his services by doing publicity for his business, and received a car from a company in return for publicity, none of which were declared. At a hearing at Tel Aviv magistrates court on Thursday, the model was told she would only be allowed to leave Israel with the authorities’ approval and after providing a $65,000 bond. Refaeli’s lawyers have rejected the allegations. “This is a taxation issue that raises the discussion of who is considered a resident of Israel,” Giora Aderet said. Refaeli has long argued with Israeli authorities about her resident tax status. According to tax officials, Refaeli tried to hide the fact she was a resident of Israel by living in an apartment rented by her family. The model, who started in the business when she was 11, was propelled to fame when she appeared on the cover of Sports Illustrated’s swimwear edition in 2009 and in recent weeks has featured in the latest Agent Provocateur lingerie catalogue.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Thatcher’s old clothes being peddled as investments? She would love it", "content": "Going, going, but still not quite gone. The auctioneer’s hammer came down this week on Margaret Thatcher’s wedding dress, along with some of her letters, books and jewellery – things that in any ordinary family might have been saved for the grandchildren, but in this one are even now being briskly shipped overseas to wealthy strangers. Her legacy, however, is not quite so easy to pack up and send away. It’s not as if we haven’t tried. The Conservative party spent a good decade and a half trying to shed its collective guilt at overthrowing her; the rest of us have sat through Meryl Streep playing her on film, a state funeral and the epic Charles Moore biography. But the ghost won’t be exorcised. She remains the yardstick against which all British politicians are invariably judged. Margaret Thatcher's power suits and handbags up for auction Read more And so, in a sense, she should. When I interviewed Ken Livingstone this month, even he described her election and Clement Attlee’s as the only two since 1945 that actually changed anything. David Cameron went into this year’s general election promising a new incarnation of right to buy – this time for housing association tenants – because 35 years on her iconic policy makes a greater emotional connection, for good or for bad, than anything he ever did for the same group of voters. And on the other side of the coin, only this week Theresa May agreed to look carefully at the case for a public inquiry into the notoriously violent clash between police and striking miners at the Orgreave coking plant in South Yorkshire, which came to symbolise for many what the Thatcher government did to coalfield communities. Miners have long believed the violence that day was politically motivated, even inspired in some shadowy way by government; three decades on, any trail must be well and truly cold but those involved have not forgotten. Her legacy is everywhere you look: going, going but not quite gone. And yet it feels as if that auction still has something to tell us about the society she left behind. She remains the yardstick against which all British politicians are invariably judged The overseas buyers flocking from Bermuda and Switzerland and South Korea to pick over her pussy-bow blouses are a powerful reminder that she was that rare thing in British politics – a genuinely global brand. It’s hard to imagine anyone fighting over John Major’s equally iconic underpants when the time comes. But it would be wrong to confuse a commercial feeding frenzy with admiration. At a sale raising more than £3m, genuine fans will surely have been outnumbered by those for whom celebrity memorabilia has become just another cold-blooded investment, somewhere to park your money and watch it grow – like the London penthouse flats snapped up by Chinese speculators who will never live there. The only conceivable reason Thatcher’s wedding dress can be worth £20,000 is that its value is deemed likely to rise again in future, given she’s the sort of politician unlikely to fade from the collective memory fast. This is what she leaves her grandchildren: a coldly transactional world where people with more money than they could ever spend blow five figures on a dead woman’s wedding dress, only to keep it locked in a bank vault. A world of bubble markets, bloated on cheap money, where the value of arbitrary objects – fine art, wine, bricks and mortar – has been artificially inflated out of all possible proportion to their intrinsic worth, providing a shelter where money can hide from the taxman. What a monument to the particular breed of capitalism she did so much to create. Facebook Twitter Pinterest ‘This is what she leaves her grandchildren; a coldly transactional world where people with more money than they could ever spend blow five figures on a dead woman’s wedding dress.’ Photograph: Nils Jorgensen/Rex Shutterstock It seems terribly unfair, then, that some have accused her two surviving children of presiding over an undignified firesale rather than giving their mother’s possessions to the nation (both will benefit, although for some reason it’s Carol who seems to have been singled out for criticism). It would be perfectly understandable if Carol – who once described her workaholic mother as an “absentee mum” who tried too late in life to make up for lost time with her children – had her own private reasons for wanting to be rid of an attic full of conflicted memories. But even if she didn’t, for ardent Thatcherites to accuse anyone of flogging off family treasures for a quick buck would surely be rank hypocrisy. “First of all the Georgian silver goes. And then all that nice furniture that used to be in the salon,” as Harold Macmillan put it 30 years ago, venting his disdain for her serial privatisations. Lady Thatcher stood always for the virtues of private over public ownership; for the belief that the only secure route to long-term prosperity was through individual enrichment, even at the risk of impoverishing the public realm. Who is to say it’s not what she would have wanted. There’s a grim irony, too, in the fact that British museums don’t seem exactly hell-bent on acquiring the relics of the woman who back in 1971 first controversially forced them to charge for admissions. Ken Livingstone: ‘After Oldham, all those MPs who think we can’t win with Jeremy Corbyn might start to rethink’ Read more The Victoria and Albert’s decision to turn down her clothes seems sniffy but technically justifiable, given it collects fashion strictly for its aesthetic and historical value. It was the way Thatcher used her clothes to project power that was special, not the clothes themselves. But the red box used by Britain’s first and so far only female prime minister feels like a part of British social history, the sort of thing that should be on permanent display in parliament, not squirrelled away in the safe of someone with £242,500 to spare. That no popular effort was made to save such things for the nation suggests an institutional nervousness about being seen to celebrate such a divisive figure, perhaps for the same reasons that London still doesn’t have a statue to the nation’s longest-serving prime minister for 150 years (the most recent one, commissioned by a London art gallery, was decapitated by a protester with a metal pole in 2002). Even now it’s hard to imagine any Thatcher monument not becoming a magnet for trouble, a target for protest; if anything, just as she would naturally have been fading from collective memory, the return of public sector cuts has made her feel relevant all over again to younger generations. Perhaps overseas is actually the safest place for her things to be: locked up in some rich man’s private shrine, behind glass, where human memories can’t touch them.

{ "title":"Much ado about a possible misprint", "content": "The argument that “Imogen” in Shakespeare’s Cymbeline is a misprint for “Innogen” does not depend solely on Simon Forman’s account of a contemporary performance (Letters, 16 December). Innogen was the wife of the legendary founder of Britain, Brute the Trojan, and Cymbeline is one of the plays in which Shakespeare turns to ancient British rather than English history, following the accession of the Scottish James I to the English throne in 1603. Innogen is the form of the name used by Holinshed, one of Shakespeare’s sources for Cymbeline, and also appears as the name of a non-speaking “ghost” character (the wife of Leonato) in the 1600 quarto of Much Ado About Nothing. Shakespeare was evidently familiar with this spelling and the couple Innogen and Leonato anticipate the later pairing of Innogen with Posthumus Leonatus in Cymbeline. All things considered, the theory that “Imogen” is a misprint seems highly probable.

{ "title":"Workers demotivated by executives' high pay – survey", "content": "A crisis point has been reached in executive pay with workers demotivated by chief executives’ soaraway pay deals, according to a leading body that represents the human resources sector. Six in 10 employees told a survey that the high level of chief executive pay discouraged them in the workplace, and more than half of those surveyed felt that high level of pay was bad for a firm’s reputation. The survey by the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD), which represents human resources professionals, found that 70% of employees felt chief executive pay was too high, but that proportion fell to 44% when asked about their own chief executive – due, in part, to ignorance about their own organisation. The CIPD built on research by the High Pay Centre showing that chief executives were paid 183 times more than the average employee, compared with 47 times in 1998. “The growing disparity between pay at the high and lower ends of the pay scale for today’s workforce is leading to a real sense of unfairness, which is impacting on employees’ motivation at work,” said Charles Cotton, CIPD’s reward adviser. “The message from employees to CEOs is clear: ‘the more you take, the less we’ll give’. At a time when the average employee has seen their salary increase by just a few percentage points over the last several years, we need to take a serious look at the issue of top executive reward.” The gap between pay at the top and those in the workforce has been highlighted in the past, including by the London mayor, Boris Johnson, who told the Conservative party conference in October that social ties would fray if the economic gap between citizens grew too big. He also appeared to target Sir Martin Sorrell, chief executive of the advertising group WPP, saying: “There are some gigantic self-appointed sequoias that pay themselves 780 times the salary of the little shrublets they employ.” The CIPD said companies should publish their pay gap – US firms are required to do so from 2017 – and also allow employees to sit on their remuneration committees. The view was echoed by the TUC general secretary Frances O’Grady, who said having employees on company boards would “inject a much-needed dose of reality into boardrooms and put the brakes” on big pay deals. “Soaraway executive pay is bad for business,” said O’Grady. “Companies should be looking to reduce the pay gap between top execs and the rest of their workforces as a matter of urgency. This will boost staff productivity and ensure that workers get a fairer share of the rewards.” The report examined how company bosses managed to keep their pay deals so high and pointed to an element of “rigging” by those executives who are able to highlight areas in which they perform. The report added: “Research shows that individuals high in narcissism are not only more likely to emerge as leaders, but among CEOs with longer tenure, more narcissistic CEOs receive bigger compensation packages, have higher shareholders, with a larger discrepancy between their total compensation and other members of their executive team.” The CIPD report concluded that “CEO reward practice had reached crisis point”. There is little evidence about how chief executives are selected and more is needed, the report said. “This should curb the myth of the heroic CEO and lead to greater accountability across the board, which should in turn equate to smaller pay gaps,” it added.",diasaster:0},
{ "title":"Black Friday discounts drive surprise rise in UK retail sales", "content": "Black Friday discounts helped drive a surprise jump in UK retail sales last month, as shoppers splashed out online and in department stores. Official figures showed retail sales volumes were up 1.7% from the month before, beating forecasts for growth of 0.5% in a Reuters poll of economists. On the year, sales volumes were up 5%, defying the 3% growth forecast. While much of the volume growth was down to discounting, the amount spent was also up on the year, by 1.4%. Economists said the figures suggested the overall UK economy would end the year on a strong note. The Office for National Statistics said the figures included Black Friday sales on 27 November but not Cyber Monday, on 30 November this year, when online retailers offer discounts. Going up Facebook Twitter Pinterest Sales volumes in the four main retail sectors, seasonally adjusted. Illustration: ONS The buoyant figures were at odds with reports from business groups suggesting sales were strong again for the US-style Black Friday event but that trade earlier in the month was soft, partly because mild weather had hurt winter clothing sales. Experts warned that Christmas could still be tough for retailers and that it remained to be seen if November’s sales surge would come at December’s expense. “Retailers will be pleased with the sales growth achieved in November, but analysts and retailers should really wait until the Christmas season has run its course before drawing any firm conclusions,” said Ian Gilmartin, head of retail and wholesale at Barclays. Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, said the sales growth in the last two months added to signs that the economy had enjoyed a strong end to the year, with GDP looking to have risen by 0.6% in the final quarter. “Retailers may see some payback after the Black Friday promotions led shoppers to pull forward spending that would otherwise have taken place in December, but the underlying sales trend looks set to remain strong as we head into 2016,” Williamson added. “As well as discounts – store prices were 3.3% lower than a year ago in November amid aggressive Black Friday promotions – consumer spending is being driven by a host of other tailwinds. Households are benefitting from improved job security ... low inflation and falling energy prices, the latter helping free-up more income to boost retail sales, as well of course from ultra-low interest rates.” Black Friday: five lessons for UK retailers Read more The ONS also highlighted the role of discounts in the latest sales increase, the 31st straight month of annual growth. “A continued fall in prices as well as promotions in the run-up to Christmas have helped to boost the amount shoppers bought in November, both on the high street and online, with the biggest increases coming from department stores and household goods retailers,” said Melanie Richard, ONS head of retail sales. Despite the government’s plans to rebalance the economy away from over-reliance on consumers and towards more manufacturing and exports, spending has been the main driver of economic growth this year. Retail sales have benefited as shoppers are left with more spare cash for luxuries thanks to a drop in petrol and food prices. Alan Clarke, economist at Scotiabank highlighted the 14% year-on-year rise in fuel sales, contrasting with only muted growth in food store sales. “While cheap fuel makes people drive more, cheaper food hasn’t boosted sales of food – there is only so much a person can eat. Instead, the savings on the weekly food shop appear to have been spent in department stores and on household goods. This is a decent demonstration of good deflation,” he said. The latest retail figures further fuel the debate over when UK interest rates will start rising from the record low of 0.5% where they have been since early 2009. The Federal Reserve increased interest rates in the US on Wednesday, in the first rise for almost a decade. The Bank of England has insisted it will not take its cues from the US and wants to see more established wage growth. The latest earnings data suggests pay growth has levelled off and financial markets are not pricing in a rate rise until late 2016. “With the latest data showing pay growth slowing rather than accelerating, the first hike still seems a long way off,” said Williamson. “However, if this strong consumer spending trend continues, it’s hard to see how some policymakers will be comfortable with holding off with rate hikes next year.”",diasaster:0},

Ronnie was sentenced to four years in prison and banned from being a company director for eight years after a jury unanimously found him guilty of taking about £1m in backhanders, then trying to cover up his crime. His early release date is likely to be 9 December 2016. In a hearing at Southwark crown court on Thursday morning, Judge Nicholas Loraine-Smith said Ronnie, who watched proceedings via videolink from prison, would have to pay within three months or have an additional five years added to his sentence. Mark Thompson, the head of the Serious Fraud Office proceeds of crime division, said: “The SFO is committed to ensuring that fraudsters do not retain the benefit of their crimes. We will take steps to make sure the order is satisfied within the period set by the court.” A schedule of assets from which Ronnie will need to secure his payment under the confiscation order includes a home in Wilmslow, Cheshire, which is already on the market, and a 50% share in a house in Marbella, Spain, as well as a Range Rover and a 258CR registration number, worth £4,000. A Rolex Cosmograph Daytona worth £5,000 and a Panerai Luminor Marina watch valued at £3,000 are also listed among his assets.

He also was found guilty of two charges of providing false information.

{ "title":"Southern rail strike: Acas talks to take place on Wednesday", "content": "Talks will be held at Acas today in an attempt to resolve the Southern trains dispute, as the strike that has stopped all of its services and caused chaos for thousands of passengers continues into a second day. Southern rail strike causes worst disruption in 20 years – live updates Read more The news came after a day of recriminations from both sides, with the train drivers’ union Aslef accusing the government of blocking serious talks and manipulating the Southern dispute while the transport secretary, Chris Grayling, said the unions had embarked on an unnecessary political strike. Mick Whelan, Aslef’s general secretary, said: “The government is underwriting and causing the pain and misery of the travelling public. The reality is that the whole of this has been driven by the Department for Transport and their desire for driver-only operation.” Tory MP Chris Philp, who represents the badly affected constituency of Croydon South, called for urgent legislation to end the misery for passengers. Philp, one member of a group that has been meeting regularly with Grayling and minister Paul Maynard, said he wanted a rule that when a strike occurs on critical public infrastructure, at least a 50% service is maintained and the strike should be “reasonable and proportionate”. He also said it should be mandatory to attend mediation at Acas. The Guardian understands that Grayling had an amicable meeting with Tory MPs on Tuesday and has agreed to keep legislation on the table, but because of the time that would be involved it is not his preferred option. Grayling said he was willing to meet unions and released a letter to Aslef complaining that he had had no reply to his offer of a meeting, subject to Aslef calling off strikes. Whelan responded: “In one breath, he’s saying he won’t get involved; in the other, he’s saying we’re refusing to meet him. But why would we if he’s not going to say anything?” The chance of an imminent breakthrough appears slim, as previous talks have broken down with no other concessions offered before talks begin. Whelan said: “We’re always open to talks. We want to move this forward. We don’t want to have people out on the streets losing money. But the attitude of the minister and the government doesn’t allow the franchisee any latitude to move. The company have got to be involved, but we have to feel that they have the latitude to talk.” When, where and why is the Southern rail strike taking place? Read more All of Southern’s 2,242 weekday services, which normally carry more than 300,000 passengers, were cancelled, causing the worst strike-led disruption since privatisation. Passengers who attempted to use other methods of travel were hampered by severe traffic congestion and overcrowded buses and trams, compounded by problems on the Victoria tube line, which resulted in crowds being locked outside its southern terminus in Brixton at rush hour. A commuter group is planning a protest march from Southern’s major London hub, Victoria, to the Department for Transport on Thursday evening, calling for Grayling to quit unless he can restore services. Aslef said Southern’s owner, Govia Thameslink Railway, appeared to reject a potential agreement in talks held in September after consultation with the DfT. Whelan said: “On Sunday, we were having private and confidential conversations with the company. I was unaware that Mr Grayling was privy to or organising those conversations until this morning when I heard him on the Today programme.” Earlier, when asked if he would consider stripping GTR of the franchise, or making it harder for transport unions to strike, Grayling told the BBC: “We are thinking very carefully about how we take things forward. I’m not going to rule anything in or anything out today.” Grayling said the strike was completely unnecessary and that use of driver-only operated trains – the issue at the heart of the dispute – happened elsewhere on the London-Brighton line and beyond. “The reality is these are systems they have been using for years and have been passed as perfectly safe,” he said. “No one’s losing their job, no one’s losing any money. These guys have got long-term job security and yet the union’s insisting on bringing the network to a halt and causing chaos when the independent inspector says it is perfectly safe. If that’s not politically motivated, I don’t know what is.” GTR had continued to take legal action against Aslef until Monday afternoon, when the court of appeal again dismissed the company’s attempt to win an injunction to stop the strike. Any possible resolution will not come in time for Southern services to be restored on Wednesday, when the strike will continue, with a further 24-hour strike by drivers on Friday. An ongoing overtime ban will seriously disrupt services on Thursday and beyond, while conductors in the RMT union will walk out for two days from Monday.",diasaster:0},

But my interest is not with any political side. It’s with victims of state terror, and all the civilians whose lives have been shattered by a war that has been raging for more than five years. It is the most cynical conflict I have seen in 25 years of war reporting. Both the regime and opposition are guilty of war crimes, though one much more than the other. Aleppo’s people are being slaughtered. Did we learn nothing from Srebrenica? | Nedžad Avdić Read more What I’m considering now, from the comfort of my Paris home, is how a city falls. I am thinking of people cowering in basements and struggling with whether they flee from their city now, or wait. Who is coming to save them, or kill them? I know how that scenario goes. I lived through Sarajevo during the Bosnia war, and was in Grozny when it fell to (or was “liberated” by) Russian forces. I remember hiding in those basements waiting for the Russian tanks to come into the village, and wondering if I would be dead in a few hours. I am thinking about the civilians – all of those people with whom I sat for hours while writing my book, or writing reports for the UN high commissioner for refugees – and what they are doing to survive. My agonised frustration from watching the fall of Aleppo (or “retaking” it, in the words of the Syrian government) in real time was vented in a tweet I wrote: “Today I feel like a failure. Nearly 25 years reporting war crimes has added up to nothing. We said ‘never again’. What happened? #Aleppo”. I use Twitter every day, but usually by re-posting articles of interest, and basically I only read tweets and articles on social media that are written about my region of speciality, the Middle East and north Africa. So when my tweet went viral I realised how many people misunderstood the Syrian conflict. The response was a lesson in public awareness, and the failure of the international community – and our leaders – not only to do more to end the war, but to communicate this brutal crisis accurately. The war in Syria is not simply a war against terrorists – Isis and al-Nusra, the al-Qaida franchise in Syria – although this is the narrative the Russian Federation and its allies want us to believe. It started as a peaceful insurrection in 2011, an uprising in the long chain of the Arab spring, which turned to arms, and then turned into a civil war and a humanitarian catastrophe.

One tweeter, called Partisan Girl, wrote: “You started supporting Al Qaeda and regime change wars. Abject failure.” So, she thought I supported al-Qaida? And she attributed this so-called support to the fact that I wrote about war crimes in Syria, from both sides? If my reading of her response is correct, then it has verified for me the twisted narrative that has been applied to the crisis. Another tweeter wrote: “When I served in the US military, al Qaeda was the enemy, not the ally of our illegally baked regime change proxies.” Who, I want to ask, is backing al-Qaida? Not me, and not civilians who just want to get on with their lives and live in peace. I want to write back to the trolls who are now calling me “terrorist scum” that I loathe Isis – they beheaded my friend Steve Sotloff, a journalist just doing his job, in 2014. I equally loathe al-Nusra. Both unleashed untold murderous brutality throughout Syria. But terrorists are not civilians, as our leaders have led us to believe by failing to act because they thought it was too “complicated”. Syria has become a proxy war, but it could have been stopped long ago. Now, however, all the countries that have a stake in this war are more concerned with their vested interests than with the fate of people starving to death or being told: “Surrender or die.” How Britain and the US decided to abandon Srebrenica to its fate Read more The international community has a lot to answer for. President Obama checked out, morally and otherwise, after the 2013 Ghouta chemical attacks on rebel-held areas of Damascus – which the UN confirmed was the worst chemical weapons attack in 25 years. He ruled out any kind of US-led ground invasion because: the war had become too messy; the rise of Isis; his own concerns over his domestic optics. He left a void that was filled, too quickly, by other world leaders, such as Vladimir Putin. Except Obama missed the point. It wasn’t just another Middle Eastern war. The sorrow of Syria has now spread its web across the region, and into Europe. Aside from the millions of refugees, the thousands of homes destroyed, the millions of children who are uneducated, the millions whose lives were cut in half – and the roll call of the dead – you will now have the anger of Muslim people around the world who believe Aleppo was left to rot. The difference with Sarajevo is that my journalist colleagues and I were able to make a difference, somehow, on policy (though our warnings about Srebrenica went unheeded until it was too late). Throughout this war my sense was that Barack Obama and David Cameron (and now Theresa May) were never listening.",diasaster:0},]
